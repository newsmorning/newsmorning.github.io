# Never Throw Away Your 8Bitdo N30 Joystick Again - Learn How to Repair it Like a Pro!

Have you ever had a favorite gaming accessory that suddenly stopped working? If you’re a gamer, this is a common problem that can be incredibly frustrating. One such accessory is the 8Bitdo N30 joystick. While this fantastic retro-style joystick is built to last, it can still break down over time. However, before you throw it away and buy a new one, why not consider repairing it yourself like a pro?

In this article, we’ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to repair your 8Bitdo N30 joystick like a pro.

## Inspect the Joystick

First things first, you need to inspect the joystick to identify the problem. In most cases, malfunctioning joysticks are either unplugged or have a loose connection. Before you take any further steps, make sure to check the wire connection and see whether they need tightening.

If your joystick is still not working, then you'll have to look for other possible problems that might be causing the issue.

## Disassemble the Joystick

Now that you’ve inspected the joystick and identified the problem, it's time to disassemble it. Take apart the joystick and remove the black rubber boot, the circuit board, and the metal cap.

Before you proceed, be sure to take note of the positioning of every part to ensure that you reassemble the joystick correctly. Also, keep all the parts in a safe place where you can easily find them.

## Clean the Circuit Board

Once you have disassembled the joystick, it's time to clean the circuit board. Using a light brush, gently clean the board surface to remove any dirt, debris, or sticky residue that may have accumulated. You can also use a can of compressed air to remove the dirt in hard-to-reach areas.

While cleaning the board, look for areas where corrosion or rust may have formed. Use a clean, dry cloth to remove these substances and ensure that the board is dry before you move forward.

## Inspect the Microswitches

The next step is to inspect the microswitches on the joystick. Use a multimeter to check whether the switches are working correctly. If you find any switches that do not work, you'll need to replace them.

You can buy microswitches from most electronic stores, and they are not expensive. Once you have replaced the switches, make sure to test the joystick again before reassembling it.

## Reassemble the Joystick

After you have completed all the steps mentioned above, it's time to reassemble the joystick. This is the reverse of the first step, so make sure that all the parts are in their correct positions.

Once you have reassembled the joystick, test it to make sure it is working correctly. You can test it by connecting it to your computer or console and trying out different games.

## Conclusion

Repairing your 8Bitdo N30 joystick can seem daunting at first, but it's a straightforward process that anyone can do with the right tools. With this guide, you can repair your joystick like a pro and not have to worry about throwing it away.

Remember to keep your joystick clean and properly maintained, and it will last you for years to come. Happy gaming!
