WARNING: Your iPhone 7's home button could be a ticking time bomb after Apple battery replacement - here's what you need to know!

It's no secret that the iPhone 7 has caused a lot of buzz in the smartphone world. With its sleek design, advanced camera features, and user-friendly interface, it's no wonder that it's become one of the most popular phones on the market. However, recent reports have surfaced that suggest that the iPhone 7's home button could be a ticking time bomb after Apple battery replacement.

The home button is an essential part of any iPhone, allowing users to easily navigate between apps, take screenshots, and return to the home screen. However, if your iPhone 7's home button malfunctions after a battery replacement, things could quickly go south.

Why is the home button at risk?

According to recent reports, Apple's battery replacement program may be the cause of the problem. Under this program, customers can have their iPhone batteries replaced at an affordable price. However, if the replacement is not done correctly, it could put the home button's functionality at risk.

When Apple replaces the iPhone's battery, they must disconnect the home button's cable as part of the process. If this connection is not made correctly, the home button may not work properly. In some cases, it may work sporadically or not at all, leaving users stranded with a phone that's virtually unusable.

What can you do to protect your iPhone?

If you've had your iPhone 7 battery replaced by Apple or any other authorized service provider, it's important to keep a close eye on your home button's functionality. If you notice any issues with your home button, speak to your Apple technician right away.

One possible solution is to have your battery replaced again, ensuring that the cable connection is made correctly this time. However, this solution can be costly and time-consuming, so it's best to get it right the first time around.

Another option is to consider getting an external home button. These can be added to your iPhone 7 and act as a workaround for the built-in home button. While this solution may not be ideal, it can serve as a temporary fix until you can get your home button fixed or replaced.

Finally, be sure to choose an experienced, reputable service provider when getting your iPhone 7's battery replaced. A qualified technician will know how to properly disconnect and reconnect the home button's cable, ensuring that your phone works perfectly after the battery replacement.

In conclusion, if you've had your iPhone 7's battery replaced recently, keep a close eye on your home button's functionality. If you notice any issues, don't hesitate to speak to your Apple technician or seek out a reputable service provider for help. By taking the necessary precautions, you can ensure that your phone remains in pristine condition, and you can continue to enjoy all of its fantastic features without any worry.

## Chosen Solution
 I took my iPhone 7 in for a battery replacement at the Apple Store 2 days ago and ever since the home button has been incredibly sensitive to the slightest touch and the engine goes mad if I hold the button.  Ive tried adjusting the setting in accessibility and home button menues but neither have any effect.
Im taking it back to the Apple Store in a few days, is there anything else I can try before then and if not, should Apple cover the repair costs?

 I’d guess they tightened the screw on the home button too loosely/tightly, although I’d have to see the phone to be sure.
In any event, if it wasn’t that sensitive before and it became that oversensitive after the battery replacement, then they should absolutely be footing the repair costs (if any) for the home button. (Though based on the way they usually do things, you might have to fight them a bit on it to get them to cover it).

 they have damaged the flex on the homebutton when opening the phone. They need to replace the homebutton.

 Hmmm they managed to remove the home button to replace the battery. Uhhh the battery is not undernwither the home button. Glad the apple techs removed sh*t just cause what h*ll why not. Rather then removing what's needed to be the most efficient. Ohh and so they don't increase the variables of something else going wrong where the untrained idiots start poking around.
Gotta love even OEM repairs, somehow they still manage to f*ck it up. And even worse the touch I'd of the home button is tied to hardware on the mobo. So if u replace it the mobo goes as well. Increasing the costs quite a bit, what a disappointment on apples part.
Best of luck.
