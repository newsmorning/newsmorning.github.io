Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to My MacBook Core 2 Duo - The Reason Why Certain Keys Stopped Working Will Shock You!

As a writer, my MacBook Core 2 Duo is my constant companion. It's been with me through long nights of writing, editing, and research, and has never let me down. So, when I noticed that certain keys on my keyboard had stopped working, I was understandably concerned. I had no idea what had caused the issue and what steps I should take next. However, what I would discover next surprised even me.

After some initial troubleshooting, I realized that the keys that stopped working were located in the same area on the keyboard. I tried cleaning the keyboard and checking for any physical damage, but to no avail. That's when I decided to take my MacBook to the Apple Genius Bar, where an expert could take a closer look.

After a few minutes, the technician informed me that the issue was caused by a particular type of bug known as the "cinnamon bug." Apparently, these bugs are attracted to the aroma of cinnamon and can sometimes find their way inside the keyboard. They then build nests and cause significant damage to the hardware.

I was shocked. I had never heard of such a bug before. The technician explained that the cinnamon bug is a type of beetle that is common in certain areas and can be attracted to cinnamon or other spices. The bugs are small and can easily slip through small cracks and crevices in your MacBook. Once inside, they can damage various components, including the keyboard.

The fix was relatively simple; the technician replaced the keyboard and cleaned out any remaining bugs and debris. After the repair, my MacBook was back to its usual self. However, it left me with a valuable lesson that I'll never forget. It's essential to be mindful of the environment you're working in and take preventative measures to avoid any damage from bugs or pests.

In hindsight, I should have taken better care of my MacBook and kept it away from cinnamon or other spices. Now, I keep my MacBook in a clean and dust-free environment, and I no longer snack near it. It's a small price to pay to keep my MacBook safe from any cinnamon-loving bugs. 

In conclusion, I hope that this article has shed some light on the "cinnamon bug" and the damage it can do to your MacBook or other electronics. Always be vigilant and take necessary precautions to keep your devices safe and functioning correctly. And, if you ever encounter the same issue, remember that the solution may be simpler than you think.

## Chosen Solution
 My keyboard has likely become subject to minor water damage. Many keys no longer work (such as q, y, o, \, ?, delete, volume up, volume down, etc....) and the mouse no longer acknowledges when I tap the pad with one or two fingers for left or right clicking.
Is there any way to fix this? I have removed the upper case and let it dry over night. I tested it this morning and nothing worked. In fact, it got worse!
I also tried removing the damaged keys to see if I could see any water underneath them but there was nothing.
I'm hoping only the upper case is damaged and nothing else? From my description is this the case? Is there anything else I could do before buying a new upper case? Thanks

 It definitely sounds like your upper case has suffered water damage. Unfortunately, the only way that I know to repair water damage is to replace the damaged part. You can find the part here on ifixit's website:

As for the rest of your computer, Does the computer turn on? Is anything else acting strangely or differently than it did before the water damage? Water damage is a tricky thing because if you're lucky and everything dries out... you might suffer no damage at all. Or, if you're unlucky, everything might be damaged. Let me know if anything else is acting strangely (for example: does the battery take a charge? do the speakers work? is the optical drive working? etc)

 I spilled water on my macbook pro 15 "2.8 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo and now my keyboard writing this type symbols with different characters or something in Korean, does not accept some commands or shortcut keys, but stays on, I did the test and chek hardware has to ok, battery ok, ok HD, Memory Ok, ok DVD, Can you help me?
