Title: The Mysterious Culprit Blocking Your Pal Super Nintendo Games from Starting Beyond The Title Screen

Are you a fan of classic video games? Perhaps you’re one of the lucky ones who owns a Pal Super Nintendo console. If so, you might have experienced the frustration of a game that refuses to start beyond the title screen. It’s a common issue, and for many years gamers have been unable to figure out the cause. But worry not dear reader, for today we will be discussing the mysterious culprit that is blocking your Pal Super Nintendo games from starting.

Firstly, the cause of this issue can be attributed to the difference between the Pal (European) and the NTSC (American) systems. The Pal system runs at 50Hz, whereas the NTSC runs at 60Hz. If you’re trying to play a game that was made specifically for the NTSC system on your Pal console, it can cause the game to freeze at the title screen. 

But what about games that are specifically made for the Pal system? Why are they also not starting up beyond the title screen? One reason could be that the console’s voltage regulator is failing. The voltage regulator is responsible for ensuring the correct amount of power is delivered to key parts of the system. If it’s faulty, it can cause the console to freeze at the title screen, or even fail to load a game altogether.

Another probable cause of this issue is the console's game cartridge slot. Over time, this component can become dirty or dusty, causing games to make poor contact with the console. You can try cleaning the cartridge slot with rubbing alcohol to see if it fixes the issue.

Lastly, it could also be an issue related to the console's internal memory. Similar to the voltage regulator and cartridge slot, the internal memory can degrade over time, causing issues with loading games. Resetting the console by pressing the reset button repeatedly may sometimes fix the problem.

The Pal Super Nintendo is a classic console that’s adored by many gamers around the world. If you’re facing issues with your game not starting beyond the title screen, there are a few simple things you can try before giving up hope. First, check the compatibility of the game with the system. Next, ensure the voltage regulator is working correctly, and try cleaning the cartridge slot. Lastly, try resetting the console. Hopefully, one of these solutions will save you the frustration of not being able to enjoy your favorite classic games. Happy gaming!

## Chosen Solution
 I recently got a PAL SNES from a car boot sale and can’t seem to get it to work. The console powers up but will not go beyond the title screen for any of the games I have tried. I’ve taken it apart and can’t see any obvious damage anywhere. I cleaned the cartridge slot with isopropyl alcohol, hoping for some tips on what to check next before biting the bullet and getting another console.

 have you tried the games on another SNES or try another controller,as it could simply be that the controller isn't working rather then the console or the games.
