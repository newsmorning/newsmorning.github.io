If you have a slow connection, consider upgrading your internet plan, or switch to a different provider.


## 2. Use Ethernet Instead of Wi-Fi

Consider pausing or reducing other online activities, especially those that use a lot of bandwidth. This includes downloads, online gaming, and video calls that can slow down your internet speed.


## 4. Clear Your Device's Cache and Cookies

Sometimes, the cause of buffering issues can be due to accumulated cache and cookies in your device's storage. These unwanted files can slow down your device's performance and cause buffering issues when you try to stream videos. To fix this issue, clear your device's cache and cookies regularly, and this will help to improve your device's performance.


## 5. Update Your Device's Software

Your device's software can also play a crucial role in fixing buffering issues on Peacock TV. Ensure that your device's software is up-to-date, as software updates come with bug fixes and optimization that can improve your device's performance. Ensure that your device's operating system and your Peacock TV app are up-to-date to ensure a seamless streaming experience.
