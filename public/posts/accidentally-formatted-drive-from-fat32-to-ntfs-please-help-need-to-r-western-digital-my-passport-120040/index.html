Accidentally Converted Fat32 to NTFS and Lost All Your Data?! Don’t Panic - Here’s The Solution! We have all been there before. One moment you are trying to convert a hard drive from Fat32 to NTFS and the next thing you know, you have lost all your data! The experience can be panic-inducing, especially if you do not have a backup. But before you throw in the towel and give up on your data, there are some things you can do to recover your data. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to recover your data, so don’t panic – here’s the solution!\n##Step 1: Stop Using the Drive\nFirst things first, before you start any recovery process, you need to stop using the drive immediately! Do not write new files, save data, install software or do anything that might overwrite the data you are trying to recover. It is crucial to avoid overwriting any “deleted” files to maximize the chances of a successful recovery.\n##Step 2: Use Data Recovery Software\nThe next step is to use data recovery software to try and retrieve your lost data. There are many free and paid data recovery software options that you can download online, but a few popular options include Recuva, EaseUS Data Recovery, and Stellar Data Recovery. These software programs are designed to scan the drive and recover any deleted or lost files.\nWhen using data recovery software, make sure that you select the right file system that you were using before you converted to NTFS. If you are unsure about the file system, select both NTFS and FAT32 to improve the chances of recovery.\n##Step 3: Recover the Data to Another Disk\nOnce you have the data recovery software running, select the files you want to recover, and then recover them to another drive. Do not recover the data to the same drive that you are trying to recover from as this could overwrite previously deleted files.\n##Step 4: Test the Recovered Data\nBefore you celebrate your successful data recovery, you need to check the recovered data to make sure that it is stable and not corrupt. Open and test each file to ensure that you can access it and that it is complete. You can also use a program like WinRAR to test the files for any corruption.\n##Step 5: Prevent Future Data Loss\nNow that you have recovered your data, it’s essential to take steps to prevent future data loss. Ensure that you have a backup of all critical files and data. You can use cloud-based services like Dropbox, Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to back up your files automatically. You can also invest in external hard drives to keep your data safe and secure.\n##Conclusion\nLosing your data can be a nightmare, but with the steps listed above, there is hope for recovering your lost files. Remember, the crucial thing to do is to stop using the drive immediately and run data recovery software before taking any further action. And most importantly, make sure that you back up all critical files and data to prevent future data loss.\nChosen Solution Lost files was Fat32 now NTFS, PLEASE HELP\nHi, If you haven’t written to the drive yet then there’s a chance that your data hasn’t been overwritten and that it can be recovered OK. Search online for formatted hard drive without backup to find 3rd party software that will enable you to recover the data. I assume that the drive wasn’t backed up before you did this?\n","wordCount":"593","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tina Mcclain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/accidentally-formatted-drive-from-fat32-to-ntfs-please-help-need-to-r-western-digital-my-passport-120040/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>DISASTER STRIKES!
