Phones have become essential tools in our lives. We use them to communicate with our loved ones, browse the internet, and watch our favorite movies and TV shows.

A faulty charger port is a common issue that many phone users face, but what if we told you that changing the charger port on your LG K20 Plus is easier than you think?

In this article, we will be revealing the secrets to easily changing your charger port on the LG K20 Plus, without the need for professional help.

What You Will Need:

Before we dive into the process of changing your charger port, here are the tools you will need:

1. A new charging port flex cable for the LG K20 Plus. You can purchase it online or from your local phone repair shop.
2. Plastic pry tools, a set of screwdrivers, and tweezers.

Step 1: Disassemble Your LG K20 Plus

The first step in changing your charger port is to disassemble your LG K20 Plus. To do this, turn off your phone and remove the back cover. Next, remove the battery and SIM card tray.

Use the plastic pry tool to remove the plastic covers around the phone's body. This will reveal the screws that hold the phone's body together. Use the appropriate screwdriver to remove these screws, and carefully detach the phone's back cover and the antenna cable.

Step 2: Detach the Charging Port Flex Cable

After removing the back covers and screws, the charging port flex cable will be visible. Use the tweezers to disconnect the charging port flex cable from the phone's board. The charging port flex cable is held in place with adhesive, so be careful when removing it.

Step 3: Install the New Charging Port Flex Cable

Now it's time to install the new charging port flex cable. Simply attach the new charging port flex cable to the phone's board, and then replace the antenna cable and back covers in reverse order of their removal. Make sure the screws are tightened properly, and the phone's body is secured.

Step 4: Test Your LG K20 Plus

After successfully installing the new charging port flex cable, you can now test your phone. Re-insert the battery and SIM card tray, and turn on your LG K20 Plus. Plug in your charger and make sure that the phone is charging properly.

Conclusion:

As you can see, changing the charger port on your LG K20 Plus is a simple process that can be performed at home without the need for professional help. With the right tools, patience, and care, you can easily install a new charging port flex cable and get your phone back to its fully functional self.

We hope these tips have been helpful for you. Remember to proceed with caution when disassembling your phone, and if you do not feel confident in your abilities, seek professional assistance. Happy repairing!

 Hi @jac74 ,
It’s not that hard but you need to have smd (surface mounted device) soldering skills and tools to do the repair.
It is not a job for novices, but if you decide to try it, practice on some old faulty boards first before working on the phone.
Here’s a link to a video that shows how to remove / replace the charging port on the phone.
