## How can I fix the Dell Docking Station Ethernet not working?
 
### 1. Check the network adapter’s power output

### 4. Check the USB ports

- Press Windows key + R to open Run.
 - Type devmgmt.msc and click OK to open the Device Manager.
 - In the Device Manager, expand the Network adapter section.
 - Right-click on your currently active network and select Properties.
