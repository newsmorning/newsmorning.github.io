The Infinix S5 is the latest smartphone in the Infinix line-up, and it promises to deliver a next-level mobile experience. With a focus on style, performance, and power, this device is sure to impress. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the Infinix S5, unbox it, and share our first impressions.

Unboxing
Our unboxing experience was top-notch. The Infinix S5 arrived in a sleek, white box that looks premium. As soon as we opened the box, we were greeted by the Infinix S5, which looked stunning. The device comes in a gradient finish with a choice of Quetzal Cyan, Violet, and Nebula Black colors, which gives it a unique look.

Inside the box, we found a charging brick, a USB cable, a pair of earbuds, and a clear protective case. The inclusion of earbuds was a nice touch, and we appreciated the clear case, which ensures that the device is protected from scratches and minor drops.

Design
The Infinix S5 has a large 6.6-inch display with an HD+ resolution of 720x1600 pixels. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which is tough enough to withstand minor drops and scratches. The device has a hole-punch notch on the top left corner of the display, which houses the front-facing camera.

The back of the device has a glossy finish with a quad-camera setup and a fingerprint scanner. The camera module is placed in the top left corner of the device and looks sleek. The device has a plastic build, which doesn't feel cheap, and the gradient finish adds to its overall appeal.

Performance
The Infinix S5 is powered by a MediaTek Helio P22 processor and has 4GB of RAM. The device runs on Android 9 Pie with Infinix's XOS 5.5 UI on top. The user interface is smooth and easy to navigate. We didn't experience any lag or stuttering while navigating through the phone.

The device has a large 4,000mAh battery, which lasted through a full day of moderate usage. The device supports quick charging but doesn't come with a fast charger in the box.

Camera
The camera is one of the standout features of the Infinix S5. The device has a quad-camera setup on the back, which includes a 16-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and a low light sensor. The front-facing camera is a 32-megapixel shooter.

In our testing, we found that the camera performed exceptionally well in daylight conditions. The images were sharp, and the colors were vivid. The ultra-wide camera captured a wider field of view, making it perfect for landscape photography. The low light sensor did a decent job in low light conditions, but we did notice some noise in the images.

Conclusion
Our first impressions of the Infinix S5 are positive. The device has an attractive design, a smooth user interface, and a good camera. The inclusion of earbuds and a clear case adds value to the package. However, the device could have used a faster charger in the box.

Overall, the Infinix S5 is a great smartphone for daily use, and it delivers a premium experience at a mid-range price point. If you're in the market for a new smartphone, we highly recommend checking out the Infinix S5.

The Infinix S5 has been out for quite a while now, having been first unveiled back in October 2019. Nine months into the device’s life and still, it remains very relevant in the market, thanks in part, to its specs and price.
 
The device is readily available in many stores across the country and due to the attention the device has been getting, we thought it wise to get one and tell you all about it.
 
## Infinix S5 Unboxing: What’s in the Box?
 
First up, the unboxing. Once you get the phone, these are the items you will find in the box.
 
- Infinix S5Power brickMicro USB CableA pair of earphonesA plastic screen protectorA silicon caseUser manualSIM Ejector toolWarranty card

 
The first thing you will notice about the device is its heft. This is a beefy device. And I am coming from a Pocophone F1 that weighs in at 180g. Asides from the weight, however, the Infinix S5 is a beautiful device. I have the Violet color option and it pops!
 
The device has a mic, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a micro USB port and the speaker at the bottom. The right hand side has the volume rockers and the power button.
 
The left hand side has the dedicated Dual SIM and SD Card tray and up top, the phone is bare.
 
The device’s specs are highlighted below.

Generally, the device feels well built. The first boot took less than a minute and the initial setup is the one we’ve come to know and love. No surprises here.
 
The surprise came once the device was booted up. The sheer number of pre-loaded apps is alarming. See, I am a stock Android kinda guy. I got rid of MIUI less than a week after purchasing my previous device in favor of Android 10’s stock-looking Lineage OS.
 
This build of XOS comes with many of the Stock Google apps we have come to rely on over the years, like Chrome, Gmail, Drive, Google Photos, and many others, preinstalled.
 
The company also took the liberty to pre-install a bunch of its apps like;
 
- VAHA Games,CarlcareFicool BooksPalm StoreScooperVskitXClubXshare

 
Also preinstalled are some games like Danger Dash and Fruit Frolic. If I have one suggestion for Infinix developers, it would be to ask them to tone this down a notch or two.
 
The default launcher is also a bit much as it comes with tons of ads. See attached image for illustration.
 
Since the device has been out for several months, I will be on the look out for updates to the device and see if they change the experience, if at all,
 
I will be using the Infinix S5 for the next couple of days as my daily driver and in the process, I will try pushing it to the absolute limits and report back on my findings in my upcoming review of this device. Stay tuned for that.
