## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I have a LG 49UF6430-UB.AUSYLJR for 2 years now. This past week it started  flickering the left half of the panel.
My impression, is that it seems the Smart TV overlay is flickering, not the whole panel. I say this, because when it's flickering, I can't access Input, Options, or any Smart Apps.
Sometimes it stops, and when it does, i can access all menus perfectly.
There is  someone in Youtube with what seems to be the exact same issue as mine. It seems like he solved it replacing the main board.

Have anyone seen a similar issue?  I'd like to try to confirm before buying the main board.

 Yah its wear on the board. Unfortunately new tvs are designed to fail like this so you keep buying new tvs from the brands its really sick how selfish bug companies are with money. But new board = fixed
