The Ring Doorbell has made the news on several occasions because families were finding out the device could be hacked. Hackers can gain access to the video footage and take over the microphone. This security risk is very concerning and you need to be aware of what to do to prevent this risk from happening.
 
There have been instances where the hacker speaks to people seen in the footage in very scary, harassing tones once they take over the device. There have even been reports of a homeowner letting in who they thought was a friend at the front door but it turns out the hacker took over the footage and the homeowner let in a stranger! Read on to learn some ways to prevent your Ring Doorbell from being hacked.
 
## Be Sure All of Your Usernames and Passwords are Secure
 
- Passwords should always contain numbers, letters, capitals and symbols

 
- Never use anything familiar such as personal information

 
- Change your passwords frequently

 
- Create a unique password for all items

 
Weak passwords are one of the most common ways a hacker can get into your WiFi network.
 
## Avoid Sharing Videos With Friends and Family
 
We all catch hilarious footage we want to share with our closest friends and family. It could be as harmless as your husband slipping on the porch getting the newspaper one morning while leaving for work.
 
Your Ring Doorbell may have captured a cute video of the neighborhood raccoon sneaking treats out of your bird feeder.
 
You have to try your best to resist the temptation to share the footage. When you send video footage to your family, neighbors, or friends in text messages or put the video on any social media platform, it only opens up access for a hacker to be able to find a way in.
 
Once your video is copied and sent, it no longer has the security protection provided by the Ring Doorbell.
 
## Be Sure to Upgrade Your Ring Software
 
Staying on top of your Ring Doorbell’s software updates allows it to remain secure. Keeping up to date on the firmware also continues to make sure the device will react when someone is within range.
 
Firmware is built into your device and its sole purpose is to keep your device functioning properly. A device that functions at its best will give you the most efficient result. Most devices will update their firmware automatically but it doesn’t hurt to look up your device’s instructions and run a manual update once in a while.
 
## Purchase an Antivirus Service
 
You can always go the extra mile and purchase an antivirus service. You can buy this service as a backup to the Ring’s installed security. Antivirus software helps prevent viruses and detect malware to stop hacking before it starts. Malware is software hackers create to cause damage to computers, servers, and networks.
 
Purchasing an extra antivirus software will help you feel more confident about any security issues you think your Ring Doorbell may have.
 
## Do Not Keep Old Video Footage
 
When you keep a lot of video footage on your Ring Doorbell you are opening up access to hackers. The more videos you keep, the more vulnerable you are to being targeted. Get into the habit of going into your video footage every few days or even daily if possible and remove anything not needed. The cleaner your footage library is the safer you are from hackers.
 
If a hacker gains access to your old footage, they could find out information about what is inside your home, your daily routine, work schedule, and activities. The hacker could then use their knowledge in the worst possible scenarios.
 
## Final Thoughts
 
The Ring Doorbell has been welcomed by many homeowners. It provides peace of mind when you are at work, on vacation, or simply not at home.
 
There are so many fun uses of the Ring Doorbell. The device captures video motion and allows you to see a video stream of the person at your door and you can even speak to them through a microphone.
 
The Ring allows you to catch a glimpse of your family when you are not at home and you never have to wonder again if your packages were delivered to the right place while you are at work. By following the few simple guidelines mentioned above, you can rest easy knowing you have done everything possible to enjoy your new Ring Doorbell.
