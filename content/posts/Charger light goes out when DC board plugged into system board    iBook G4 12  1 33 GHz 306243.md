Title: The Mysterious Behavior of the iBook G4 Charger Light

If you're a tech-savvy person, you might have heard about the iBook G4. This Apple laptop was released in 2003 and discontinued in 2006, but it still holds a special place in the hearts of vintage computer enthusiasts. However, there's one curious feature of the iBook G4 that not many people know about - the behavior of its charger light when you plug in the DC board.

Before we delve into this mystery, here's a quick overview of how the iBook G4 works. Like most laptops, it has a battery that powers the computer when it's not plugged into an outlet. To charge the battery, you connect the laptop to an AC adapter, which has a cord that ends in a MagSafe connector. This connector snaps into a port on the side of the iBook G4 and uses magnetic force to stay in place.

However, the iBook G4 also has another port called the DC-in board. This port is used to charge the battery directly, bypassing the AC adapter. To use the DC-in board, you need a special cable that connects to the board on one end and to a power source on the other end, such as a car adapter or an airplane seat power outlet.

Now, here's where things get interesting. When you plug the DC board into the iBook G4, the charger light on the laptop suddenly goes out. This might seem like a glitch or a malfunction, but it's actually a deliberate design feature.

According to Apple's documentation for the iBook G4, the charger light is meant to indicate the status of the AC adapter. When the light is orange, it means the battery is charging; when it's green, it means the battery is fully charged; and when it's off, it means the AC adapter is not connected or not working properly.

When you use the DC-in board to charge the iBook G4, the laptop switches from using the AC adapter to using the DC input. This means that the charger light is no longer relevant, since it doesn't reflect the status of the battery anymore. Instead of staying on and confusing the user, the charger light simply turns off to indicate that it's not needed.

So, there you have it - the mystery of the iBook G4 charger light has been solved. While it might seem strange at first, the behavior of the charger light when you plug in the DC board is actually a clever design choice that simplifies the charging process. Next time you're using an iBook G4 and the charger light goes out, remember that it's not a bug, it's a feature!

## Chosen Solution
 The two-year-old dumped over a cup of coffee into the iBook.  After drying, it was still working, but was in need of a good cleaning.  The charger connection had also been a bit touch, so figured it would be a good time to make sure the DC board was OK.
Dismantled and thoroughly cleaned.  The DC board issues appeared to be the contacts inside the jack.  Adjusted them a bit for better connection.
While removing the top cover, the trackpad connection pulled off the system board.  Resoldered that.  Wanted to make sure my work was good, but no power, and no charge going to battery.  If I disconnect the DC board from the system board, the charger plug glows as expected.  As soon as it's connected to the system board, it goes out.
Anything simple that could fix this, or am I looking at a new system board?

Stop giving two-year olds coffee, the caffeine makes them shakie and they tend to spill things ;-)  If this fails you can try replacing the DC-IN board as they are not to expensive.  After that the costs to repair are higher than what the thing is worth.  Sell it for parts on eBay.
