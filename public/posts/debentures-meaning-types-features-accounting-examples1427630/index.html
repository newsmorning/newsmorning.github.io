Instead, the investors consider the issuer’s creditworthinessCreditworthinessCreditworthiness is a measure of judging the loan repayment history of borrowers to ascertain their worth as a debtor who should be extended a future credit or not.

In addition, the issuer enjoys low-cost borrowing since they offer a lower interest rate than non-covertibles. Repayments can be attained either in installments payable yearly or all at once.

Conversely, when the interest rates are floating, they vary with the changes in their benchmark rate.

Thus, for example, if a $150 debenture is issued and redeemed at par, the journal entries in accounting are as follows:\nIssued at Premium\nWhen the issue is at a price surpassing the investment’s face value, they are deemed to be issued at a premium.
