Is Your Kenmore Elite He3 Washing Machine Broken? Discover the Shocking Truth Behind Its Agitating, Draining, and Spinning Issues – Plus, How to Fix Them in Minutes!

The Kenmore Elite He3 washing machine is a popular choice for homeowners who value quality, efficiency and convenience when it comes to doing laundry. However, even the best appliances can encounter problems at some point, and the Elite He3 is no exception.

If you're experiencing agitating, draining, and spinning issues with your Kenmore Elite He3 washing machine, don't despair. In this article, we'll reveal the shocking truth behind these problems and show you how to fix them without professional help in just a few minutes.

Agitating Issues:

If your Kenmore Elite He3 washing machine is not agitating, the problem may be with the agitator itself. The agitator, which is designed to lift and move your clothes around during the wash cycle, can become detached or stuck, preventing it from working properly. Fortunately, fixing this issue is straightforward. All you need to do is remove the agitator cap and tighten it or clean it thoroughly. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace the agitator altogether.

Draining Issues:

A clogged drain hose or pump is the most common cause of draining issues in the Kenmore Elite He3 washing machine. To solve the problem, check the drain hose for any clogs, and remove them. You should also inspect the pump for any debris and remove it if necessary. If neither of those solutions work, the issue may be with the pump motor, in which case it will need to be replaced.

Spinning Issues:

If your Kenmore Elite He3 washing machine is not spinning, it may be due to a faulty drum belt or a blocked drain pump. Start by checking the drum belt for any signs of wear or damage. If the belt is loose, broken, or worn out, replace it. If the belt is in good condition, then the issue may be with the drain pump. Check the drain pump for any blockages and remove them. If these actions do not work, it is the time to call a professional to avoid further damage.

In conclusion, the Kenmore Elite He3 washing machine can encounter agitating, draining and spinning issues, which can be frustrating for homeowners. But, fixing these problems can be simple and straightforward. By following our tips, you will be able to fix your washing machine in minutes and have it up and running again in no time. Remember, always be careful when working with home appliances and cut power to the appliance before starting any repairs.

## Chosen Solution
 Removed wet clothes, drain with drain tube, and check filter.  Filter is clear.  Hose from water level switch to drum is clear (blew air through it).
Run rinse and spin cycle - Water enters drum, drum agitates in a regular pattern alternating a few revolutions CW then CCW.  This goes on for several minutes.  When completed. all the water is pumped out very quickly.  So I am pretty sure its not the pump or the hoses.    However when all water gone, I can hear the pump continue running (dry) but spin cycle does not start.  After several minutes of this, ND code appears.  ND=not draining but I know it is drained??  Fill level switch?  Door Lock Switch?  Ideas?

Sorry, forgot to mention model is front loading Kenmore 402-49032011.  I did not find this in the list but very simiar to Samsung models I see.

 Hi @gizwidget ,
Found some info online that may or may not be helpful to you.
This link shows that your model may be similar in operation to either a Samsung WF520 or a WF 455 model washer.
Here’s a link to the service manual for a WF520 (don’t be misled see p.1 to verify) that show the possible causes for a ND error code.
Here’s the Technical Information manual for a WF455 which may be a bit more helpful.
On p.2 it shows the causes of a ND error code and on p.19 under Trouble Diagnosis > Will not drain it gives a more detailed list of what to check.
I realize that you said that it does drain but it may be that it is draining too fast perhaps given the water level appropriate to the wash cycle type selected etc. I don’t know but maybe still worth a check if the manual is relevant to your model that is. Apologies if it leads you astray.

 sounds like the water level switch isn't telling the controller that it is empty. I would check there. If the sensor is good and connections intact, then it's a controller issue. But the fact that it recognizes that this is going on makes me lean hard towards the sensor/switch that says its empty and tells the pump to turn off.
