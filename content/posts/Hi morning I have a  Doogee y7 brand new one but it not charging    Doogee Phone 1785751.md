# STOP! Don't Throw Away Your Doogee Y7- Learn The Simple Fix to Get Your New Phone Charging Again!

Doogee Y7 is a budget smartphone that has made waves in the market due to its impressive features and affordable price range. However, like any other electronic device, it's not immune to glitches and problems. One of the most common complaints among Doogee Y7 users is its charging issue. If you're a Doogee Y7 owner who's struggling with charging problems, don't worry! In this article, we'll teach you the simple fix you need to get your new phone charging again.

## The Problem

It's frustrating when you plug in your phone, and it doesn't charge. Or it charges, but the battery drains quickly. You've probably tried changing your charger or even your charging port, but it doesn't seem to solve the problem. This issue can be attributed to a particular hardware glitch that affects the phone's charging capability - a.k.a. the "charging port failure."

## The Solution

The Doogee Y7 charging issue is primarily caused by a loose or damaged USB port. To fix this, you need to replace the device's USB port by following some simple steps. This DIY repair is cheap and easy, and you don't have to be an expert to do it.

Firstly, gather necessary tools - a screwdriver, a new charging port (preferably from an authorized dealer), and tweezers. Next, power off the phone and remove the back cover using a screwdriver. Once you've removed the cover, disconnect the battery and speaker wire, and carefully remove the motherboard. 

After removing the motherboard, gently remove the old USB port with the tweezers. Before replacing it with the new port, clean the area with a brush to ensure it's free of debris. Next, attach the new USB port to the motherboard and reinstall everything you removed, making sure the connectors are correctly placed. 

After reassembling everything, connect the charger and power on the phone. You will notice that the device is now correctly charging. That's it! You've fixed your phone's charging issue and saved a lot of money.

## Conclusion

As you can see, fixing the Doogee Y7 charging issue is not rocket science. You only need to replace the faulty USB port, and your phone is back in action. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can save yourself the cost and inconvenience of buying a new phone.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi .
I have a doogee  Y7 but charging problems

 Hi @ngiola ,
Have you tried a different known working, compatible charger or charging cable?
If so, since it is brand new take it back and ask for a replacement or a refund. Do not void the warranty by trying to open it and fix it yourself
