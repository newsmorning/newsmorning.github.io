# Is Your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 Constantly Swelling? The Unexpected Culprit May Be Your Charger!

If you have a MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012, you may have noticed that your laptop is constantly swelling. This can be a frustrating and concerning problem that can make it difficult to use your laptop. However, the cause of this issue may surprise you – it could be your charger!

The MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 is a popular laptop model that has been praised for its sleek design and reliable performance. However, one of the most common complaints from users is that their laptops are constantly swelling. This can be particularly alarming as a swollen battery could potentially explode.

So, what could be causing this problem? While there are many factors that could contribute to a swollen battery, one of the most unexpected culprits could be your charger. It may seem counterintuitive, but a faulty charger could actually be causing your battery to swell.

When you plug your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 into its charger, the charger delivers a specific amount of power to the battery. If the charger is faulty or the power delivered is inconsistent, it can cause the battery to become overcharged, resulting in the battery swelling.

There are a few signs that your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 may be experiencing charger-related swelling. First, you may notice that the bottom of your laptop is bulging, making it difficult to type or use the trackpad. You may also notice that the battery is running out more quickly than it used to, or that your laptop is running hot.

So, what can you do to prevent this issue? First, it’s important to ensure that you’re using an Apple-certified charger that’s designed to work specifically with your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012. You can verify this by checking the label on your charger - it should say “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” If your charger doesn’t have this label or if it’s damaged, it’s best to replace it with a new one.

Another step you can take is to keep an eye on your charging habits. Try not to leave your laptop plugged in for extended periods of time, as this can cause your battery to overcharge. Also, avoid charging your laptop in places that are too warm or too cold, as extreme temperatures can also damage your battery.

In conclusion, a swollen battery on your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 can be a serious problem, but the cause may be unexpected. A faulty charger can cause the battery to overcharge, resulting in swelling. To prevent this issue, use an Apple-certified charger and be mindful of your charging habits. With the right precautions, you can protect your laptop and prevent swelling from occurring.

## Chosen Solution
 Wondering if charger can affect battery. Charger seems fine. Lights appear to work correctly. Battery charges. But the aftermarket charger is new. Can that cause swelling or is it just the battery

Hi Tom, Thanks for the response. All else in the computer seems to be fine. Battery is a one year old from fixit. I just put in another so we shall see…John

 Unlikely, it’s always the bad motherboard or the battery itself is bad. Charger just supplies power to the board, it doesn’t do anything to the battery.

 Please don't buy a cheap knock off unit as they will damage your system! Get the REAL Apple unit directly from Apple: Apple 60W MagSafe Power Adapter (for MacBook and 13-inch MacBook Pro)
The charging logic gets damaged from the cheap chargers! I’ve seen to many damaged by them and one of my employers cost them 3 million for a person burning out a hotel room because he forgot his and bought one from a local store when traveling on a business trip.
It was so bad we audit all of them 300+ systems and found quite a few! We branded the good ones and replaced the knockoffs. Funny thing! Afterwards we had fewer battery and logic board failures!
