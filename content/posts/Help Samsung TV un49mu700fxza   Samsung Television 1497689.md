# Is Your Samsung TV Un49Mu700Fxza Acting Up? Learn How to Fix it Like a Pro!

If you are a fan of Samsung electronics, you may be familiar with the Samsung TV Un49Mu700Fxza, also known as the MU7000 series. While it is a great TV with excellent picture quality and features, like any technology product, it is not invincible to glitches and malfunctions.

If you are experiencing some issues with your Samsung TV Un49Mu700Fxza, don't panic. Below are some common problems and solutions to help you troubleshoot and fix your TV like a pro.

## The TV Doesn't Turn On

If your TV refuses to turn on, it could be due to a problem with the power supply. First, ensure that the AC cord is firmly plugged into the wall socket and the TV. Also, check for any damage to the power cord, such as cuts or exposing wires.

If the power cord is not the issue, try unplugging the TV from the power source for a few minutes, then plug it back in and attempt to turn it on. A power cycling can help reset the TV and eliminate any temporary faults that could have occurred.

## The TV Screen is Blank

If your TV screen remains black, it could be a sign of a more severe issue. Start by checking the connections between the TV and other devices. Loose cables can cause the TV to display a black screen.

Also, check the TV settings to make sure that the screen is not turned off accidentally, or the brightness setting is set too low. If this doesn't fix the issue, reset the TV to its default settings and see if it solves the problem.

## The Sound Quality is Poor

If you are experiencing poor sound quality, it could be a problem with the speakers. Check if the speakers are turned on and increase the volume to see if it fixed the issue.

Also, ensure that the sound settings are correctly set, such as if the TV speakers are set as the primary audio source. Enabling the TV's sound enhancement features, such as the equalizer or surround sound, can also improve sound quality.

## Conclusion

If you are experiencing issues with your Samsung TV Un49Mu700Fxza, don't panic. The above common troubleshooting and solutions will help you address the problem and get your TV back to its optimal performance.

If your TV continues to malfunction, don't hesitate to contact Samsung's customer support for further assistance. With the right fixes and support, you can get your Samsung TV Un49Mu700Fxza to function as good as new.


## Chosen Solution
 Received a Samsung TV from a friend said it did not work. The TV is black screen. Reading different forums I replaced the motherboard along with power board. Neither has worked. The power button has no light to it when in standby mode. When disconnecting motherboard to power board the back light does turn on. Any ideas what the issue can be?

 @rsastuk “power button has no light to it” odd situation with a new power board. have you measured the voltages coming of the power board. Verify your model number please. I want to make sure it is a un49mu700 and not a 7000. Anyhow not much left to replace. Looks like the T-con board in integrated to the main board. Backlight comes on but no signal etc is commonly the main board but you said you replaced it (reliable supplier?) then the issue could be related to the button bar (check it to see if the buttons work) or the screen. Check your wiring etc. Post some good pictures of all of your boards and the interconnect wires so we can see what you see. Measure the voltages on the connector where the cable from the main board connects to the power board. Compare those with what is printed on the board. Let us know what those values are.
