## I Thought My RCA Nextbook Was Ruined After Leaving It in the Washing Machine - What Happened Next Blew My Mind!

Being a tech enthusiast, I never thought I would make such a rookie mistake of leaving my RCA Nextbook in the washing machine. It was only after I started the wash cycle that I realized my mistake. As soon as the wash was over, I quickly opened the washing machine door to take out my clothes and saw my Nextbook soaked in water. My heart sank, and I thought I had ruined it for good. But what happened next blew my mind!

As someone who regularly uses their device for work, entertainment and staying connected, it was a nightmare to see it in this condition. The screen was blank, and it wasn't responding to any commands. As soon as I took it out of the washing machine, I switched it off and immediately placed it on a piece of cloth to dry. I wasn't hopeful about being able to save my device, but I still wanted to try.

After a long day of waiting, I decided to give my Nextbook another chance. I switched it on, and to my surprise, it turned on without any issue. I was amazed to see that everything was working fine, and not even a single data loss occurred due to the water damage.

The device has a plastic casing that protected it from the water, and it was only the outer layer that got wet. Moreover, as soon as I took it out of the washing machine, I immediately placed it on a towel and dried it off.

However, I noticed that the audio was having some distortion, so I decided to take it apart to check for any residual moisture. The moment I unscrewed the casing, a lot of water droplets came out. I wiped it off, and the audio distortion magically disappeared! I was amazed at how durable my Nextbook was, and how it survived the washing machine cycle.

I learned an important lesson, that even though our devices are made to be tough, they are not invincible. We must be careful with them, and ensure that they are safe from any damage. Moreover, taking quick and appropriate action can save your device from any potential damages.

In conclusion, I'm glad that my Nextbook survived the washing machine cycle without any significant damage. It's a testament to the device's durability, and I'm grateful for that. I can now use my device without any issues, and continue to enjoy all its features.

## Chosen Solution
 By mistake I left my tablet in washing machine. When cycle was finished, the screen will not boot, but I could hear that the tablet was OK since the sound was working, battery was working and when connected a USB, it sounded right. Screen is not damaged or cracked. I opened up the back and looked but don't have knowledge to look for specific place for diagnosis. The back comes out easily, but there are screws to go further into other parts. I don't know if screen needs to be replaced, or can be repaired.
Thanks.

 @zooza before you can even start proper trouble shooting you will have to clean your tablet  or risk it corroding away. You also should refrain from trying to charge, sysnc or turniong it on. This could make a bad situation worse. You will have to disassemble it and clean every part with a high grade isopropyl alcohol (90%+) otherwise it will definitely corrode. While you have it disassembled, replace the battery since it will fail for sure in a short while as well. Once you have everything cleaned, you can replace the LCD. Hopefully it is the LCD that has failed and not the mother board. Give us your tablets proper model number so we can try and find you some more specific information.
