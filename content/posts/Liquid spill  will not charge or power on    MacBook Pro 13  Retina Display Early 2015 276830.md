MacBook Pro is one of the most popular laptops in the world, known for its sleek design and impeccable performance. However, accidents happen, and liquid spills can cause serious damage to your MacBook Pro. Whether you spill water, coffee, or tea on your MacBook Pro, the first reaction is usually panic. But don't worry, all is not lost. Here's what you can do to save your MacBook Pro from liquid damage.

1. Shut down your MacBook Pro

The first thing you need to do is shut down your MacBook Pro immediately. This will prevent any further damage from occurring. Don't just close the lid, but shut it down completely. If your MacBook Pro is still on, shut it down by holding the power button until it turns off.

2. Disconnect all peripherals

It's essential to disconnect all peripherals from your MacBook Pro, including the charger, USB devices, and any other external devices connected to it. This will prevent any electrical shorts from occurring, and help minimize any further damage.

3. Wipe off the liquid spill

Use a clean, dry cloth to carefully wipe off the liquid spill from the MacBook Pro. Be sure to clean the laptop carefully, especially around the keyboard and any other areas where the liquid entered. Do not use a wet cloth, as this can cause further damage.

4. Dry the MacBook Pro

Next, you need to dry your MacBook Pro. You can use a hairdryer or a fan to speed up the process, but be sure to keep the device at a safe distance. Do not use a heat gun, as it can cause further damage. Keep the MacBook Pro in a well-ventilated area and leave it to dry for at least 24 hours.

5. Bring your MacBook Pro to a professional

If your MacBook Pro still doesn't turn on after 24 hours, it's time to bring it to a professional. Do not attempt to open or repair your MacBook Pro yourself, as it may lead to more damage. A professional repair service can assess the damage and provide an estimate for repairs.

Conclusion

In conclusion, spills happen, and when they do, don't panic. Stay calm and follow these steps to help save your MacBook Pro from liquid damage. Remember, prevention is always the best course of action, so be careful and avoid bringing liquid near your MacBook Pro to begin with.  If your MacBook Pro is beyond saving, it might be time to invest in a new one. However, following these steps can help prevent liquid spills and prolong the life of your MacBook Pro.

## Chosen Solution
 A friend of mine brought me his Early 2015 Retina MB Pro 13" after his youngest child spilled juice on the keyboard. The computer did work afterwards but he was having some charging issues. When I got it, the computer would not power on, it would give the "Plug in AC Adapter" symbol. Okay so I plugged it in, and hitting the power button gives me the "Low Battery symbol". Removed the bottom cover and inspected, there actually wasn't much corrosion, other than a small spot on the logic board, and (after removing the flash memory) some on the SSD connector. Cleaned all visible corrosion with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol, took the MagSafe port out and cleaned it to remove debris and any possible corrosion. Put it back together (didn't reinstall bottom cover) and it powered on. SWEET! I was only able to login to the Guest account, therefore I could not do any diagnostics due to the restrictions. Shut it down so I could login to the Admin account (after I got the password) and it wouldn't turn back on.
I've tried unplugging the battery from the logic board to power it on, nothing. MagSafe LED is illuminated with the amber light, and when I do the SMC Reset key combo, it goes green, then back to amber.
I am going to pull the logic board out to see if there may be some corrosion on the other side of the board, but does anyone have any other suggestions? Will post pictures as well.
Pictures:

 Might need to replace to battery, i see corrosion on the logic board, i would give it an alcohol bath over night and gently brush it good the next morning when waking up, also check to see if there's corrosion on the battery connector itself,

 To have any chance at a lasting repair the logic board itself will need cleaned with an quality ultrasonic cleaner. Alcohol and a tooth brush may work temporally but will fail in time.  If you can't get it to power on I would also be leaning towards the keyboard is bad as well from the liquid spill, there are ways to short pins on the board to force it to turn on & bypass the keyboard to confirm that, that is the direction I would go.

 Purchased a logic board from ifixit, installed it and runs perfect now! Saved a couple hundred bucks by doing it in house instead of sending the laptop to a repair shop! Thanks for the help everyone!
SN: Does anyone know if the old logic board is worth selling? Or worth sending to somebody with an Ultrasonic cleaner and reselling once repaired?
