Title: Instagram vs Snapchat: Top 5 Reasons You Need to Ditch Snaps and Switch to Insta for Good!

Introduction:

Social media platforms have become an essential part of our daily lives, allowing users to capture, share and explore the world around them. Among the most popular of these platforms are Snapchat and Instagram. While both offer their unique features, the recent rise of Instagram has made it a popular platform of choice for many. With that said, here are the top five reasons why you should ditch Snapchat and switch to Instagram for good!

1. Instagram Story Features:

One of Instagram's top features is the Instagram story. Instagram Stories allow individuals to share what's happening in their daily lives in real-time. The app's advanced features, including photo editing, filters, text overlay, boomerangs, and superzoom, give Instagram an edge over its competitors. Not only that, but Instagram stories also provide users with the ability to go live and stream video content, including event coverage, Q&A with fans, and behind-the-scenes access.

2. Greater User Base:

Instagram has a greater user base than Snapchat, with over one billion monthly active users. This means Instagram offers you greater potential for reach and engagement, making it the perfect platform for businesses and influencers to reach a wider audience. With Instagram users of all age groups, Instagram offers a much more diverse audience base than Snapchat.

3. Less Cluttered User Interface:

Snapchat's user interface is cluttered with various features and tabs, making it difficult to navigate. Instagram, on the other hand, has a much cleaner and less cluttered interface, making it easier for users to find what they want. Instagram's design ensures that users can focus on what's important: the content.

4. Better Hashtag Management:

Instagram allows users to follow hashtags, making it easier for users to find content relevant to their interests. Additionally, Instagram's algorithm is customizable to individual users, making its suggested content more conducive to curated interests. Snapchat, on the other hand, lacks key features that make it easier for users to follow their interests or find relevant content.

5. Advertisements:

Instagram offers better advertisement features when compared to Snapchat. Its platform allows for more ad space, better targeting options, and integration with Facebook's advanced ad campaign management tools. For advertisers, Instagram offers them the ability to reach a wider audience, while providing tools that enable them to monitor their campaigns closely.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Instagram offers better features, more diverse audiences, a cleaner interface, better hashtag management, and better advertising abilities. These reasons make it the better platform when compared to Snapchat. Instagram offers users a better and more comprehensive social media experience, making it the social media platform of choice for many. So, ditch Snapchat and switch over to Instagram for good!

Instagram and Snapchat are two major social media accounts which have surely become our go-to place (and of course Facebook too). Although both these accounts have an entirely different approach yet they are still alike in some way. The recent update of Snapchat has really made a lot of users quite upset, and the company has faced losses as well due to that. A lot of users are now finding Snapchat’s interface confusing, and thus rarely use the app anymore.
 
On the other hand, Instagram is constantly upgrading to improve user experience. From stories to filters to news feed, Instagram offers many features under one roof.
 
So, is Snapchat losing its game? Seems like the puppy face filters and dancing hot dog are no more spreading their charm on users. Let’s discuss a few reasons which make Instagram a way better app than Snapchat.
 
### 1. A Pleasant Interface
 

 
As compared to Snapchat, Instagram is surely one beautiful smooth-looking app. And of course a lot of people aren’t much happy with Snapchat’s new interface, especially the all new “Discover” section which is hardly used by users. This major overhaul in Snapchat’s design has surely been a big disappointment. On the other hand, Instagram interface has kept everything pretty sorted with Stories section on top, Direct messages button on the right and a scrolling news feed which keeps us glued to the application all day long.
 
### 2. Snapchat is Confused
 
What is Snapchat actually trying to be? Don’t you think the app’s interface is quite confusing? What is it basically, a messaging place or a news and video platform? Yes, the disappearing messages were surely the original hook of this application but well, not any more. Talking about Instagram, yes we certainly do believe that it has somehow stolen the Stories feature of Snapchat but it is all forgiven as the application has become so much better over time.
 
### 3. Lesser Ads on Instagram
 
Social media is like a giant ocean where marketers leave no chance to target the right audience. Well, a good thing about Instagram is that brands and advertisement stay in a certain parameter and don’t invade our privacy. Unlike Snapchat, which offers a pushier approach when it comes to brand and advertisement, dealing marketers on Instagram is much easier.
 
### 4. Following is Easier on Instagram
 
Believe it or not but exploring new places, finding and following new people is easier on Instagram. Whereas in Snapchat you can only follow a bunch of people whose username you have and this certainly restricts the number of followers we have.
 
### 5. More Number of Followers on Instagram
 
If talking about of stats, the number of active users on Instagram is almost double of Snapchat. From teenagers to adults to professionals to bloggers, Instagram is the go-to application for all set of people irrespective of their age or profession. Whereas, Snapchat is more like a fun app which is often used to interact with our bunch of crazy friends.
 
So folks, here were a few reasons why we find Instagram a lot better than Snapchat. What’s your say? Do you agree with us? Do share your feedback in the comments box below!
