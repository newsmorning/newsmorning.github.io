Title: You Won't Believe Why Your iPhone 4 Can't Charge with This Accessory! Find Out Now.

Introduction: 

iPhones have been around for over a decade and have grown to become an essential part of modern living. With each iteration, they bring new features, better performance, and sleeker designs. However, as technology progresses, old accessories may not keep up. 

Have you ever tried to charge your iPhone 4 with a third-party accessory only to find it not charging? It's frustrating, right? But don't worry, there's a good reason why it's happening.

The Reason: 

The iPhone 4 was released in 2010 and uses the 30-pin connector. This connector is proprietary to Apple, meaning that only Apple or Apple-authorized accessories can use it. Third-party accessories that use this 30-pin connector have to be authorized by Apple through the Made for iPod/iPhone/iPad (MFi) program.

However, some third-party accessory manufacturers circumvent the MFi program, resulting in accessories that may not work with your iPhone 4. The MFi program enables accessory manufacturers to access technical information to make sure their accessories are compatible with Apple devices.

When you use third-party accessories that are not MFi-certified, the accessory may not be able to provide the necessary power to charge your iPhone 4. This can result in slow charging or not charging at all. 

What to Do: 

If you're having trouble charging your iPhone 4 with a third-party accessory, there are a few things you can do.

First, try using a different Apple-certified accessory. This can help identify whether the issue is with the accessory or with your iPhone 4.

Secondly, check the MFi certification on the accessory before purchasing. Look for the logo on the packaging or the accessory itself. If you're unsure, you can check the MFi program's website to see if the accessory is certified.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, using third-party accessories can be a great way to save money or get more specialized features. However, it's essential to ensure that the accessory you're using is MFi-certified to avoid any compatibility issues. So, if you're having trouble charging your iPhone 4 with a third-party accessory, try switching to an Apple-certified option or ensure that the accessory is MFi-certified before purchasing.

## Chosen Solution
 My iphone 4 started giving me this error message. Following the instructions given in other questions, I started by cleaning dock. I then replaced battery, no difference. I then replaced dock connector, still same error message. I don't know what to do next.

 DANETERRELL3the usual way to dela with that is by
1.try other USB cable,or charger.
2.Replace dock flex connector.
3.Reball/Replace PMIC.
Anything after that could be turning into a board level repair, due to failed SMD components, like the diodes. Hope this helps, good luck.

 I am having problems with my iphone as well. It kkeeps saying charging is not supported with this device. I have tried restoring it and a lot of other methods online. I also read that it could be the dock connector. I was just wondering if anyone knew any other methods to make this go away before i buy a new dock connector. Any input would be greatly appreciated thanks sandy.
