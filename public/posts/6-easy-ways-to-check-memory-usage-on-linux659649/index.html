Do you wonder if your memory is being used properly? Monitoring your memory usage can help you identify issues that could be affecting your system’s performance. In this article, we will show you six simple tricks you can use to monitor your Linux memory.\nTrick 1: Using the “free” Command The “free” command is a built-in tool in Linux that displays the memory usage of your system. Running the command without any arguments retrieves the total memory, the used memory, and free memory on your system.\n$ free\rtotal used free shared buff/cache available\rMem: 16239232 8967396 1212264 1057608 6061572 6460096\rSwap: 0 0 0 Here you can see the total memory, which is 16GB, and the used memory, which is 8.9GB. The remaining memory is shared, cache, and available.\nTrick 2: Using the “top” Command The “top” command shows you the processes running in your system and how much memory each process is consuming. By default, the processes are sorted by their CPU usage, but you can change the sorting by pressing the “M” key.\n$ top Here you can see a graphical interface showing you the processes running on your system and their memory usage.\nTrick 3: Using the “htop” Command Similar to the “top” command, “htop” displays the processes running on your system and their memory usage. However, “htop” is more interactive and user-friendly than “top.” It provides a colorful graphical interface that is easy to read.\n$ htop Here is an example of the “htop” interface. You can see the memory usage of each process in real-time.\nTrick 4: Using the “ps” Command The “ps” command is another built-in tool that displays the running processes on your system. With the “ps” command, you can see the memory usage of each process by using the “-o” option and specifying the “rss” or “vsz” flag. The “rss” flag shows you the Resident Set Size (RSS) memory usage, which is the non-swapped physical memory used by a process, while the “vsz” flag shows you the Virtual Memory Size (VMS) usage, which is the total amount of virtual memory used by a process.\n$ ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 11 This command will show you the top 10 processes consuming memory.\nTrick 5: Using the “vmstat” Command The “vmstat” command shows you the virtual memory statistics of your system. By default, it shows you the virtual memory usage in kilobytes, but you can also use the “-t” flag to show the time stamp for each line.\n$ vmstat Trick 6: Using the “sar” Command The “sar” command is a system activity reporter that shows you the CPU, memory, and other system statistics in a readable format. You can use the “sar” command to monitor the memory usage of your system over time by setting an interval and a count.\n$ sar -r 1 10 This command will display the memory usage of your system every second for ten seconds.\nIn conclusion, monitoring your memory usage in Linux is vital to keep your system running smoothly. With these six easy tricks, you can easily monitor the memory usage of your system and identify problems that could be affecting your system’s performance. So, monitor your memory usage today, and keep your system running at its best!\nLinux comes with a lot of built-in tools for administering and optimizing your system. If you’re new to Linux or just recently made the switch from Windows, you need to learn a number of commands to get the most from it. Linux is mostly famous for being an operating system where the user or administrator has full control. Whether you use Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, or any other Linux distribution, you can do anything with the right commands and tools.\nIn this article, we’re going to focus on how to check memory usage on Linux because this is an important skill to have. Sometimes apps will start hogging all the system memory and you’ll need to know the troubleshooting steps you need to take to find the issue. So here are the best command-line tools to check memory usage on your Linux system.\n1. The “top” Command The top command-line tool will give you a summary of all the running processes. This summary includes real-time information on memory usage, so you can use it as a monitoring app as well. You can see how much of your system memory is used in total and then you can go through the list of processes to check how much of that memory is used by every process.\nTo run this tool, simply type the top command:\n$ top\nThe top command shows you your Linux system’s total and free amount of memory as well as the used physical and swap memory. The most important column, in this case, is %MEM because it tells you how much physical memory each process used. Then you can identify the rogue app that’s eating too much memory and kill it.\nAlso, you can use the top command-line tool to check the CPU usage. Just check the %CPU column to see how much processing power is used by each app.\n2. The “free” Command If all you need to learn about your system’s memory usage is the amount of free and used memory, you don’t really need the top command. The free command will be enough. Type free in the terminal and instantly learn how much physical and swap memory is free or used. At the same time, you get information about the buffers that the kernel uses.\nKeep in mind that the memory usage information doesn’t appear in real-time. You can use the free command line to monitor memory usage. Essentially, this is a screenshot that tells you how much memory was free or used when you typed the command. Use the top command if you want to monitor memory usage or to learn how much memory each process uses.\n3. The “htop” Command The htop command is basically the top command tool with an easier-to-read environment and user-friendly controls. It outputs RAM usage in real-time, gives you a list of all the running processes, and it gives you shortcuts to commands that control the processes. Once you see the process that eats up too much RAM, you can press the shortcut key to kill it instead of using Bash commands.\nTo use the htop command, you need to type htop in the terminal. That said, you might get an error if your Linux distribution doesn’t come with this tool by default. In that case, type the following command to install it:\n$ sudo apt-get install htop\n4. The “vmstat” Command The vmstat command will display the virtual memory statistics report. The command will give you more information than you probably need, but if you’re planning to become a Linux system admin, you should know it. The report includes the following information:\nThe number of processes (procs) that way for run time.The amount of swapped memory, free memory, cache, and buffers.Blocks received and sent to a block device (IO).CPU times (user time, system time, idle time). Type vmstat in the terminal to get the virtual memory statistics report.\n5. Check the “proc/meminfo” File You’re probably wondering where your Linux system gets all these reports and information on RAM usage. Well, pretty much all of the command line tools you used so far have the same source: the proc/meminfo virtual file. If you want to go directly to the source and get all the memory usage information you want, you can easily access the file by typing the following command:\nless /proc/meminfo\nThe report is quite long, so you should use the less command to get some navigation control to quickly scan through the output for the data you need. That said, this detailed report contains a lot of information you probably don’t need. So here are the most important values you should focus on:\nMemTotalMemFreeMemAvailableBuffersCachedSwapCachedSwapTotalSwapFree 6. Use the GUI Linux purists might be against using the GUI over command line tools, but having a visual representation of RAM usage is great. You can get all the information you need and monitor your system’s memory usage in real-time by using the Linux System Monitor app.\nTo use the app, type “System Monitor” in the start menu’s search bar and press Enter. The System Monitor has two tabs we’re interested in: the Processes and Resources tabs.\nIn the Processes tab, you can see all the processes that are currently running on your Linux operating system. You can read memory usage, CPU usage, and other data for each individual process. This is where you can learn if one of the apps has gone rogue and is using way too much RAM. Then you can kill the process from the same window by right-clicking on it and selecting the kill option.\nThat said, if all you need is to learn how your system memory and CPU have been behaving, you should check out the graphical visualization in the Resources tab.\nHere you can see the CPU, RAM, and network history as a graph. This means you get historical data on your system’s memory usage over a certain period of time and you can also monitor that usage in real-time. How do you prefer to check memory usage on your Linux operating system? Do you know other commands and tools that can get more valuable data for analysis?

The command will give you more information than you probably need, but if you’re planning to become a Linux system admin, you should know it. The report includes the following information:</p><ul><li>The number of processes (procs) that way for run time.The amount of swapped memory, free memory, cache, and buffers.Blocks received and sent to a block device (IO).CPU times (user time, system time, idle time).</li></ul><p>Type vmstat in the terminal to get the virtual memory statistics report.</p><h2 id=5-check-the-procmeminfo-file>5. Check the “proc/meminfo” File<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-check-the-procmeminfo-file>#</a></h2><p>You’re probably wondering where your Linux system gets all these reports and information on RAM usage. Well, pretty much all of the command line tools you used so far have the same source: the proc/meminfo virtual file. If you want to go directly to the source and get all the memory usage information you want, you can easily access the file by typing the following command:</p><p>less /proc/meminfo</p><p>The report is quite long, so you should use the less command to get some navigation control to quickly scan through the output for the data you need. That said, this detailed report contains a lot of information you probably don’t need. So here are the most important values you should focus on:</p><ul><li>MemTotalMemFreeMemAvailableBuffersCachedSwapCachedSwapTotalSwapFree</li></ul><h2 id=6-use-the-gui>6. Use the GUI<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-use-the-gui>#</a></h2><p>Linux purists might be against using the GUI over command line tools, but having a visual representation of RAM usage is great. You can get all the information you need and monitor your system’s memory usage in real-time by using the Linux System Monitor app.</p><p>To use the app, type “System Monitor” in the start menu’s search bar and press Enter. The System Monitor has two tabs we’re interested in: the Processes and Resources tabs.</p><p>In the Processes tab, you can see all the processes that are currently running on your Linux operating system. You can read memory usage, CPU usage, and other data for each individual process. This is where you can learn if one of the apps has gone rogue and is using way too much RAM. Then you can kill the process from the same window by right-clicking on it and selecting the kill option.</p><p>That said, if all you need is to learn how your system memory and CPU have been behaving, you should check out the graphical visualization in the Resources tab.</p><p>Here you can see the CPU, RAM, and network history as a graph. This means you get historical data on your system’s memory usage over a certain period of time and you can also monitor that usage in real-time. </p><p>How do you prefer to check memory usage on your Linux operating system? Do you know other commands and tools that can get more valuable data for analysis?
