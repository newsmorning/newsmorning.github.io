If you are an iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi user, there is a serious problem that you need to address right away. Your device's Lightning jack may be broken, and this can cause serious issues with charging, data transfer, and other functions. Here's what you need to do right now to address this problem and get your iPad back to full functionality. 

Step 1: Check for Physical Damage 

The first thing you need to do is check for physical damage to the Lightning jack. Look closely at the jack and see if you can spot any cracks, chipping, or other damage. If you can, then the problem is likely with the hardware, and you will need to have it repaired. 

Step 2: Try Cleaning the Jack 

If there is no visible physical damage, then the problem may be with dirt, dust, or other debris clogging the jack. This is a common issue with Lightning jacks, and it can cause all sorts of problems with charging and data transfer. Try cleaning the jack with a soft brush or compressed air, and see if that helps. 

Step 3: Check Your Charger 

Sometimes, the problem isn't with the iPad itself, but with the charger you are using. Try using a different charger, preferably an Apple authorized charger, and see if that resolves the issue. 

Step 4: Take It to a Professional 

If none of these steps work, then it is time to take your iPad to a professional repair shop. They will be able to diagnose the problem and offer you a solution. Depending on the severity of the problem, they may need to replace the Lightning jack altogether, or they may be able to repair it. 

In conclusion, a broken Lightning jack can cause some serious issues with your iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi, but it is a problem that can be fixed with a little effort. If you follow these steps and take your device to a professional if needed, you will be back to using your iPad in no time. Don't wait to address the problem, as it can only get worse over time.

## Chosen Solution
 My iPad Air 2 is not charging. Iâ€™ve tried restarting the device, cleaning out the lighting port, changing cords, chargers, and wall outlets to no avail. I was looking for other ideas as tot he cause, or for a replacement part to replace the defective part.

 Unfortunately, your port may be defective. It is soldered to the Logic Board and would require micro-soldering to be replaced. If you want to repair it, it may be cheaper to take it to Apple, as micro-soldering can be very expensive.

 You can buy a replacement charging dock voor the ipad air 2 it isnt that hard to repair no soldering needed , buy one with flex cable.
