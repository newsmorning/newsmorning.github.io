# You Won't Believe The Life-Changing Trick To Perfectly Adjust Your Hyundai Elantra's Driver Side Mirror!

Driving a car is an essential part of modern life, and it's no secret that owning a car comes with a lot of responsibilities. One of the most crucial things to consider is your safety while driving. And one of the most important factors in driving safely is having properly adjusted mirrors; specifically, the driver-side mirror. 

The driver side-mirror is often used to check behind the car and monitor the speed and the distance of the other cars on the road. One of the most common problems of adjusting the driver-side mirror is setting it at the right angle to give a broader view of the road. It can be frustrating to keep adjusting it back and forth while driving, and finding that the blind spot not adequately covered. Lucky for you, however, there's a simple and life-changing trick to perfectly adjust your Hyundai Elantra's driver-side mirror that will save you from the headache of guessing the right angle.

First off, position yourself comfortably in the driver's seat and adjust the side mirror according to Hyundai Elantra's manual guide to the factory setting. That would mean the mirror is angled to provide a view of the side of the car and not much of the road behind. The first step is to adjust the driver's seat position so that your shoulder is in line with the driver-side mirror. This means your seating position will lean slightly away from the driver's door so that you will be able to see what the mirror doesn’t.

The second step is to lean your head to the left until it touches the side window, while keeping your shoulder within range of the driver-side mirror. The position will give you an overlapping view with the driver-side mirror, giving you a broad view of the road behind and covering the blind spot. 

By fine-tuning the side mirror following these simple steps, you can have a better view of the surroundings and drive with more confidence. You know what they say – seeing is believing!

In conclusion, adjusting the driver's side mirror can sometimes be a tricky task. But with this life-changing trick to perfectly adjust your Hyundai Elantra's driver-side mirror, you can drive with better visibility, avoid potential accidents, and feel more confident on the road. Be sure to try this trick next time you adjust your car mirrors!

## Chosen Solution
 I just bought a 2018 Elantra and am having a problem adjusting the outside mirror on the driver's side.  I can adjust it to go up, down and to the right, but I can't move it to the left as much as I need to.  The passenger's side mirror is fine.

 Should be under warranty. Take it to the dealership.
