This Insane Glitch is Preventing You from Performing a Hard Reset on Your ZTE Lever - Here's How to Fix It!

The ZTE Lever is a popular smartphone that offers a powerful performance and a sleek design. However, it is not immune to certain glitches that can make it challenging to use, and one such problem is the inability to perform a hard reset. A hard reset is a valuable tool that helps you tackle critical issues like phone freezes, software malfunctions, and other problems. Unfortunately, many ZTE Lever users have been experiencing an insane glitch that prevents them from doing a hard reset. If you're looking for a solution on how to fix it, then you're in the right place.

The Insane Glitch

The problem with the ZTE Lever lies in the recovery mode. When you attempt to perform a hard reset, the recovery mode kicks in, but it gets stuck in a loop where it keeps displaying the Android logo. This situation renders the hard reset feature useless, and it can be frustrating, especially when you desperately need to reset your phone.

The Fix

Thankfully, there's a way to get past this insane glitch and successfully perform a hard reset on your ZTE Lever. The solution lies in accessing the recovery mode manually by following these simple steps:

1. Power off your ZTE Lever.

2. Once it's off, press and hold the volume up button, the power button, and the home button simultaneously.

3. Keep holding the buttons until you see the Android logo appear on the screen.

4. Release the buttons and wait for a few seconds for the recovery mode to appear.

5. Once the recovery mode shows up, scroll down using the volume down button to the "Wipe Data/Factory Reset" option.

6. Press the power button to select the option.

7. Confirm the operation by selecting "Yes - Wipe all data."

8. Wait for the process to complete, and your ZTE Lever should now be reset to its factory settings.

Conclusion

The insane glitch that prevents you from performing a hard reset on your ZTE Lever can be a frustrating experience, but with the steps outlined above, you'll be able to bypass it and reset your phone to its default settings. Remember, a hard reset is a powerful tool that helps to fix software problems, so don't hesitate to use it when your phone is acting up.

## Chosen Solution
 My phone synced did a factory reset but it will not let me finish the set up its stuck on google account verify. It says that it has to be an account that was previously synced on the device... I only have one Google account but when I enter in the address and password it goes back to the same screen,,,, what do I do

 you are probably running android 5.1 on it and it has entered factory reset protection (FRP). There is a way to get back into it but it is a lengthy process. first off there are two ways to do a factory reset. 1 the key combo reset and 2 the backup and reset setting menu. the key combo one does not erase everything it actully still saves the users email address and password and wont let you get back on it unless you input the correct username and password. you need the second one with the security menu. to get here you need to start the log in process but do not type in your email hold down the , button on your keyboard and you should see a setting icon appear go to that you will see a window pop open go to the one below languages. now you need to get to a help section it doesn't matter which one as long as there is a lot of text that you can hold on and get to the share menu don't click on share click on the search icon (the magnifying glass) and type in settings you should see settings appear click on that. once you are in the setting go to backup and reset and click on factory data reset. wait for it to reset and you should be able to set it up like its a new phone. make sure your phone is fully charged before this process. this process is a little different on all phones. I am not responsible for any damages that may occur during this process.
