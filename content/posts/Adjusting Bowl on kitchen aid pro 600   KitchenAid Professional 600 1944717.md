You've Been Making This Huge Mistake With Your Kitchen Aid Pro 600 - Here's The Correct Way To Adjust Its Bowl!

Are you tired of your Kitchen Aid Pro 600 mixer creating a mess every time you use it? Do you find yourself constantly stopping and adjusting the position of the bowl? If so, there's a good chance that you've been making a huge mistake with your mixer - adjusting its bowl incorrectly.

The Kitchen Aid Pro 600 mixer, just like any other mixer, needs proper adjustment to work efficiently. However, many people fail to understand the correct way to adjust its bowl, leading to frustration and sub-par performance. But don't worry; we've got you covered. Here's the correct way to adjust your Kitchen Aid Pro 600 mixer's bowl for optimal performance.

Step 1: Position the mixer on a flat surface

Before adjusting the bowl, it's important to place the mixer on a flat surface. This ensures that the bowl sits correctly and prevents it from wobbling during use. If the surface is uneven, the base of the mixer won't sit flush on it, causing stability issues.

Step 2: Turn clockwise

The next step is to turn the bowl clockwise to tighten it. To do this, insert the bowl onto the base and gently turn it to the right until it clicks into place. Make sure you turn the bowl until it stops moving, or else it won't be properly secured.

Step 3: Adjust the height

Once the bowl is in position, you might want to adjust its height to ensure that it's close enough to the attachments for efficient mixing. First, unplug the mixer for safety, then look for two screws on the side of the mixer head. Turning these screws adjusts the height of the bowl.

To adjust the height, turn the screws counterclockwise to lower the bowl or clockwise to raise it. Be sure to turn the screws the same number of times on both sides to maintain balance. Once you're satisfied with the height, plug the mixer back in and you're ready to use it.

Step 4: Check for stability

Finally, check to ensure the bowl is stable by gently touching it. If it wobbles, it means that it's not properly adjusted. You can fix this issue by tightening the bowl and readjusting its height.

In conclusion, adjusting the bowl of your Kitchen Aid Pro 600 mixer is essential to get the best results from it. Make sure you follow the steps outlined above, and you'll be on your way to hassle-free mixing. Remember, a well-adjusted mixer is a happy mixer.

## Chosen Solution
 Tried the "dime test" and still cannot adjust beater down as set screw will not move any further right.

 I had this problem too.  All the videos say to adjust th screw 1/4 turn to the  right to lower the beater until it barely moves a dime 1/2" with each pass of the beater.
I figured out if turn screw to the right as instructed, it made the dime test worse. The screw barely turned an 1/8th of a turn and wouldn't turn any further. So I turned the screw to the LEFT a little at a time... and ta-dah. Dime test passed. :)

 My adjustment screw turns to either 3 o’clock or 9 o’clock and neither way makes any movement up or down with my beater. It still won’t come towards the bottom of the bowl. The time doesn’t move!

 So I’ve had a bowl clearance issue after accidentally dropping a half cup measure in. I noticed there’s some play in the bracket that holds the “arms” that hold the bowl. I stuffed some paper behind that bracket and it holds it more up, enough to pass the dime test.
