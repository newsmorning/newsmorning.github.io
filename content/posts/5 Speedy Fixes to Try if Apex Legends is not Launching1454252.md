# Sick of Apex Legends not launching? Try these 5 speedy fixes and dominate the game!

Are you tired of your Apex Legends game not launching? It can be frustrating to spend hours trying to get the game to work, only to have it crash or freeze on you. But don’t worry, there are several quick and easy fixes that will have you back in the game and dominating the competition in no time!

## Fix 1: Check Your System Requirements

The first thing you should do is check your system requirements to make sure that your PC or console meets the minimum requirements for Apex Legends. Apex Legends requires a 64-bit operating system, at least 6GB of RAM, and a DirectX 11 compatible video card. If your system does not meet these requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware or software before you can play Apex Legends.

## Fix 2: Update Your Graphics Card Drivers

If your graphics card drivers are outdated, this can cause issues with launching Apex Legends. To update your graphics card drivers, visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer and download the latest drivers for your card. Once you have downloaded and installed the new drivers, restart your computer and try launching Apex Legends again.

## Fix 3: Verify Your Game Files

Sometimes, game files can become corrupted or missing, which can prevent Apex Legends from launching. To verify your game files, go to the game library in your respective gaming platform, right click on Apex Legends, select “properties,” and then click on “verify game files.” This process will check for any missing or corrupted files and replace them if necessary.

## Fix 4: Disable Your Anti-Virus Software

Your anti-virus software can sometimes flag Apex Legends as a potential threat and prevent it from launching. Try disabling your anti-virus software temporarily and see if the game launches. If it does, you can add Apex Legends to your anti-virus software’s exceptions list to prevent it from being flagged as a threat in the future.

## Fix 5: Run the Game as Administrator

Sometimes, running Apex Legends as an administrator can help with launching issues. To do this, right click on the game icon and select “run as administrator.” This will give the game access to administrative privileges that may be necessary for it to launch.

With these 5 quick and easy fixes, you should be able to get your Apex Legends game up and running again. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the game, you’ll be able to dominate the competition in no time. So what are you waiting for? Get back in the game and start taking down your enemies today!
