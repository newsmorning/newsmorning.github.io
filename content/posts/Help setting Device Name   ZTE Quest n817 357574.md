## Chosen Solution
 Is there any option to set then ZTE Quest’s Device Name so that it does not show up on a network unidentified? or only identified by a MAC address?

 Hi @thefuneralhost ,
Don’t know if this is available on your model or not but try going to Settings app > enable Bluetooth > when enabled, tap the right hand soft key below the screen to get BT settings menu and check if there is an option to rename phone.
Apologies if you have tried this already.
