Stuck in Silence: Discover the Shocking Reason Why Your Clarion CD Player Won't Load or Eject in Your 2005 Subaru Impreza!

If you're a car enthusiast, then you know the importance of having a functioning sound system in your vehicle. One crucial aspect of an exceptional in-car audio experience is having a reliable CD player. However, nothing is more frustrating than when your CD player suddenly stops working or won't load or eject your favorite album. If this sounds like you, you're not alone. Many 2005 Subaru Impreza owners have experienced this problem with their Clarion CD player, and it all stems from a faulty mechanism.

Identifying the Problem

If you're experiencing issues with your Clarion CD player in your 2005 Subaru Impreza, then you most likely have a carousel that's not rotating correctly. The carousel is responsible for holding your CDs and rotating them, so they're in the correct position for play or eject.

Without the carousel functioning as it should, users will experience a dead silent CD player - one that won't load or eject any CDs at all. Therefore, the issue isn't with the CD itself, but rather a physical aspect of the player.

Solving the Problem

The first step toward solving this problem is identifying the culprit, but once you know it's the carousel, you have several options. One option is to replace the faulty part with an entirely new one, which will undoubtedly solve your problem. However, this solution can be expensive and time-consuming to do.

On the other hand, you can attempt to rectify the situation yourself by cleaning and lubricating the existing mechanism. The car's CD player tends to collect dust and debris over time, causing the function to break down. Regular cleaning and lubrication can extend the lifespan of the unit and fix minor issues before they develop further.

To try this at home, get hold of a lubricant that's safe for electronics, like silicone spray or WD-40. Begin by carefully removing the faceplate of your CD player and locate the mechanism within. Once you've found it, apply lubrication liberally, rotating and spreading it evenly. Any dust or debris will be dislodged as you do this. After that, take a blank CD and load it into the tray. Allow it to play for about ten seconds, and then eject it. Repeat the process three to four times, and then test the CD player with some of your favorite albums. If all goes well, the CD player will function as expected, and your favorite albums will be jamming once more.

Conclusion

A faulty mechanism can derail any in-car audio experience, and it's essential to keep your CD player in perfect working condition. However, with this knowledge under your belt, you can clean and maintain your Clarion CD player. Remember, when your CD player won't load or eject in your 2005 Subaru Impreza, it's most likely the carousel mechanism. But with some at-home care and maintenance, you can extend the life of your unit and get back to enjoying your music on your drives.


## Chosen Solution
 A CD got stuck in the player even though it loaded fine and was playing. I managed to extract the CD with sticky tape attached to a shim, but something must be out of alignment now as the player won't load or eject and I hear a ratcheting noise as it attempts to work. Radio still works fine.  Removed the fuse and reinstalled after 20+ mins. but still won't load.  Everyone says "just get a new one" but I really like the one that came with the car (it matches the dash and doesn't have a lot of juvenile flashing lights and graphics). All local car audio stores only remove and install. It seems crazy to just discard it and buy another when I feel sure that it's fixable if I just could find someone to fix it without costing a ridiculous amount. Haven't tried forcing another CD in to see if that works, in case it gets stuck again and I can't get that one out. Any thoughts?

 Unfortunately I do not have a solution, but I do agree with Laurie. I rather have the original radio as it is far more user friendly than aftermarket and looks right for the car. Out of desparation  after trying to repair the original myself, I got one from a used part dealer (auto salvage yard).

 Happened to me. I stuck a bank card in it at the top of the cd and it seems to unhook a broken latch of some sort

 Thanks.  I tried that and it didn't work.  What did work was wrapping packing tape, sticky-side out, around a very thin shim and sliding it in the slot, tapping the top of the CD, then carefully drawing it out.  But, unfortunately, the CD player was broken, which is possibly why it jammed in the first place.  (Either that or a well-meaning, ham-fisted friend's efforts, poking some plastic implement around in there.)
Turns out there's an itty-bitty gear in the back on both (I think) ends of a roller that controls the player's ejection and loading functions.  It's common for a hairline crack to develop in a gear over time, which means the 2 ends of the roller move at different phases, keeping the CD from ejecting.  Watched a YouTube where a guy fixed it . . . by making his own new gears!   No one sells them.  And it was really fiddly repair, with tiny parts and springs just poised to poing all over the place.  So I gave up.  But I did get the CD out (it was trashed).

 Mine was stuck on eject with no cd in it. I put a business card in halfway and it fixed the problem.
