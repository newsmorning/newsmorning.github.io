Introduction

Have you ever experienced turning off the lights at home and noticing that your fridge suddenly goes dim? It might come off as an odd occurrence, but there's actually a surprising reason behind it. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what causes this phenomenon and what it means for your household appliances.

The Culprit: Voltage Drop

The reason behind the dimming lights and fridge is a voltage drop. Voltage is the amount of electrical potential energy that flows through the electrical system to power your appliances. When the voltage drops, it means that there's less energy reaching your appliances, which in turn affects their performance.

One of the reasons voltage drops occur is because of high electrical demand. When you turn on multiple appliances such as your air conditioning, washing machines, or any high-powered appliance, they draw a lot of electricity. This causes the voltage in the electrical system to decrease, resulting in your appliances, including your fridge, to perform poorly or momentarily turn off.

The Effects of Voltage Drop on Your Appliances

Having a voltage drop in your home's electrical system can impact your appliances in various ways. Suppose you turn on several appliances at once that demand more electrical power. In that case, you'll experience a fluctuation in the voltage, causing your lights to dim, and your fridge to operate at low power, leading to food spoilage.

Similarly, having an underpowered or an overused extension cord can also cause voltage drop, leading to your electronics shutting off unexpectedly, or your lights flickering.

How to Avoid Voltage Drops

If you experience voltage drops regularly, here are a few ways you can avoid them and protect your grid:

1. Limit the use of high-powered appliances simultaneously.

Suppose you're using an air conditioner, washing machine, or any appliance that demands high electrical power. In that case, it's best to avoid using them all at once. Try to stagger the use of high-powered appliances to reduce the voltage drop.

2. Check your extension cords.

Make sure your extensions cords aren't underpowered, and they can handle the electrical demand of your appliances. It's also best to avoid daisy-chaining extension cords or having too many appliances plugged into one extension cord.

3. Get a Voltage Stabilizer.

A voltage stabilizer can help regulate the voltage in your home's electrical system, keeping your appliances running effectively and minimizing the chances of voltage drops. Additionally, you can get a voltage regulator that will monitor and maintain the voltage between 220V-230V, ensuring that your appliances receive a steady supply of electrical power.

Conclusion

In conclusion, voltage drop is the primary cause behind the dimming lights and the underperforming fridge in your home. The fluctuation in the electrical grid can not only lead to appliance malfunctions but also affect your food's quality and safety. By following the steps mentioned above and taking precautions, you can protect your appliances and minimize voltage drops, leading to a safer and more efficient electrical system in your home.

## Chosen Solution
 Had same problem with Model WRF990SLAM02.
Now lights on 1   1/2 are out, ant the other side are dim.
How would I find out if there has been a recall?
Any other ideas  would be helpful.

 The manual is here.  Have you replaced the bulbs before?

I've had to replace bulbs on many different models of refrigerators.   Perhaps the bulbs are just poor quality?
