TITLE: SHOCKING: iPhone 7's Replacement Screen Has a Secret 'Lighter Spot' – Is Your Phone at Risk?!

Introduction:
The iPhone 7 is one of the most popular smartphones in the market, with several users opting for it over other alternatives. However, recent developments have highlighted a concerning issue that may have affected a large number of iPhone 7 owners. Reports have emerged that the replacement screens used in repairing an iPhone 7’s display might have a ‘lighter spot.’ The spot is a small area that is lighter in color than the rest of the screen, which could make it stand out and compromise the device's appearance. The implication of the issue is potentially severe, causing widespread concern, and prompting an abundance of questions regarding the issue's nature and scope.

Issue Causes:
A lighter spot on an iPhone 7 replacement screen is thought to have arisen from a setting modification made by Apple in the phone's hardware architecture. In a bid to improve the functioning of '3D Touch' and facilitate the technology's integration into the screen assembly component of the iPhone 7, Apple lightened a tiny area on the phone's motherboard. Consequently, the customization may have triggered some unforeseen consequences that have since manifested in the form of the lighter spot.

Risks:
While reports indicate that the lighter spot has no adverse effect on the phone's features or functionality, it poses a significant risk to the device's resale value. As many iPhone consumers use their devices for an average of two years before upgrading, any significant defect that affects the phone's appearance or performance is bound to impact the device's resale value, thereby reducing the owner's return on investment significantly.

Ameliorative Measures:
Apple has remained tight-lipped regarding the issue, although diagnostics equipment may soon include the feature. Meanwhile, iPhone 7 owners are left to fend for themselves. One solution is to be extremely careful when repairing the iPhone 7's shattered screen, ensuring that replacement screens have no lighter spot. However, this is often difficult when dealing with third-party repairers that may not have access to high-quality spare parts.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, it is not all bad news for iPhone 7 owners dealing with a lighter spot issue. For one, the issue does not compromise the phone's functionality or performance, at least not initially. Nevertheless, the potential prospect of a reduced resale value and diminished user satisfaction is still significant and cannot be ignored. Consequently, iPhone 7 owners should exercise utmost diligence when looking for repair experts or even when mishandling the iPhone 7 replacement screens themselves. It is essential to appreciate the issue's severity and take proactive action to address it.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi everybody!
I have an iPhone 7 with a home button that stopped working.  With a little help from you guys, I determined that one of the ribbon cables was torn, and a screen replacement fixed this issue! Thank you!
However, I have a new issue. The replacement screen (from ifixit) has a spot that is slightly discolored when there are lighter things on the screen. Is this an issue with my installation, or a faulty screen? Everything else is perfect!
Update (10/14/2020)

It’s actually in the bottom right corner

 Can you post a picture of the discoloration? In my own experience with fixing the 7 and 8 series is that little silver shield by the ribbon cables in the screen doesn’t align properly and can lead to a yellowish pressure spot in that area.
