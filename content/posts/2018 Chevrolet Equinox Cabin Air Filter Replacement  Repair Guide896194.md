# Stop Breathing in Filth! Discover the Astonishingly Easy Step-by-Step Guide to Replacing Your 2018 Chevrolet Equinox Cabin Air Filter!

As an owner of a 2018 Chevrolet Equinox, one of the most important things you can do for yourself and your passengers is to ensure that the cabin air filter is clean and functioning properly. A dirty cabin air filter not only affects the air quality inside your vehicle but it can also damage your car's HVAC system. With regular replacements, you can enjoy clean and fresh air every time you travel. This article will show you how to replace your cabin air filter easily and quickly in just a few steps.

**Step 1: Locate the Cabin Air Filter**

The first thing you need to do is identify the location of the cabin air filter in your 2018 Chevrolet Equinox. It is located behind the glove box on the passenger side of the car. Open the glove box and locate the stoppers on each side of the glove box. Remove them by pulling them out gently.

**Step 2: Remove the Glove Box**

After removing the stoppers, it's time to remove the glove box itself. To do this, push the sides of the glove box inward until it clears from the dashboard. Then, pull the glove box straight out to remove it from the dashboard. Be careful not to damage the electrical wires on the back of the glove box while removing it.

**Step 3: Remove the Cabin Air Filter**

With the glove box now out of the way, you can access the cabin air filter. To remove the old air filter, slide it out of its compartment carefully. Observe the direction of the airflow arrow printed on the old filter so that you can install the new one in the correct orientation.

**Step 4: Install the New Cabin Air Filter**

It's time to install the new cabin air filter. The installation is straightforward- all you need to do is slide the new air filter into the compartment in the same direction as the old one you removed. Double-check the position of the airflow arrow to ensure it is in the correct orientation. Push the filter all the way into the compartment until it clicks into place.

**Step 5: Reinstall the Glove Box**

With the new cabin air filter installed, it's time to reinstall the glove box. Carefully reinsert the glove box, making sure you do not damage the electrical wires. Push the side pieces back in place to reattach the glove box to the dashboard. Finally, reinstall the stoppers on each side of the glove box to keep it closed securely.

Congratulations, you have successfully replaced the cabin air filter in your 2018 Chevrolet Equinox.
