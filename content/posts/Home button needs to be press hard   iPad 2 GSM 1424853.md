Title: "The Secret Behind Apple's iPad 2 GSM's Hard Press Home Button"

Introduction:

Apple's iPad 2 GSM model has been one of the most popular tablets in the market since its release in 2011. One feature that sets it apart from the other versions is its home button, which requires a hard press to function. In this article, we'll reveal the surprising reason behind this unique characteristic.

Body:

First off, it's important to understand that the home button is an essential part of navigating an iPad. It helps users to return to the home screen, launch Siri or Control Center, and access the App Switcher. Apple has always taken pride in designing its products to make user experience more intuitive, and the home button is no exception.

So, why does the iPad 2 GSM's home button require a harder press than other iPads? The answer lies in a hardware component known as the rubber gasket.

When Apple first released the iPad 2 GSM, it included a new feature designed to improve durability. A rubber gasket was installed around the home button to prevent any debris or fluid from entering the device. This was particularly beneficial for users who wanted to use their iPad 2 GSM in rough, outdoor environments.

However, the rubber gasket also had an unintended consequence - it made the home button harder to press. The gasket acted as a cushion, requiring users to apply more pressure to register a click. It's worth noting that the rubber gasket was removed in subsequent models of the iPad, including the iPad 3 and later versions.

But why did Apple choose to keep the hard-press home button feature in the iPad 2 GSM? There are a few reasons.

Firstly, removing the rubber gasket would have resulted in a thinner, lighter tablet than the original. Apple's decision to retain the gasket was likely a compromise between durability and aesthetics.

Secondly, Apple may have wanted to maintain consistency across all iPad models. By retaining the hard-press home button in the iPad 2 GSM, Apple ensured that users of this version would have a similar experience to the other versions.

Conclusion:

The hard-press home button on the iPad 2 GSM may seem like an oddity, but it has a practical reason behind it. By retaining the rubber gasket, Apple ensured that the device was more durable and could be used in tougher environments. While subsequent models of the iPad did away with this design choice, it's interesting to note how Apple's attention to detail and commitment to user experience extends to small components like the home button.

## Chosen Solution
 So my iPad home button needs to be pushed down really hard. That's the only way will work, when I look at it very closely I noticed that the side of the cover is kind of opening so to me it looks like The adhesive was coming off. What's the best way of fixing that?

 I think you might just need to replace the actual button itself, I have experience the same issue with a old iphone 5 and the home button had just worn out.

 Pull up your screen.  iFixit has a guide that shows how to pry it up.  Once your screen is up, you will see that the home button is secured on in two tiny spots with basically double sided tape.  Remove the old adhesive, make sure you get all of it.  Clean up the bracket and screen so there is no dirt or residue.  Then apply some red tape or your favorite adhesive.  Make sure you set it firmly in place.  Then reseal your screen and you are done.
If it were me, I'd buy a new digitizer that includes a home button assembly.  Chances are that when you pry up your screen, you will scratch it and maybe crack it.  An iPad 2 digi with small pieces isn't very expensive and it will come with the home button, bracket and tape already in place.  It would make very quick work of this job.
