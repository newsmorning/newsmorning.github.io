If you own a MacBook Pro, you may have experienced the strange grinding noise that occurs when you close the lid. This noise can be alarming, as it sounds like something is scratching inside your MacBook Pro. The good news is, this noise is unlikely to damage your device. However, it's important to understand why this is happening and how to fix it, especially if the noise is becoming a nuisance.

The grinding noise is caused by your MacBook Pro's hinges. The hinges allow your laptop screen to open and close smoothly. Over time, the hinges can become loose or misaligned, causing them to grind against each other when you open or close your MacBook Pro. This grinding noise is a sign that the hinges need to be lubricated or replaced.

If you're experiencing this issue, there are a few steps you can take to fix it. Here's what you need to do:

1. Check your warranty
If your MacBook Pro is still under warranty, you may be able to get it fixed for free. Check your warranty to see if this repair is covered.

2. Clean the hinges
If you're comfortable doing so, you can clean the hinges yourself. Use a soft cloth and a small amount of oil, such as WD-40, to lubricate the hinges. This should help the hinges move more smoothly, reducing the grinding noise.

3. Take it to a professional
If you're not comfortable cleaning the hinges yourself or if the noise persists, take your MacBook Pro to a professional. They can diagnose the issue and recommend the best course of action, whether it's lubricating the hinges or replacing them altogether.

It's important to address this issue as soon as possible. Ignoring the grinding noise can cause the hinges to wear down even more, which can lead to more serious issues down the line. Additionally, the noise can be distracting and reduce the overall quality of your MacBook Pro experience.

In conclusion, if you hear a grinding noise when you close your MacBook Pro's lid, don't panic. This is a common issue, caused by worn or misaligned hinges. Follow these steps to fix the issue and ensure your MacBook Pro continues to operate smoothly. With a little bit of TLC, your MacBook Pro will be as good as new.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I have some sort of an issue with my MacBook pro 2019. Whenever I open the lid above 90 degrees, and when I close it, it makes kind of a grind noise as something is touching inside between the lid and the antenna.

This is the noise that is making.
What is your opinion about this stuff? Did you seen or heard anything like this?
Thank you

 No! Don’t mess with it! Time to visit an Apple Store for them to fix it.

 As it is an Apple product, I would advise you to take it carefully from here.
Shake the laptop mildly and notice if something is loose inside it.
If there is no such thing then don’t open it. Take it to the Apple service center.
I hope this helps!
