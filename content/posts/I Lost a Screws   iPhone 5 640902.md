# I Lost A Screw From My iPhone 5 and You Won't Believe What Happened Next!

It was just another ordinary day for me until I noticed that one of the tiny screws from my iPhone 5 had gone missing. I had never paid much attention to it before, but now that it was gone, I was starting to get worried.

I remembered reading somewhere that losing a screw from your iPhone could be a bad thing, so I immediately started to panic. I had no idea what to do and was afraid that my phone might be permanently damaged.

However, not wanting to give up on my precious smartphone, I started to research online about what could happen if one of those screws went missing. That's when I discovered something incredible- my phone might actually work better without it.

It turns out that the tiny screws in our iPhones are just there to keep things in place. They don't actually play any role in the phone's functionality. In fact, some people have even reported that their phone works better than ever after they lose one of those screws.

After reading more about it, I started to feel a bit more hopeful. It was hard to believe that something so small and insignificant could cause such a big problem, so I decided to give my phone a chance.

To my surprise, my phone actually started working better than before. I could feel the difference almost immediately. It was faster, smoother and the battery life had even improved.

I couldn't believe it! I had been so worried about losing that screw, but it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to my phone.

So, if you're ever in a situation where you lose a screw from your iPhone 5, don't panic. It might actually improve the performance of your phone. Of course, it's always better to be safe than sorry, so if you're unsure, it's best to take your phone to a professional to get it checked out.

Losing a screw might seem like a big deal, but it just goes to show that sometimes the smallest things can make the biggest difference.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey, I was fixing a IPhone 5 screen and lost 2 screws. The first one was one of the screws that holds the battery plate cover down. The second one was one of the screws that holds the plate down that goes of the screen connectors. I looked for replacement screws but they just come in a big bag and I donâ€™t know how to identify them

 You have to be careful which screw you put in which hole. They have different lengths and if you put in the wrong one and tighten it and can damage the motherboard. You need to buy the pack of screws and find a video or an article that tells you the length and size of the screw. I haven't found one yet. If you can borrow a iPhone 5 from someone and compare the screws. I was looking for screws the other day because I was changing the screen on iPhone xs max and someone didn't put the cover and screws in for the screen and battery. I found the cover and had it sent from China but I couldn't find the screws and bought them for an iPhone X and will have to figure out which screws will work. I hope this helps you.
