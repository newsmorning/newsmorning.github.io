Microsoft has always been known for its innovative technologies and the company has come up with another revolutionary device called the Surface Duo. The Surface Duo is a dual-screen device that is sure to change the way we use smartphones forever. The device has received a lot of attention from users, and one of the most interesting things about it is the way it runs Microsoft Edge.\nA Brand New Experience Microsoft Edge is a web browser that is built for Windows 10 and is designed to give users a fast and secure browsing experience. It’s known for its sleek interface, its ability to support extensions and its excellent integration with Microsoft services. With the Surface Duo, the Edge browser has been optimized to take advantage of the two screens.\nA Seamless Experience One of the biggest advantages of Edge on the Surface Duo is that it allows users to open two websites side by side with ease. As a result, you can read articles or watch videos on one screen and take notes or browse through related articles on the other. The two screens provide a seamless experience that complements Edge’s design language and makes it easier to multitask.\nBetter Multitasking Options The Surface Duo is ideal for multitasking, and Edge has been designed to take advantage of this. Browsing the web while replying to emails or using other apps is much easier now thanks to the two screens. The device also supports multi-window mode, so you can easily switch between different tabs or apps.\nCompact and Convenient Design While the device is a bit larger than a traditional smartphone, it is still compact and easy to carry around. You can fold it in half, making it easy to fit in your pocket. With Edge’s clean and uncluttered interface, browsing the web is much simpler and convenient than on a regular phone.\nConclusion The Microsoft Surface Duo is a game-changing device, offering features and capabilities that were not possible on a single-screen smartphone. With its revolutionary design and optimized browser, the Surface Duo is a must-have for anyone who values productivity and innovation. If you want to experience Edge’s performance on the Surface Duo, you should consider getting one today. You won’t believe how seamlessly they work together until you try it for yourself!\nMicrosoft has pretty much finished up developing hardware specs for its upcoming Surface Duo. Also, the company has severally showcased how it wants applications designed for dual-screen experiences.\nImages of Microsoft Edge in span mode on the Surface Duo have emerged onlineEdge is Surface Duo’s default web browser.Visit the Edge page to learn more , or check out Microsoft Surface to read the latest news and updates.Would you like to optimize your web browsing experience? Check out our Browser section for insights and practical guides.\nEasy migration: use the Opera assistant to transfer exiting data, such as bookmarks, passwords, etc.\nOptimize resource usage: your RAM memory is used more efficiently than Chrome does\nEnhanced privacy: free and unlimited VPN integrated\nNo ads: built-in Ad Blocker speeds up loading of pages and protects against data-mining\nDownload Opera\nFor example, earlier this year, Microsoft demonstrated on live video how applications like Google Maps can work on an actual Surface Duo.\nHowever, little is known about how each type of software, from media players to browsers, will look like and function on the new form factor.\nNow, the folks at Windows Central have done a great job showcasing images of Android apps that Microsoft is developing for the Surface Duo.\nMicrosoft Edge on the Surface Duo The new Chromium-based Edge, which recently got a built-in spellchecker, is the default browser on Surface Duo.\nAs you may already know, one of the joys of using a dual-screen gadget is the ability to span content across both displays.\nSo, you’ll obviously be able to use Microsoft Edge in multiple screen modes on the upcoming foldable device.\nIf you span the browser across the two screens, the address bar appears on the left display. The other screen displays the favorites section in an icon to the far right.\nAccording to Windows Central’s Zac Bowden, spanning Edge will lead to spreading the web page you’re on across the two screens.\nBut the device’s bezel may block some of the content you’re trying to view. As such, multi-screen mode may not be ideal for some websites.\nAlso on Surface Duo, Edge users will be able to drag and drop items like text, links, and images from web pages to any Android software that supports the feature.\nSpanning Edge will also span websites, but most websites will be left with the Surface Duo’s bezel cutting into the content. Web developers can choose to support dual-screens, but not every website will.\nWhat are your views about using Microsoft Edge on the upcoming Surface Duo?
