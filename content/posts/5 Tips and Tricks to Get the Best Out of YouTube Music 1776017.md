# You Won't Believe These 5 Mind-Blowing Tips To Maximize Your Youtube Music Experience!

Youtube has been a game-changer in the world of music, making it easier than ever to discover new artists and tracks, listen to live performances and music videos, and create personalized playlists. But are you getting the most out of your Youtube music experience? Here are five mind-blowing tips to help you maximize your Youtube music experience.

### 1. Use The Search Bar Strategically

The first thing to do when you visit Youtube for music is to use the search bar strategically. If you're looking for a specific song or artist, type in their name and hit enter, and you'll see a bunch of related results. But did you know that you can also use the search bar to find specific types of videos?

For example, if you're interested in live performances, type in the artist name, followed by "live," and you'll see a list of live performances by that artist. Similarly, if you're interested in music videos, type in the artist name, followed by "music video," and you'll see a list of music videos by that artist.

### 2. Create Your Own Playlist

Creating your own playlist is one of the best features of Youtube. It allows you to create a collection of your favorite music and play it anytime, anywhere. To create a playlist, click on the "plus" sign next to any music video, and add it to your playlist. You can also create new playlists or add videos to existing playlists from your library. With your playlist, you can customize your listening experience and enjoy your favorite music in the order you want.

### 3. Use Youtube Music App

Youtube offers a dedicated music app to help you find new music, listen to playlists, and explore new artists. With the Youtube Music app, you'll have access to personalized recommendations based on your music tastes and a library of over 70 million songs. The app also lets you download music and listen to it offline, making it perfect for long trips or areas with bad network connectivity.

### 4. Explore New Artists With The Explore Tab

One of the best ways to maximize your Youtube music experience is to explore new artists and genres. Youtube's Explore tab is where you can discover new artists, genres, and playlists. You can find the Explore tab by scrolling down the homepage or clicking on the icon at the bottom of the app. With the Explore tab, you can find new music, artists, playlists, and genres that you might not have discovered otherwise.

### 5. Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Last but not least, using keyboard shortcuts can make your Youtube music experience more efficient and enjoyable. For example, you can press the "K" key to pause/play a video, "J" to rewind 10 seconds, and "L" to fast forward 10 seconds. You can also use the arrow keys to adjust the volume, and the "F" key to enter or exit full-screen mode. Using keyboard shortcuts may take some time to get used to, but it can help you save time and enjoy your music more conveniently.

In conclusion, these five mind-blowing tips can help you maximize your Youtube music experience. Whether you're discovering new music, creating playlists, or exploring new artists, make sure you're getting the most out of your Youtube music journey. Try these tips today, and you won't believe how much you can level up your Youtube music experience!

YouTube Music is quite good with music recommendations. It personalizes your playlist based on your listening habit and music preferences. That’s one of the many features that makes YouTube Music stand out and high up there at the top with other popular music streaming platforms. 
 
In this post, we list 5 tips & tricks to help you get the best out of YouTube Music.
 
## 1. Search Songs by Lyrics
 
The search feature lets you find songs by their lyrics. Just type in any part of the song’s lyrics you remember (For instance, if you search the lyrical line, “All i wanna say is that they don’t…….”, the top result will be Michael Jackson’s They don’t care about us).
 
## 2. Save Your Mobile Data
 
If you don’t have access to an unlimited internet connection, you could download your favorite music and listen offline. You’ll save on mobile data and you can stream music even in places with a poor internet connection.
 
There’s also a ‘stream via Wi-Fi only’ feature that ensures that the app only streams music when a Wi-Fi connection is available, not with your mobile data.
 
## 3. Pause History
 
YouTube Music recommends music and creates playlists for you based on your listening history. But sometimes, friends might request to use your YouTube Music account to stream music, thereby making a mess of your recommendations.
 
There is a simple trick around this. You can toggle on the Pause Watch History and Pause Search History options. To do this; open the app and go to Settings > Open Privacy & location and turn on the Pause Watch History and Pause Search History options.
 
## 4. Use Restricted Mode
 
If you are subscribed to the YouTube Music Family plan which lets you add family members from ages 13, and you’d like to protect them from content not suitable for kids, then you should enable Restricted Mode. It blocks out all explicit music and videos on the platform.  
 
## 5. Use Playlist as Alarm
 
With YouTube Music, you could set a song or even your entire playlist as your morning alarm. YouTube Music integrates with the Google Clock app to wake you every morning with your favorite sounds. But first, you’ll need to download the Google Clock app on your device if you don’t already have it installed.
 
That’s it for the tips & tricks to get the best out of YouTube Music. How is the experience using YouTube Music, so far? What are your favorite features on the streaming app? Tell us in the comment section down below.
