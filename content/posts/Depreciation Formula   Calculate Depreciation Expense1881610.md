Unleash the Power of Depreciation Formula and Skyrocket Your Financial Savvy Today!

Are you looking for ways to improve your financial literacy and increase your net worth? Look no further than the power of depreciation formulas. This simple but effective tool can help you not only understand how your assets decrease in value over time, but also how you can use it to your advantage to save money and grow your wealth.

First, let's define depreciation: it is the loss in value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or other factors. This can be anything from a car or a piece of equipment to a building or even intellectual property. Depreciation is an important concept to understand because it affects both your taxes and your cash flow. In other words, it can impact your bottom line.

So, how do you calculate depreciation? There are different methods, but one of the most widely used is the straight-line method. This formula is simple: you take the cost of the asset, subtract the salvage value (the expected value of the asset at the end of its useful life), and divide the result by the number of years the asset is expected to last. The result is the annual depreciation expense.

For example, if you buy a car for $20,000 and expect it to last 5 years with a salvage value of $5,000, the annual depreciation expense would be ($20,000 - $5,000) / 5 = $3,000. This means that each year, your car loses $3,000 in value. By understanding this formula, you can plan your expenses and prioritize your purchases based on their expected useful life.

But depreciation can also be used as a tax deduction. When you own a business or rental property, you can deduct depreciation expenses from your taxable income. This allows you to lower your overall tax liability and keep more of your earnings. However, it's important to note that some assets may lose value faster than the straight-line method suggests, and others may not qualify for depreciation at all.

In summary, understanding the power of depreciation formulas can help you increase your financial savvy and ultimately grow your wealth. By knowing how to calculate depreciation, you can make better purchase decisions, plan your expenses more effectively, and take advantage of tax deductions. So, what are you waiting for? Start crunching those numbers and unleash the power of depreciation today!

## Formula to Calculate Depreciation Expense
 
The formula of Depreciation Expense is used to find how much asset value can be deducted as an expense through the income statement. Depreciation may be defined as the decrease in the asset’s value due to wear and tear over time. It is a non-cash expense forming part of profit and loss statements. E.g., depreciation on plant and machinery, furniture and fixture, motor vehicles, and other tangible fixed assetsTangible Fixed AssetsTangible assets are assets with significant value and are available in physical form. It means any asset that can be touched and felt could be labeled a tangible one with a long-term valuation.read more.
 
There are primarily 4 different formulas to calculate the depreciation amount. Let’s discuss each one of them –

### Explanation
 
Depreciation is an indirect expense systematically charged on tangible fixed assetsFixed AssetsFixed assets are assets that are held for the long term and are not expected to be converted into cash in a short period of time. Plant and machinery, land and buildings, furniture, computers, copyright, and vehicles are all examples.read more to provide the actual cost of an asset over its useful life is proportional to benefits derived from such assets. The calculation of the depreciation equation requires knowledge of some factors. These factors are:
 
- Cost of an Asset:  Asset cost includes the amount paid to purchase such assets and other related expenses to bring such assets into a usable position, such as transportation, installation, taxes paid, etc.Residual Value: Residual ValueResidual ValueResidual value is the estimated scrap value of an asset at the end of its lease or useful life, also known as the salvage value. It represents the amount of value the owner will obtain or expect to get eventually when the asset is disposed.read more is the amount expected to realize at the end of the useful life of an asset.Useful life: Expected life of an asset up to which an organization can derive benefits from it.Rate of Depreciation: It is the rate at which an organization should reduce the value of an asset in proportionate to benefits derived from such assets.

 
### Depreciation Expense Calculation Examples
 
#### Example #1
 
Company XYZ purchased an asset of $15,000 and expected to realize $1,500 at the end of its useful life. The expected useful life of an asset is five years. What amount of Depreciation should the Company charge in its profit and loss statement?
 
Solution
 
Below is data for calculation of the depreciation amount
 
- Cost of Asset: $15,000Salvage Value: $1,500Useful Life of Asset: 5

 
Therefore, the calculation of Depreciation Amount using Straight-line MethodStraight-line MethodStraight Line Depreciation Method is one of the most popular methods of depreciation where the asset uniformly depreciates over its useful life and the cost of the asset is evenly spread over its useful and functional life. read more will be as follows,
 
Using Straight-line Method =  Cost of Asset- Salvage Value/ Useful Life of Asset
 
- =($15000-$1500)/5

 
Depreciation Amount will be –
 
- =$2700

 
So, the company should charge $2,700 to profit and loss statements and reduce asset value from $2,700 every year.
 
#### Example #2
 
Now let us take an example to understand the diminishing balance method: Mr. X, senior accountant of company ABC Pvt. LTD. The company got a quotation of $ 135,000 for Delta machinery. Company estimated a further expense of $ 2,200 on its transportation and installation. It is estimated that the asset can be sold for $1,200 at the end of its useful life.
 
Calculate the rate of depreciation is 15%.Mr. X wants to charge depreciation using the diminishing balance method and wants to know the amount of depreciation it should charge in its profit and loss accountProfit And Loss AccountThe Profit & Loss account, also known as the Income statement, is a financial statement that summarizes an organization's revenue and costs incurred during the financial period and is indicative of the company's financial performance by showing whether the company made a profit or incurred losses during that period.read more. Help Mr. X calculate the depreciation and closing value of the machine at the end of each year.
 
First of all, we will calculate the actual cost of machine delta to the company:
 
Now, we will calculate the depreciation amount and closing value of the asset using a diminishing balance method:
 
Therefore, the calculation of the Depreciation Amount of 1st year using the diminishing balance method will be as follows,
 
Diminishing balance Method = Actual cost of Asset*Rate of depreciation/100
 
- =137000*20%/100%

 
Depreciation Amount for 1st year will be –
 
- =27400.00

 
Similarly, we can calculate the depreciation amount for remaining years
 
Calculation of Closing Value of 1st year
 
- =137000-27400=109600.00

 
Similarly, we can calculate the closing value for the remaining years
 
So after the 10-year book value of the machine is $19030.82.
 
#### Example #3
 
Let us take another example to understand the unit of production method formula. A company called beta limited just started its business of manufacturing empty biodegradable water bottles. After market research, it comes across a fully automated machine that can produce up to 1,500,000 in its complete life cycle.
 
The company got a quotation of $ 210,000. It also requires $ 25,000 as installation charges, and the company expected to sell this machine after the end of its usable life for $ 2000. Calculate the amount of Deprecation the Company should charge in its books of accounts. Company share with you its annual bottle manufacturing details:
 
First of all, we will calculate the actual cost of the machine to the company:
 
- =$210000+$25000=$235000

 
Now we will calculate the amount of depreciation in each year to be charged using the Unit of Production Method,
 
Using the Unit of Production Method = (Actual Cost of Machine – Salvage Value)/ Useful Life in the Form of Unit Produced
 
Here useful life in the form of unit produced is the total unit produced in the year divided by total expected units to be produced.
 
- =(235000-2000)*(145000/1500000)

 
Amount of Depreciation in each year to be charged will be –
 
- =22523.33

 
Similarly, we can calculate the depreciation amount for remaining year to be charged –
 
- =235000-22523.33=212476.67

 
### Relevance and Use
 
Depreciation is an indirect expense and an important accounting procedureImportant Accounting ProcedureThe accounting procedure is the process of standardized nature that performs a specific accounting function designed to incorporate better risk management policies to complete these functions efficiently. It includes billings, invoices to suppliers, bank reconciliation, requiring comprehensive and streamlined procedures.read more for an organization to estimate the book value of an asset after its usage during the accounting period. The Depreciation formula uses the Deprecation formula to spread the asset’s cost over its useful life, thereby reducing the huge expense burden in a single year. Following are the importance of the depreciation formula in accounting:
 
- Since depreciation is a non-cash expense, it helps entity to reduce its tax liabilities.At the time of sale of the asset, the company can estimate its profit/loss on the sale of the asset after considering its usage, which is in the form of depreciation.Since the purchase amount of assets is huge, charging it in a profit and loss account in one shot significantly decreases the profit. But by charging expenses proportionate to benefits, the expense burden is distributed over the useful life of the asset.
