## Chosen Solution
 Hi,I’m wondering if it’s possible for a newbee to replace one of the usb-c (Thunderbolt)  port of an 2017 Macbook pro with a touch bar. To be more precise, the failling one is the bottom one on the right side of the laptop.
Thanks a lot for your answers and recommendation.

 Definitely, you can find the spare part on eBay, just look for A1706 Usb right port, it’s not an expensive part either. Then you’ll need a bit of tools, since you’ll face pentalobe and torx screws. Probably a basic iFixit toolkit will suffice for the purpose. There’s no specific guide on iFixit for the port replacement, but you will have to go through the same steps as for the battery replacement guide until step 65, then you’ll have access to the port that needs replaced.
Follow @shahramm recommendations and you are ready to go. Mind you that a non working port may be due to the port itself or some component on the logic board, thus be ready to a possibility that replacing the port won’t solve your issue. Here’s the guide:

 In al honesty, I would say no. However, that’s my personal opinion and have no idea about your capability. My advice would be to carefully watch a video of it all the way through. If you believe you are capable, you most probably are. I’d then advise rewatching the video and following it strictly. Ensure when following the video you don’t fall into the trap of just listening to it and not watching as there are small things you may notice the professional do that you may otherwise miss.

Good luck!

 I would absolutely give this a go. You have a clear goal, to fix the USB port, so you can research the exact process prior to opening the laptop.
Watch some videos, checkout our teardown, commit to the project!
Get your work space ready and have all the parts and tools to hand.
Give yourself a large clean space as organising your disassembled parts and screws is very important, especially with Apple products. They tend to use a variety of different screw sizes.
Get another device setup so you can follow along with the guide of your choice. A mobile phone is ideal as it takes up very little space.
Wear an electrostatic wrist band and ground it to something nearby (remember, bare metal so no painted metal surfaces).
Be patient and take your time. This is a learning experience and you'll want to give yourself enough time to disassemble and reassemble in one session if possible.
Last bit of advice, if you're in there and you feel you can't carry on, don't be afraid to stop and put things back together! Sometimes you have to process what you've learned, research, then come back and take the next step. We all do it and there's no shame in it.
You got this, we believe in you :)
AND we're here to help if you get stuck!
