# Is Your iPhone 5 Screen Possessed? Discover the Fix for Constant Jumping and Moving!

The iPhone 5 is a reliable phone that works seamlessly and efficiently. However, there may be times when you face certain issues, such as a possessed screen. This problem occurs when the screen of your iPhone 5 keeps jumping and moving without any touch or command. This can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re trying to use your phone for work or personal use. But don’t worry, there’s a solution.

First, why does the iPhone screen behave this way? The constant jumping and moving of the screen is usually caused by a hardware or software problem. The following might be the culprits:

- The touch screen is damaged
- The software on your phone is outdated
- The touch screen connector is loose

Fortunately, you can resolve this problem by following these simple steps:

## Step 1: Restart Your iPhone

Restarting your iPhone can fix a wide range of issues, including a possessed screen. The reason behind this is that it refreshes the phone’s software settings and processes. To restart your iPhone, follow these steps:

- Hold down the "Power" button located on the right side of your iPhone.
- Swipe the power icon to the right to turn off your iPhone.
- Wait for 10 seconds, then press and hold the "Power" button until you see the Apple logo on your screen.

## Step 2: Check for Damage

Inspect your iPhone 5’s touch screen for any damages. If your iPhone screen has been cracked or dropped, this may be the reason behind the possessed screen. In this case, you may need to replace your phone’s screen by taking it to a repair shop.

## Step 3: Update Your iPhone

Updating your iPhone’s software to the latest version can fix the possessed screen issue. This is because updates contain patches and bug fixes that repair any issues that your iPhone may have. To update your iPhone, follow these steps:

- Go to "Settings".
- Tap "General".
- Select "Software Update".
- Select "Download and Install".
- Enter your passcode if prompted.

## Step 4: Reset Your iPhone to Factory Settings

Resetting your iPhone to factory settings can also help solve the possessed screen issue. However, this should only be done if the other steps didn’t work. Keep in mind that when you reset your iPhone to factory settings, all your data will be erased. If you’re going to take this route, make sure that you back up all your data before resetting. To reset your iPhone to factory settings, follow these steps:

- Go to "Settings".
- Tap "General".
- Select "Reset".
- Select "Erase All Content and Settings".
- Enter your passcode if prompted.

In conclusion, a possessed screen on your iPhone 5 can be incredibly frustrating. However, don’t worry too much as there are simple solutions that you can try to fix the issue. The above steps can significantly help you solve the issue, but if the problem persists, you should consider taking it to a professional repair shop.

 Hi Guys,
My iPhone 5 screen now jumps and moves erratically on its own. I have tried other screens and its definitely not them.
I cannot begin for the life of me what it would be ?
Any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks
Update
Anything to do with the proximity sensor guys ? Auto brightness doesn't work neither

 My iPhone 5 keeps jumping even writing this msg has been a problem.. It keeps skipping and going back and forth.. So annoying..what do I do?

 Same problem with my iphone 6 plus jumping and keying by its own, like possessed!

 I've read a few different forums, some say it's by not using the official Apple charger/plug...
(No luck-I use all Apple's chargers and not any 3rd party ones, and it still happens.)
Weird but Temporary Fix!!

>>The easiest but most inconvenient fix is that you have to take the phone out of its case.<<
>>Then magically it will work. <<

I'm thinking that because the phone gets too hot, being inside a case the heat transfer makes the phone act up.
I have an iPhone 5s and I just thought it was my phone that did that. I never noticed the erratic scrolling right away as I tolerate random glitches to an extent. Eventually I got fed up with it after many nights of laying in bed just scrolling through Instagram and it would go all over the place and scroll back to the top.
I've had my phone for almost 3 years now, (waiting to upgrade) but I guess it still occurs with later gens of phones too.

 My phone is also acting up, it auto deletes characters of my password a couple times when I try to get into my phone. When i do get into my phone its almost like the screen is auto swiping to the other page or it wont swipe at all to a dif home page. Then when i go on snapchat, the phone glitches out and swipes back and forth or just wont let me type. Its an iphone 5s I would really appreciate a fix.

 Hi there make sure this part black tape covering it on both sides if any of the electrical interference touchs underneath it or above will cause your problem.

 Yes sorry I thought I did lol

 Apple support has a very similar issue that has NOT been resolved either.
Remedy response on Apple' Support Blog stated the following solutions that did not work.
Hard Reset Remedy
Charging issue possibly
Total backup and reset the iPhone Remedy
No solution found
My issue is after my iPhone 5 phone rest awhile charging; when I first cut on my phone the digi screen issues occur.
screen starts zooming out/in with one finger touching.
Touch the digi screen anywhere and the screen can jump clear to other side of the screen.
Selects other screen options that where not selected by user.
Jumps around spastically like a muscle jumps in the body without cause.
I'm roughly an hour from the nearest apple store so i may take my iPhone 5 to them
If no resolve or update is found by Saturday.

 I think it's an ios8 problem. I had it on my iPhone 5 on ios8 and the screen was jumping around. Had to live with it for nearly a year. Just recently updated iPad Air from iOS 7 to 8 and now the iPad is jumping around too, first when it was on charge. Didn't do that at all on ios7. Can't remember if my iPhone 5 did that when not on charge or shortly after one. It's very annoying though,

 Imagine a complex electronic device with no way to recalibrate it... If ANYTHING is changed you're gonna have problems! Is it supposed to be self calibrating?
With all the posts i have seen about this issue it seems like this is an epidemic! I feel like there is more to this problem than apple is telling anyone...

 thank you!!! This is exactly the problem I'm having with my iPhone 5c. When it's unplugged it works great! When it's plugged in it jumps all over the place and selects things I never selected and won't let me scroll down and zooms weird and it's sooooo frustrating!!!!! Thank you! I wonder if it's because I'm not using an Apple charger? It's like half Apple :) I'll try my other charger and see if that helps.
Thank you!!!

 Hello
I started to have the same problem with my Iphone X once I upgraded it to the latest version, some icons do not respond, and pictures in social networks are getting bigger or smaller on their own. Phone is literally is living its own life. It is annoying. What to do? Thank you

 Apple knows this is and has been a problem ALL along. Thus, the push for a newer models. Their prices do not justify their quality anymore. Not a peep out of Apple or any resolve , fix or bug corrections. Updates usually are to push more of their agenda. But Windows is even worse! ... They have endless “updates” which is code for updating ALL of your private information.

 If you have replaced the screen with a new
one and it is still doing that weird thing then it could be be defective logic board as a result of accidentally dropping the phone.

 Update data it  or if that does not work true getting a new charge
