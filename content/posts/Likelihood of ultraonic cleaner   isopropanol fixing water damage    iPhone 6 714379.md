# Revive your water damaged iPhone 6 with this easy ultrasonic cleaner and isopropanol hack!

Water damage to your iPhone is one of the worst nightmares that can come true for any smartphone user. It can happen in the blink of an eye, and the repercussions can be devastating. Your iPhone may become unresponsive, display weird images, or worst of all, fail to power on.

However, did you know that all hope is not lost even if your iPhone 6 has suffered water damage? With the help of an ultrasonic cleaner and some isopropanol, you can revive your smartphone back to life!

## What you'll need

Before we jump into the process of reviving your water damaged iPhone 6, let's go through the list of things you'll need:

- An ultrasonic cleaner (you can find them online or at electronic stores)
- 99% isopropanol (rubbing alcohol)
- A clean cloth or paper towel
- A bowl or container

## The process

Now that you have all the necessary items, let's revive your water damaged iPhone 6 with this easy ultrasonic cleaner and isopropanol hack:

1. Switch off your iPhone and make sure it's powered down completely.
2. Remove the SIM card and any other accessories that may be attached to your phone.
3. Fill a bowl or a container with 99% isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) and place your iPhone 6 in it. Make sure that your phone is fully submerged in the alcohol.
4. Let your iPhone soak in the alcohol for about 60 minutes. This will help dissolve any dirt, grime or mineral deposits that may have accumulated in the phone due to water damage.
5. Now, take your iPhone out of the alcohol and place it in an ultrasonic cleaner. Turn on the ultrasonic cleaner and let it run for 3-5 minutes.
6. After the ultrasonic cleaning is complete, remove your phone from the cleaner and let it air dry. Don't use any heat or hairdryer to dry your phone. Just let it dry naturally for a minimum of 24 hours.
7. Once your phone is completely dry, reinsert the SIM card and power it on.

That's it! Your iPhone 6 should now be back to its former glory.

## Final thoughts

Water damage can happen to anyone, and it's essential to know what steps to take to rescue your phone from the brink of death. This easy ultrasonic cleaner and isopropanol hack can help you revive your water damaged iPhone 6.

## Chosen Solution
 If I have a water damaged iPhone 6 which isn't turning on due to water damage, what is the likelihood that putting it in an ultrasonic cleaner with 99.9% isopropanol will fix it?
Out of ten, roughly, how many would it fix?
And what's the recommended amount of time to leave it in the Ultra sonic cleaner for?
Thanks

 Hi john to answer your question is the ultrasonic cleaner and I am talking the $100 versions for me it works 7 out of 10 times and I set mine on for about 5 to ten minutes but I use electronic cleaning solution and my mixture is about 4% cleaner and 96% distilled water but with the alcohol solution I am going to be honest and say I don't know. The stuff I use is industrial so you have to contact the company to get it but here is the link http://www.echemproducts.com/ultrasonic-... now for the ultrasonic cleaner this is what I use and your getting a better deal than I did for $76 instead of a $100 https://www.pce-instruments.com/us/index....
