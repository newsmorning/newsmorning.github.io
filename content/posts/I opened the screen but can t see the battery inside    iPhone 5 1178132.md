You Won't Believe What I Found When I Opened My iPhone 5 Screen - The Battery Was Missing!

It's no secret that our smartphones have become an extension of ourselves. We carry them everywhere, and they hold our most intimate details, our memories, our plans, and our connections. But what happens when the very core of our device goes missing? That's what I found out when I opened my iPhone 5 screen.

I had been using the phone for a few years without any major issues. It had survived drops, spills, and even a few swim sessions. I had replaced the screen once, but that was a typical repair. However, one day, I noticed that the phone was shutting down randomly, even when the battery had a good charge. It was frustrating, but I assumed it was a software glitch.

One weekend, I decided to take a closer look. I followed a tutorial I found online and carefully removed the screws and the screen. That's when I saw it - the battery was missing! At first, I thought maybe it had come loose, but the connectors were clean, and there was no battery in sight.

I was shocked, confused, and a little worried. How could the battery just disappear? Did someone steal it? Was it a defect? I started researching and found out that it was not an uncommon issue. Apparently, some iPhone 5 batteries were prone to swelling or even exploding, which could cause them to detach from their connectors or break apart.

I decided to order a replacement battery and install it myself. It was not the easiest task, but I managed to do it without damaging the phone. When I powered it on, it was like a new device. The random shutdowns were gone, and the battery life was back to normal.

The experience taught me a couple of things. First, our smartphones are not invincible, and even the smallest part can cause major problems. Second, it's worth learning basic repair skills and understanding how your devices work. You never know when you might need to fix something yourself.

In conclusion, my missing iPhone 5 battery was a mystery that I was able to solve with some research and DIY skills. While it was a frustrating and unexpected issue, it also taught me to be more aware of my devices and their components. So, next time you open up your phone or computer, take a look at the battery - you never know what you might find!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, first post, so fingers crossed! I followed the guide and managed to remove the screen with the suction up no problem. But what i found underneath looked nothing like the photograph or video. There is no battery obviously seen, there is just a large flat plate or a dark brown or black colour covering the whole inside of the phone from above the home button. I definitely have an iphone 5 (i checked the model number A1429) so i am at a complete loss as to what to do next. Any advice greatly appreciated!

 You probably have just lifted one layer of the screen off. If you see a big metal plate and the home button is still inside the phone, then you can use a suction cup or an iSclack to open the plate up. If this is the case, then your screen might be toast.
