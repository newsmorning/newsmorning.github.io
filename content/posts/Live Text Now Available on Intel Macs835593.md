# Revolutionary Update: Intel Macs Can Now Text Live - Here's How!

In a world where communication technology is constantly evolving, Apple has once again set itself apart by introducing a revolutionary update that is sure to change the way we communicate through our Macs -- live texting.

Until recently, Mac users could only send and receive text messages through their iPhones, but with the new update, Intel Macs can now text live as well. What's even better is that the messaging feature on Mac has been revamped, making it more seamless and user-friendly.

So, how does it work?

Firstly, you must have the latest version of macOS installed on your Intel Mac. Next, sign in to your iCloud account and make sure that two-factor authentication is enabled. This is crucial as it provides an extra layer of security to protect your messages.

Once you've done that, you can start sending and receiving messages from your Mac. Open the Messages app from the dock, and you'll see all your existing iMessage conversations, as well as new ones you start from scratch.

To send a new message, click on the new message icon on the top left corner of the app. A new window will pop up, and you'll be able to enter the recipient's phone number, email address, or Apple ID. Once you've done that, type your message and hit send.

You can also send photos, videos, and other attachments through the app. Click on the paper clip icon, and you'll be able to insert anything from your Mac's files. Additionally, typing "@name" will direct your message to a specific person in a group chat, making group conversations much more organized.

The best part about this update is that you can seamlessly switch between your Mac and iPhone while texting. If you're typing a message on your Mac and need to step out, you can pick it up from your iPhone without losing your progress. The conversation will remain synced across all your Apple devices, making it convenient and easy to keep up with your messages.

In conclusion, the live texting feature on Intel Macs is a game-changer. It makes communication more accessible and efficient, especially for users who work on their Macs for long periods. With just a few clicks, you can now send and receive messages from the same device you use for work, saving you time and multitasking efforts. So, update your Mac and start texting away!

Apple is expanding its Live Text feature to be able to run on Intel-based Macs with Monterey beta 4.

 

Live Text is Apple’s image-scanning and text-identifying technology that digitizes the text in a photograph and makes it interactive. Users can, for example, call or save a phone number they see on a photo, copy and paste text, or even edit out personal information.

 

The feature is already available on iOS 15 and was originally thought to be limited to M1 Mac computers and newer versions of MacBook Airs and Pros. However in the most recent release notes for Monterey beta 4, Apple said, "Live Text now works across all Mac computers that support macOS Monterey."

 

Users on social media have been able to confirm that it’s possible to use Live Text on the older Intel models such as a Mac Pro from 2008.

 

Monterey version 12 is the 18th major release of macOS and is currently undergoing a public beta. Some of the new features include a Portrait mode for FaceTime that blurs the background, upgraded Apple Maps that adds a new globe view and more details to cities such as New York and London, and more text-to-speech voices. However, these features are exclusive to M1 Macs.

 

Apple has yet to announce if and when it will be bringing these new features to Intel-based Macs or has any intention to do so. But the implementation of Live Text highlights the possibility that the new features might move over.
