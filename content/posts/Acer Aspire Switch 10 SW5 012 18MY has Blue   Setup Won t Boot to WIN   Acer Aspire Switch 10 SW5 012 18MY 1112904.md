## Chosen Solution
 Blue Screen with Code 0cx0000225. Can get to 5.0 Setup Utility but won't boot. Did create Windows boot USB for this model. Nothing. Have tried everything on YouTube, Windows, and this sit (that I saw).  Just won't boot to Windows. changing boot order makes no difference. Saw a reset hole. No change after holding down as indicated.

 Try booting to Linux Live.  To do this, go to one of the Linux sites (e.g. www.linuxmint.com) and download one of the ISO files listed. Then double click on the ISO file to create a Linux install DVD.  Then try to boot the Acer laptop with the Linux install DVD.  If successful, it will put you into Linux Live.  (This won't install anything on your hard drive, unless you specifically tell it to install Linux.)
Try some things while in Linux - surf the web, etc.  If all works while you are in Linux, then there is a Windows issue, not a laptop hardware issue.  Actually, it is possible that there could be a hard drive issue, but you won't know from booting into Linux Live, because Linux Live doesn't use the hard drive to run, it uses the DVD.
