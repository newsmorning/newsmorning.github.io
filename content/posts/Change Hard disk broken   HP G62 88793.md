# Revive Your HP G62 with This Incredible Trick to Replace a Broken Hard Disk - You Won't Believe How Simple It Is!

### Introduction

If you are an HP G62 laptop user, then you might be familiar with the occasional hard disk failures. It is a common problem that most of us have to face. However, this problem can be a significant headache if it happens to you, especially if you don't know how to replace the hard disk yourself. Fear not! In this article, we will show you how to replace a broken hard disk on your HP G62 laptop easily.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare tools and the new hard disk**

The first step, of course, is to prepare the necessary tools and the replacement hard disk. You will need a screwdriver, an external hard disk enclosure, a new hard disk, and a bootable USB drive with your operating system on it. The hard disk enclosure is optional, but highly recommended as it will allow you to copy your data from the old hard disk to the new one easily.

2. **Shutdown and unplug your laptop**

Make sure that your laptop is turned off and unplugged from the power source. Turn the laptop over and remove the battery as well.

3. **Locate the hard disk compartment**

The hard disk of the HP G62 laptop is located on the bottom of the laptop, as shown in the picture. It is enclosed in a plastic casing that is fastened to the laptop with retaining screws. Locate the compartment and remove the screws that keep the casing in place.

4. **Remove the old hard disk**

Once the screws are removed, gently lift the plastic casing to reveal the old hard disk. Carefully disconnect the cables of the hard disk and remove it from the compartment.

5. **Install the new hard disk**

Take the new hard disk and connect it to the same cable that was connected to the old hard disk. Carefully place the new hard disk inside the compartment and screw the plastic casing back in place.

6. **Reinstall the operating system and restore your data**

Once the new hard disk is installed, you will need to reinstall your operating system. Insert your bootable USB drive and follow the installation instructions. If you have an external hard disk enclosure, you can copy your data from the old hard disk to the new one easily.

7. **Test the new hard disk**

Once the installation is complete, test the new hard disk by running some basic programs, such as web browsers and word processors. Make sure everything is working correctly.

### Conclusion

Replacing a broken hard disk on your HP G62 laptop is not as difficult as it seems. By following the steps we have outlined in this article, you can easily and quickly replace a broken hard disk and get your laptop up and running again.

 Hi @giomun ,
Here is a link to the service manual for your laptop. Scroll to p.42 to view the necessary pre-requisite steps and then the procedure to remove the HDD. Just reverse the procedure to install the new HDD.
Also on p.42 you will find the part numbers for HDDs for the laptop. You may wish to consider installing a SSD instead so as to improve performance.
Try various sites such as here and here (select your exact model number in the model box) to see if this option interests you or not.
Usually the BIOS setting is for automatic HDD detection so you shouldn't have to make any changes to   the settings in the BIOS.
