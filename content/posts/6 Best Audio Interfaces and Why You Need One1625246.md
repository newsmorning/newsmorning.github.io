If you’re serious about music production, having the perfect audio interface is a top priority. But choosing the right interface can be a challenge, especially if you’re new to audio production. 
 
In this article, we’ll describe what an audio interface is, why you need one, and 6 of the best entry-level to professional-grade audio interfaces. 
 
## What Is an Audio Interface and Why Do You Need One?
 
An audio interface connects your microphone and instruments to your PC and converts the analog signals into a digital audio format that your computer software can recognize and interact with. This is why they’re also referred to as “converters”. It also connects to your studio monitors and headphones, transmitting sound directly from the inputs.
 

 
An audio interface is necessary if you want to record sound from instruments and other audio devices as it will help you achieve much higher sound quality when producing. 
 
Some of the things to consider when choosing an audio interface are: 
 
- The input/output configuration. Inputs are where you connect incoming sound devices, like guitars or microphones. The number of outputs will determine what kind of speaker setup you can connect to. Depending on your uses, you may only require one or two inputs/outputs. However, if you want to record from multiple sources at a time (for instance, if you need multiple instruments and vocals), then you’ll need more. Interfaces range from 2-in/2-out to hundreds of channels.

 
- The type of inputs/outputs. Depending on the audio interface, it may have line inputs and instrument inputs. Line inputs take line-level (high-power) signals from powered equipment like a synth, whereas instrument inputs are designed for things like mics and guitars that produce a low-voltage signal (this is where preamps help by raising the signal to line-level). The connection format is also important depending on your needs (e.g. 1/4”, XLR, TRS, ADAT, RCA connectors). Like inputs, you’ll want to pay attention to what format the outputs are and whether this matches your equipment and needs.The type of connection. Most interfaces connect to a workstation via a USB cable (Windows) or via FireWire (for recording on Apple Mac and iOS devices like iPads). Newer models use USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt. The final type of connection is PCIe which involves installing the interface into your computer’s motherboard. These are generally reserved for high-throughput professional studios and are generally more expensive.

 
- Bitrate and sample rate. The higher these are, the better overall audio quality you will record. Most audio interfaces in this list have a 24-bit bitrate and 192kHz sample rate, which is sufficient for almost all uses.Brand. Several brands create high-quality audio interfaces, including Behringer, Presonus, Motu, Clarett, M-Audio, Audient, and so on. Some of these focus on different niches, so depending on whether you’re a singer/songwriter, podcaster, band, producer, or film scorer, some brands may be better suited to your needs.

 
With that out of the way, here are 6 of the best audio interfaces ranging from low-budget to professional-grade options.
 
## 1. Behringer U-Phoria UMC404HD
 
The cheapest option on our list, the UMC404HD is perfect for those on a budget. At only $169.00, this Behringer interface gives an impressive bang for the buck. Some of its features include:

There are some obvious downsides to this USB audio interface like the older USB ports, but at the price point, it remains one of the best options.
 
## 2. Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Third Gen
 
There are several Focusrite audio interfaces, many of which are highly regarded by producers. On a budget (or for beginners), the best option is the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Third Gen which is suited to solo or duo recording.

## 3. Audient ID4 MkII
 
The Audient ID4 Mark II is a high-quality and affordable audio interface with the perfect functionality for your home studio. Replacing the discontinued original model, the ID4 MkII brings several new features to the plate, including faster USB 3.0 speeds and updated cosmetics.
