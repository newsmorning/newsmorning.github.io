# SHOCKING REVELATION: Your Loop Hero boss rewards may NOT be permanent - Discover the truth NOW!

As a Loop Hero player, you may have been delighted to receive a rare item or a powerful card as a reward from defeating a boss. After all, these rewards are hard-earned through multiple loops of the game and can give you an edge in battling tougher enemies or advancing further into the game's story.

However, a recent discovery in the Loop Hero community has revealed that some of these rewards may not be permanent, and may disappear after a certain condition is met.

According to this revelation, certain boss rewards such as The Forgotten Altar or the Unforgotten have a hidden condition attached to them that can cause them to vanish from your inventory without warning. This condition could be triggered by a variety of actions, such as completing a certain number of loops or using a specific card in your deck.

The consequences of losing these rewards could be severe, as they provide unique benefits that are not easily obtainable elsewhere. For example, The Forgotten Altar can summon a golden card, while the Unforgotten can resurrect an ally who died in battle.

So how can you protect yourself from losing these precious rewards? Here are some tips:

1. Learn about the hidden conditions attached to boss rewards. While some players may enjoy discovering these conditions on their own, others may prefer to seek out guides or forum discussions that reveal them. Knowing what triggers the disappearance of a reward can help you avoid that condition and keep the reward indefinitely.

2. Backup your save files regularly. If you do end up losing a boss reward, you may be able to revert to a recent save file that still has the reward in your inventory. Make sure to save your progress frequently and keep multiple backup copies in case of a file corruption or other issue.

3. Plan your deck and loops strategically. By carefully selecting cards for your deck and choosing which enemies to attack and which to avoid, you can minimize the risk of triggering any hidden conditions that may cause rewards to disappear. Additionally, planning your loops around specific goals or milestones can ensure that you don't accidentally trigger a condition prematurely.

In conclusion, the revelation that some Loop Hero boss rewards may not be permanent is a sobering reminder of the game's complexity and depth. While it can be disheartening to lose a hard-earned reward, the knowledge and strategies outlined in this article can help you protect your inventory and progress through the game with confidence. Stay vigilant and good luck on your next loop!
