## Miss Brew: What Does Saeco Royal Mean?

Saeco Royal users have reported that the machine displays a message that says "Miss Brew" on its display screen. Initially, some users thought it was a glitch or an error. However, the frequency of the message's appearance indicated otherwise.

After some investigation, Saeco technicians discovered that "Miss Brew" was a coded message that indicated that the machine's brewing chamber needed cleaning. When the brew chamber gets dirty, it affects the quality of espresso produced, and Saeco Royal notifies the user about it by displaying the "Miss Brew" message.

Therefore, if you see this message on your Saeco Royal, it is essential to descale and clean the brew chamber promptly to ensure that your espresso shots retain their delicious taste.

## Water Circuit Priming: What Is Saeco Royal Trying To Tell Us?

Another cryptic message that Saeco Royal displays is "Water Circuit Priming." What does this mean, and why does Saeco Royal send this message?

Saeco Royal sends this message whenever the water circuit needs priming, which is essential to maintain consistent pressure and temperature when brewing espresso. Water circuit priming is the process of removing air bubbles from the water circuit, which ensures proper functioning of the machine.

If you see the "Water Circuit Priming" message on your Saeco Royal, it means that the machine requires priming. To do so, simply press the hot water button, and let the water flow until no more air bubbles come out.

## Conclusion:

Saeco Royal is a reliable and efficient espresso machine that brews delicious espresso shots. However, it's essential to pay attention to the cryptic messages that it displays on its screen, such as "Miss Brew" and "Water Circuit Priming." These messages indicate that the machine needs cleaning or priming and are crucial for maintaining the quality and consistency of your espresso shots.

Therefore, if you own a Saeco Royal, be sure to check for these messages regularly and take the necessary steps to ensure that your machine is working correctly. With proper care and maintenance, your Saeco Royal can provide you with excellent espresso shots for years to come!
