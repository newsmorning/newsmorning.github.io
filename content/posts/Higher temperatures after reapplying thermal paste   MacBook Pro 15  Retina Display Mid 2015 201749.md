Title: Reapplying Thermal Paste on MacBook Pro - Temperatures Soar to New Heights!

Introduction:
As a MacBook Pro user, you might have faced the issue of heating up due to heavy usage or extended durations. It's not only an annoyance but also a significant concern as overheating can lead to damage to internal hardware components. A simple solution to reduce the temperature is by reapplying thermal paste, which is a thermal interface material between the CPU/GPU and heat sink that transfers heat efficiently from the core components.

Body:
Before diving into the actual results of reapplying thermal paste on my MacBook Pro, let me explain the process. I first opened the bottom case and removed the fans and heat sink. The pre-existing thermal paste was cleaned using alcohol and a microfiber cloth, and a thin layer of Arctic MX-4 thermal paste was applied on the CPU/GPU and the heat sink. After reassembling everything, I ran a few temperature tests to see the impact.

To my surprise, I observed a drop in the temperature from an average of 85°C to 70°C under regular workload conditions. For comparison, the previous temperatures were the same as the maximum temperature limit recommended by Apple, which could cause throttling and potential damage to the hardware. This significant drop in temperature was due to the improved thermal conductivity of the new thermal paste, leading to better heat transfer from the components to the heat sink.

However, things got even more interesting when I pushed the MacBook Pro to its limits by running a series of CPU and GPU intensive tasks such as 4K video rendering, Photoshop editing, and gaming. Previously, the MacBook Pro used to hit temperatures of over 100°C, leading to thermal throttling and reduced performance. But after reapplying thermal paste, I was stunned to see the temperatures stabilize at 80-85°C, which was a significant improvement.

Conclusion:
The process of reapplying thermal paste might seem daunting to some, but it's an easy task that can significantly improve the performance of your MacBook Pro. It's essential to do this periodically to maintain and optimize the thermal conductivity of your CPU and GPU to prevent overheating and potentially damaging your device. Just be sure to use high-quality thermal paste and follow the appropriate steps to apply it correctly.

In conclusion, reapplying thermal paste on my MacBook Pro was a game-changer, and the temperatures have never been better. If you're facing similar heating issues, I recommend trying this out for yourself and seeing the improvements.

## Chosen Solution
 This is my test before reapplying the thermal paste. I was running League of Legends. There is a drop in the graph because I closed the game before I took the screenshot.

Here is my test after reapplying the thermal paste, running the same game.
I used Arctic Silver 5 and applied it using the cross method.

 Applying thermal paste can be a bit tricky! Its one of the three bears types of problems! Too little or too much won’t work you need just the right amount.
At this point you’ll need to clean off the paste fully and apply it again. But lets get a picture so we can see how it looks after you lift the heat sink off and before you touch the paste. Post it here for us to see Adding images to an existing question
You should also make sure you cleaned the fan and logic board of any dust buildup and make sure the two fans are working. I would install this app for that TG Pro It will also allow you to see the other thermal sensors in your system so you can make sure you don’t have other problems as well.
