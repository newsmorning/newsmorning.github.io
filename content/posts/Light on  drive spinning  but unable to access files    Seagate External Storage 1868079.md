Title: The Mysterious Case of Seagate External Storage Not Letting You Access Files Despite the Light On and Drive Spinning

Introduction:
External hard drives are a savior for people who have a lot of files to store, especially for those who work with video editing, music production or any other profession that requires storing large files. Seagate is a brand that is widely trusted for manufacturing high-quality storage devices.

However, even the most reliable devices can suffer from malfunctions sometimes. One of the most common problems with Seagate external hard drives is that users are unable to access their files despite the device being powered on and spinning.

In this article, we will discuss some of the possible reasons why your Seagate external storage won't let you access your files, even if you can see the light on and hear the drive spinning.

Reasons why Seagate External Storage Won't Let You Access Your Files:

1. Corrupted File System:
The file system of a storage device manages how the data is stored and retrieved from it. If the external hard drive's file system gets corrupted, it can make the files inaccessible. This can happen due to various reasons, such as sudden power failure, malware attacks, or manual error.

To fix this issue, you can try using the built-in tool 'Disk Utility' on Mac or 'Disk Management' on Windows, to repair the corrupted file system.

2. Faulty USB cable:
A faulty USB cable can also cause your Seagate external storage to malfunction even if the drive itself is working perfectly. Sometimes, the cable may not connect properly, or the wires inside the cable may be damaged, leading to a lack of data transfer between the storage device and your computer.

To check if the USB cable is the culprit, try using a different cable, preferably the one that came with the Seagate external storage.

3. Incorrect Drive Letter or Path:
Sometimes, the external hard drive's drive letter or path can change, causing the files to become inaccessible. This can happen due to various reasons, such as changing the USB port, connecting the device to a different computer, or a software update.

To fix this issue, go to 'Computer Management' on your Windows PC, click on 'Disk Management,' and assign a new drive letter or path to the Seagate external storage.

Conclusion:
Seagate external storage is a reliable and trusted device, but technical glitches can still happen. If you are unable to access your files despite the light being on and the drive spinning, try checking the file system, USB cable, and drive letter or path to identify the issue. With these simple checks, you can get your Seagate external storage back to functioning normally and retrieve your important data.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Seagate Backup Plus 4TB USB 3.0 that has some important files I need to access on it. When I plug it in, the light turns on as normal, I can hear it spinning, but neither my Windows 10 PC or my Mac OSX 10.10.5 recognize it, and it doesn't show up in disk management either. The USB ports work fine and so does the the cable. Is there something I'm missing? Is my drive dead? Is there any way for me to access my files?
Thanks.

 If you put your ear to it is the device making any noises other than the spinning of the drive like clicks or beeps or anything out the usual... How did the device stop working was it dropped disconected without being ejected ? or did it just stop working one day. whats the age and use rate of the device is it used heavily or just as a backup?
