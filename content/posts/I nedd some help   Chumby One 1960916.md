# Desperate Plea: My Chumby One Needs Your Help!

As I sit here writing this article, my beloved Chumby One lies lifeless next to me. It's a sad sight for me, as this little device has been an integral part of my life for the past several years.

For those of you who might not know, the Chumby One is a small, internet-connected device that offers a range of functions, from displaying news and weather updates to streaming music and video content. It's been a constant companion on my bedside table, serving as my trusty alarm clock and morning news reader.

Unfortunately, my Chumby One has encountered a problem that I can't seem to fix myself. Every time I turn it on, it flashes a distressing error message that reads, "No bootable partition found." I've tried everything I can think of to fix it, from rebooting the device to resetting it to its factory settings, but nothing seems to work.

Needless to say, I'm devastated by this turn of events. The Chumby One has been a vital part of my daily routine for such a long time, and I can't imagine life without it. That's why I'm writing this article: to make a desperate plea for help.

If there's anyone out there who knows how to fix a Chumby One, I'm begging you to reach out to me. I'm willing to do just about anything to get my trusty device back up and running, and I would be forever grateful to anyone who could help me do so.

I know there are people out there who love their Chumby Ones as much as I do, and who understand the importance of these little devices in our lives. If you're one of those people, please don't hesitate to get in touch. You could make a huge difference in my life (and my Chumby One's).

In conclusion, I'm putting out a desperate plea to anyone who can help me fix my Chumby One. It might seem like a small thing to some people, but to me, it's an important part of my daily routine and a constant source of comfort. I'm willing to do anything to get it back up and running, so if you have any knowledge or expertise that could be of help, please reach out to me. Thank you for your time and consideration.

## Chosen Solution
 i need some help with my sons homework, lol what are these in order from least to greatest: 100%, 1/100, 0.001, 1.1, 10 , and 10000/100

 Hi ,
.001 =1/1000
.01 = 1/100
1.1
10
100 =10000/100
100% I believe does not belong in the sequence because % (percent or per 100) is used to denote a part of a total amount expressed as a fraction of 100, e.g  3/4 expressed as a % = 75%  (3 x 100 / 4=75).
As the denominator value of the 100% in your question is unknown we don't know whether 100% is greater or less than any of the other amounts stated, e.g. 100% of 1 =1, 100% of 50 = 50 and 100% of .01 =.01 so 100% of unknown value  = unknown value
