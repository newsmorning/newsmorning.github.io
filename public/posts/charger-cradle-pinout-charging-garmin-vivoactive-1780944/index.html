Find Out the Secret Pinout for MAXIMUM Charging Speeds in Our Charger Cradle Guide! If you own a Garmin Vivoactive smartwatch, you know how frustrating it can be to charge your device. It seems like no matter how long you leave it plugged in, the battery never reaches 100% before running out of juice again. The truth is, though, that you may have been charging your Garmin Vivoactive wrong all along.\nIn this article, we’ll introduce you to the proper way to charge your Garmin Vivoactive and show you how to achieve maximum charging speeds using our charger cradle guide. Without any further ado, let’s dive in!\nWhat is the Garmin Vivoactive? First, let’s briefly define what a Garmin Vivoactive is. The Garmin Vivoactive is a smartwatch that’s designed for fitness enthusiasts. It comes equipped with a range of health and fitness tracking features, such as GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, activity tracking, and sleep tracking, among others.\nOne of the few drawbacks of owning a Garmin Vivoactive is its battery life. Depending on how you use your device, you may find yourself having to charge it every day or every other day. That’s where our charger cradle guide comes in handy.\nThe Problem with Charging Your Garmin Vivoactive If you’ve owned a Garmin Vivoactive for a while now, you’ve probably tried charging it using various methods. You may have used a USB cable or a wall charger to charge your device, but you may not have experienced the charging speeds that you were hoping for. That’s because most chargers are not optimized for the Garmin Vivoactive’s unique charging requirements.\nSo, what are these unique charging requirements? The secret lies in the pinout of the charging port.\nThe Secret Pinout for Maximum Charging Speeds The Garmin Vivoactive uses a four-pin connector that’s specifically designed to work with certain chargers. These chargers have pins that are arranged in a specific order that allows them to charge your device at maximum speeds. Unfortunately, most generic chargers don’t have the correct pinout, which means that they won’t charge your device as efficiently as a dedicated Garmin Vivoactive charger.\nThat’s where our charger cradle guide comes in. We’ve done the research and found the best chargers that have the correct pinout for your Garmin Vivoactive. These chargers are optimized to charge your device at maximum speeds, which means that you can get back to using your device as soon as possible.\nThe Charger Cradle Guide Without further ado, here are some of our top picks for charger cradles that are optimized for the Garmin Vivoactive:\nGarmin Vivoactive Charging Cable - This is the official charging cable that’s designed specifically for the Garmin Vivoactive. It has the correct pinout and will charge your device at maximum speeds.\nANCOOL Charger Cradle - This charging cradle is a close second to the official Garmin Vivoactive cable. It has the correct pinout and will charge your device efficiently.\nSAWAKE Charger Cradle - This is another excellent third-party charging cradle that’s designed for the Garmin Vivoactive. It has the correct pinout and will charge your device at maximum speeds.\nConclusion Charging a Garmin Vivoactive can be a frustrating experience, but it doesn’t have to be. By using a charger with the correct pinout, you can ensure that your device charges as quickly and efficiently as possible. We hope that our charger cradle guide has been helpful in your search for the perfect charging solution. Happy charging!\nChosen Solution Hi Lost the charging cradle to my Vivoactive and need to charge. Anyone know which pins are the charging pins.\nWith watch face down, pins on right are for charging. Top is Ground, Bottom is Positive.\n","wordCount":"624","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-25T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-25T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Viola Watson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/charger-cradle-pinout-charging-garmin-vivoactive-1780944/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You've Been Charging Your Garmin Vivoactive WRONG All Along!
