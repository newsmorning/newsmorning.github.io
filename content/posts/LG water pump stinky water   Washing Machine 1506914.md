Title: Warning! Is Your LG Washing Machine Giving Off a Terrible Odor? The Shocking Reason Behind Stinky Water Revealed!

Introduction
If you've ever opened your LG washing machine only to be met with an unpleasant, musty smell, don't be alarmed. This is a common issue and can be fixed with a bit of care and maintenance. It's important to understand the root cause of the foul smell to prevent it from recurring.

Reason Behind the Smell
The main reason behind the smell is the accumulation of mold and bacteria in the drum and the detergent dispenser. The LG front-loading washing machines, in particular, are more susceptible to mold because of their rubber seals and gaskets that trap moisture, providing an ideal environment for mold growth.

While it can be tempting to try and mask the odor with air fresheners or detergents, this approach won't solve the underlying problem.

How to Fix the Issue
Here are some simple steps to take to banish the smell for good:

1. Clean the drum and the detergent dispenser: Regularly cleaning the drum and dispenser can prevent mold and bacteria buildup. Use a non-abrasive scrubber and a mixture of warm water and vinegar to clean the drum and dispenser. Run the machine on the hottest cycle with no laundry.

2. Air out the machine: Keep the door open after each wash cycle to allow the machine to dry out. This will prevent mold and moisture buildup.

3. Use the correct detergent: Some detergents can create excessive suds, which can lead to mold growth. Make sure to read the manufacturer's instructions and use the recommended amount of detergent.

4. Check the rubber seal: Make sure to clean and dry the rubber seal after each wash cycle. Check for signs of mold or damage, and replace the seal if necessary.

Conclusion
A stinky washing machine can be a frustrating and unpleasant problem. However, with a bit of care and maintenance, you can prevent mold and bacteria buildup and eliminate the foul odor for good. It's important to follow these steps regularly to keep your LG washing machine in tip-top condition.

## Chosen Solution
 I have had my LG front load washer about six months.   I get on my hands and knees after every wash to drain the water from the tube next to the filter.  I get at least two cups of dirty, stinky water every time.  Is this a normal amount or does that sound like too much?  The water stinks horribly every time and makes the whole house stinky! Help!

 Hi @simplysandyb
Check if the washer's drain pipe has been installed correctly as it might be siphoning some water back into the machine.
Also on the following page in the link it shows how to install if draining into a sink and not a standpipe
