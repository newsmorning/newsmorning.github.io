# Unveiling the Top 5 Proven Hacks to Get Your Steam Download Moving Again - Say Goodbye to Download Stuck at 100%!

If you're reading this, chances are your Steam download is stuck at 100%. And if you're like most people, you've probably tried restarting Steam, restarting your computer, and even resetting your router - but nothing seems to work. Well, don't worry, because in this article, we'll be unveiling the top 5 proven hacks to get your Steam download moving again.

## Hack #1: Clear the Download Cache

The first thing you should try when your Steam download is stuck at 100% is clearing the download cache. This is a simple process that can help flush out any corrupt files or data that may be causing the issue. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Steam and click on "Steam" in the top left corner of the window.
2. Select "Settings" from the drop-down menu.
3. Click on "Downloads" from the left-hand menu.
4. Click on "Clear Download Cache" and then click "OK".

After clearing the download cache, restart Steam and try downloading your game again.

## Hack #2: Change Your Download Region

Another reason your Steam download may be stuck at 100% could be because of a server issue in your current download region. By changing your download region, you can connect to a different server and resume your download. Here's how to do it:

1. Open Steam and click on "Steam" in the top left corner of the window.
2. Select "Settings" from the drop-down menu.
3. Click on "Downloads" from the left-hand menu.
4. Under "Download Region", select a different region from the drop-down menu.
5. Click on "OK" to save your changes.

Restart Steam and try downloading your game again.

## Hack #3: Disable Your Firewall or Antivirus

Sometimes, your firewall or antivirus software may be blocking your Steam download, causing it to get stuck at 100%. To rule out this possibility, disable your firewall or antivirus temporarily and see if your download resumes. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your firewall or antivirus software.
2. Disable the software temporarily.
3. Restart Steam and try downloading your game again.

If your download resumes, make sure to enable your firewall or antivirus again after the download completes.

## Hack #4: Check Your Network Connection

Your network connection could also be the reason why your Steam download is stuck at 100%. Make sure you have a stable and fast internet connection to download your game. You can also try resetting your router to see if it helps. Here's how to do it:

1. Unplug your router from the power outlet.
2. Wait for 30 seconds and plug it back in.
3. Restart Steam and try downloading your game again.

## Hack #5: Verify Game Files

Finally, if none of the above hacks work, you can try verifying the game files. Sometimes, the game files may be corrupted or missing, leading to a stuck download. Here's how to verify game files on Steam:

1. Open Steam and go to "Library".
2. Right-click on the game that's stuck downloading and click "Properties".
3. Click on the "Local Files" tab, and then click "Verify Integrity of Game Files".

Steam will verify your game files and replace any missing or corrupted files.

## Conclusion

In summary, if your Steam download is stuck at 100%, try clearing the download cache, changing your download region, disabling your firewall or antivirus, checking your network connection, and verifying game files. With these 5 proven hacks, you can say goodbye to stuck downloads and get back to gaming in no time!
