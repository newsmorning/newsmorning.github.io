This knowledge enables you to determine the true value of your investments, keeping you ahead of the curve in the financial markets.\nIn this ultimate guide, we’ll explore the basics of indexation, explaining the formula used to calculate the price adjustment. We’ll also look at how to apply it practically, using hypothetical examples.\nFirst, let’s define what indexation means.\nIndexation is a formula that adjusts prices for the effect of inflation over time. It’s a way of compensating for the eroding purchasing power of money, ensuring that investors are not misled by nominal price movements.\nNow, let’s dive into the formula.\nThe indexation formula calculates the adjusted price by dividing the current price by the index value, then multiplying by the base year index value. The formula looks like this:\nAdjusted price = (Current price ÷ Current index value) x Base year index value\nHere’s an example to illustrate:\nSay you invested $10,000 in a stock in 2015, and the base year index value was 100. The current index value is 130, and the current price of the stock is $12,000.\nTo calculate the adjusted price, we’ll plug in the numbers:\nAdjusted price = ($12,000 ÷ 130) x 100 = $9,230.77\nSo, the adjusted price is $9,230.77, which is lower than the nominal price of $12,000. This is because the purchasing power of $10,000 in 2015 was greater than the purchasing power of $12,000 in 2021.\nLet’s take a look at another hypothetical example.\nAssume you’re looking to sell your property, which you purchased for $500,000 in 1995. The current index value is 330, and the base year index value is 100.\nTo calculate the adjusted price, we’ll apply the formula:\nAdjusted price = ($500,000 ÷ 330) x 100 = $151,515.15\nTherefore, the adjusted price for your property is $151,515.15, which is significantly lower than the original purchase price. This shows the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of money over time.\nIn conclusion, understanding the indexation formula is essential for any investor. It helps you make informed decisions regarding the true value of your investments, keeping you ahead of the game in the financial markets. Knowing how to calculate adjusted prices using this formula is a valuable tool that will serve you well in your investment journey.\nFormula to Calculate Indexation Cost The formula to calculate indexation cost is represented below,\nYou are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Indexation Formula (wallstreetmojo.com)\nWhere,\nCII stands for Cost of Inflation Index Step by Step Calculation of Indexation Cost Examples Example #1 You are required to compute the current price of X. The cost of X that was purchased in the year 2001 was $100,000. It is now 2019, and the prices of X have increased. What is the current X price provided that CII in the given year, i.e., 2019, is 214 and CII of the base year, which is 2001, is 190?\nFind out the original cost of acquisition, including the cost of the transaction which took place. Note down the Consumer Inflation Index for the year, which could be a year of the sale or any other year. Now, note down the base year’s Consumer Inflation Index. Multiply the original acquisition cost with CII noted in step 2 and divide the same by CII noted down in step 3. The resultant figure is the index value, which shall bring the value of an asset in the current period. Solution\nWe are given here the cost of acquisition, the CII for 2019, and the CII for 2001. Hence, we can use the formula below to calculate the current X price.\nBelow is the given data for the calculation of the current price.\nPurchase Price: 100000.00CII for the given the year 2019: 214.00CII for the base year 2001: 190.00 Therefore, the calculation of the current price is as follows.\n= $100,000 x 214 / 190\nCurrent price will be –\nCurrent Price =$112,631.58 Hence, the current price of X is $112,631.58 per Indexation.\nExample #2 Country X has a system of taxing individuals on the sale of an asset. It has also set up the policy when there is a sale of the asset, and if it’s being sold in a long-term period, then there is a benefit of Indexation applicable. Mr. Kennedy’s resident of country X had purchased the land back in 1990 and has sold the land in the current year. He acquired that land for $153,680, including duties and other transaction costs. After almost a decade, he has sold this asset for $350,900. The capital gains are subject to 15%. Also, the CII for 1990 was 121, and the CII for the year of sale was 211. After applying for indexation benefit, you must compute capital gain on the asset’s sale.\nMr. Kennedy purchased the asset back in the year 1990 and has sold it almost after a decade; hence, he would be subject to long-term capital gain tax. To compute the tax, we need first to find the capital gain, and for that, we need the index acquisition cost.\nBelow is given data for the calculation of Indexation\nPurchase Price: 153680.00CII for the Year of Sale: 211.00CII for the Year 1990: 121.00 Therefore, Indexation Cost can be calculated using the above formula,\n= $153,680 x 211/121\nIndexation will be –\nIndexation = $ 267,987.44 Capital Gain\nCapital Gain = 82912.56 Capital Gain Tax\nCapital Gain Tax = 12436.88 Now, we can calculate the gain, which would be sale less index cost of acquisition which is $350,900 less $267,987.44, which would be $82,912.56\nThe long-term capital gain tax is 15%, which would be applied to the gain we calculated above, i.e., $82,912.56, and 15% of the same would be $12,436.88.\nExample #3 Y is a developed nation. It has a policy of taxing long-term capital gain at 12.5% and short-term capital gain tax at 17%. Also, the country allows indexation benefits for long-term capital gain. Further, the country allows 9% long-term capital gain flat if no indexation benefit is taken. Mrs. Carmella sold an asset for $15,000, subject to long-term capital gain tax. When the asset was purchased for $10,000, the CII for the same was calculated as 158, and the CII for the year of sale was calculated as 177. You must evaluate whether Mrs. Carmella should opt for Indexation or pay long-term capital gain tax, flat at 9%?\nIt is an interesting question where govt. It is flexible with their taxpayersTaxpayersA taxpayer is a person or a corporation who has to pay tax to the government based on their income, and in the technical sense, they are liable for, or subject to or obligated to pay tax to the government based on the country’s tax laws.read more and allows them to pick up the best option where they need to pay less tax.\nMrs. Carmella purchased the asset and is liable for long-term capital gain tax. To calculate the tax, we need first to find out the capital gain, and again to calculate the gain, we need to index the acquisition cost.\nUse the following data for the calculation of Indexation\nPurchase Price: 10000.00CII for the year 2019: 177.00CII for the year 2001: 158.00 = $10,000 x 177/158\nIndexation will be – Indexation =$ 11,202.53\nCapital Gain will be –\nCapital Gain = 3797.47 Capital Gain Tax will be –\nCapital Gain Tax = 341.77 Hence, the gain would be $15,000 less $11,202.53, which would be $3,797.47, and capital gain tax on the same would be 9% of the same, which is $341.77 capital gain tax.\nOption II\nCapital Gain Tax =625.00\nPay capital gain tax @ 12.50% straight on gain of $5,000 ($15,000 less $10,000) which shall be $625.\nHence, the tax outflow is more in option II; the taxpayer should opt for an option I with Indexation.\nRelevance and Uses Indexation is widely used in many countries for gauging economic conditions. As stated earlier, this is the most commonly used measure for valuing the assets to current prices and, by proxy, for knowing the effectiveness of the government’s economic policy. The Indexation shall give the businesses, the government, and citizens a brief idea about the changes in the price of the assets in the economy and can act as a guide to making decisions about the whole economy. Indexation is used in the field of taxation and in other fields of finance to know the true value of the asset purchased from the base year to the current period.\nRecommended Articles This article has been a guide to Indexation Formula.
