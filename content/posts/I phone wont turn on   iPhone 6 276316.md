# Is Your Heart Racing Because Your iPhone 6 Won't Turn On? Read This Now!

Are you freaking out because your iPhone 6 won't turn on? Don't worry, you are not alone. It is frustrating when your iPhone 6 does not turn on, especially when you need to make an urgent call or send an important message. Before you panic, there are a few things you can do to troubleshoot and get your iPhone 6 back up and running.

#### Step 1: Charge Your iPhone 6

When the battery dies, your iPhone 6 will not turn on. So, the first thing you should try is charging your iPhone. Plug your iPhone 6 into a wall charger or USB port to charge the battery. If the battery is completely dead, it may take up to ten minutes before your iPhone turns on.

#### Step 2: Check the Power Button

Sometimes the power button may be stuck or broken, causing your iPhone 6 not to turn on. Check the power button for any visible damage, and try pressing it a few times. If the button is damaged, you may need to take your iPhone 6 to an authorized repair center.

#### Step 3: Restart Your iPhone 6

If your iPhone 6 is frozen, it may not turn on until you restart it. To restart your iPhone 6, press and hold the power button and the home button simultaneously for ten seconds or until you see the Apple logo on the screen.

#### Step 4: Update Your iPhone 6

An outdated iOS can also cause your iPhone 6 not to turn on. Check if there are any available software updates for your iPhone 6 by going to Settings > General > Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it.

#### Step 5: Reset Your iPhone 6

If all the above steps fail, you may need to reset your iPhone 6 to its original settings. Before resetting, make sure to backup all your data to iCloud or iTunes. To reset your iPhone 6, go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.

In conclusion, the above steps should help you get your iPhone 6 back on track. If none of these solutions works, it may indicate a hardware issue, and you should take your iPhone 6 to an authorized repair center. However, do not try to fix the hardware yourself, as you may cause further damage that could be costly to repair.

## Chosen Solution
 my i phone 6 won't turn on as i didnt turn the phone off before i changed the home button. can anyone help with this matter? all connections are housed correctly and ive tried a power restart. also tried disconnecting the battery and holding the power on button. no joys?

 It sounds like you "shocked" your phone. You could've blown numerous components when you had it on. Unless you have a  Oscilloscoop handy, runs around  $400-$1000, then I would say your phone is done. Data recovery might be possible if you can  figure out what components you blew and replace them. Good luck!
