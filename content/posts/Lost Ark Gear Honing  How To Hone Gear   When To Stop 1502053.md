Revamp Your Lost Ark Game with this Ultimate Gear Honing Guide – Discover the Ultimate Tips & Tricks to Hone Your Gear Perfectly & Know Exactly When to Stop!

Lost Ark is an exciting multiplayer online role-playing game that offers a vast world of mythical creatures, dungeons, and epic battles. As you progress through the game, you will encounter various challenges that require you to have the best gear to overcome them.

However, honing your gear can seem like an intimidating task. With tons of equipment to choose from, it can be challenging to know which items to hone and which ones to leave out. Thankfully, this ultimate gear honing guide provides you with tips and tricks to hone your gear perfectly and know precisely when to stop!

1. Understanding Gear Honing

To hone your gear, you need to understand the gear hone system. Hone is a process where you refine and strengthen your gear by using Enhancement Stones. These Enhancement Stones increase the gear's stats, making it more powerful and effective.

2. Finding the Right Gear to Hone

The first step in honing your gear is finding the proper gear to hone. Not all gear is equal. Some gear may have more potential than others. To find the right gear to hone, look for gear with high potential stats that are necessary for your character's build.

3. Upgrade Your Gear Before Honing

Before honing your gear, ensure that it's upgraded to its maximum level. Upgrading your gear unlocks additional stat bonuses that will increase the effectiveness of the gear. Additionally, upgrading your gear will reduce the number of Enhancement Stones needed to hone it.

4. Know When to Stop

Knowing when to stop honing your gear is vital. Although honing your gear is a great way to increase its power and effectiveness, over-honing your gear can be detrimental. Over-honing your gear means wasting your resources, including Enhancement Stones and gold, thus stunting your progress in the game.

5. Utilize Statistics & Probability

Finally, utilize statistics and probability when honing your gear. Before honing, ask yourself these questions:

- What's the chance of success for each Enhancement Stone used?
- What's the probability of getting a better stat roll?
- How many Enhancement Stones should I use before stopping?

Knowing the answers to these questions will help you make informed decisions when honing your gear.

In conclusion, honing your gear is an integral part of advancing in Lost Ark. By following these ultimate tips and tricks, you can hone your gear perfectly and know precisely when to stop. Remember, understanding the gear hone system, finding the right gear to hone, upgrading your gear before honing, knowing when to stop, and utilizing statistics and probability are the key components to honing your gear perfectly in Lost Ark.

Lost Ark features a plethora of weapons and crafting materials as you explore Arkesia. As soon as you hit level 50, you will wonder what next. With great enemies, come greater weapons. Through gear honing, you can increase the item level for each of your weapons. But there are some prerequisites to hone your gear. Not to worry, here’s our guide on how to hone gear and when to stop honing gear in Lost Ark.
 
## How to Hone Gear in Lost Ark (Gear Honing)
 
- Before we get on to the process, honing gear simply means upgrading your weapons and gear.
 - You can unlock Gear honing by reaching level 50 and getting a 302 iLvl gear.
 - You can get the item level to 302 by completing the Chaos Dungeons.
 - Alternatively, you can also complete the Shushire questline to get an iLvl above 302 as a reward.
 - We suggest completing the Shushire questline as getting an iLvl above 302 from Chaos Dungeons is based on RNG. If you are having trouble, check out our guide on how to upgrade and increase your item level.
 - Then, all you need to do is head to the Gear honing NPCs that can be found in all the major cities.
 - As you interact with the NPC, it will open the Gear honing menu.
 - Now, for the upgrade part, you need several materials for gear honing.
 - For example, to upgrade your tier 1 gear, you need Harmony Shards.

 - Life Shards
 - Destruction Stones

 
### Tier 3 (iLvl 1302-)

 - Simple Orhea Fusion Materials
 - Honor Shards
 - Honor Leapstones
 - Great Honor Leapstones

 
There are also special items like Star’s breath (tier 1) that increase the success rate for the gear honing. For tier 2, the special items include Moon’s Breath. To increase the success rate for tier 3, items like Solar Grace, Solar Blessing, and Solar Protection work out. These can be obtained from completing Cube, purchasing from Mari’s shop, the auction house, completing chaos gates, events, and more. In addition to these methods, you can increase the success rate by getting the Tailoring books. You can get them by completing the Abyssal Dungeons or auction house.

### When to Stop Gear Honing in Lost Ark
 
You can stop honing or upgrading your gear once your item level reaches Tier 2 (above iLvl 600). That’s because it will unlock the Yorn questline. As you complete Chaos dungeons, your chances of getting gear above iLvl 802 also increase.
 
We suggest stopping for a while before your gear reaches iLvl above 1100. This will unlock the Punika questline. So, take your time and grind on a certain tier for a while before you upgrade or hone your gear further.
