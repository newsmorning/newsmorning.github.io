Title: Shocking Revelation: You've Been Wiring Your Ceiling Fan WRONG All Along - Here's how to do it RIGHT!

Introduction:

Ceiling fans are a necessity in most modern homes, especially during the hot summer months. They reduce energy costs by reducing the need for air conditioning and help to circulate cool air around a room. However, wiring a ceiling fan can be a challenging task, even for the most experienced DIY enthusiast. In this article, we will explore the common mistakes people make when wiring a ceiling fan and show you how to do it correctly.

Body:

1. Incorrect wiring of the fan blades:

The most common mistake people make when wiring a ceiling fan is incorrectly wiring the fan blades. The fan blades should be wired in the correct order and direction to ensure that the fan will work effectively. Each fan blade has a specific position, and it is essential to ensure that they are installed correctly.

2. Failure to correctly ground the fan:

Another common error when wiring a ceiling fan is failing to correctly ground the fan. Grounding is critical for electrical safety, and it is important to ensure that the fan is grounded correctly to avoid the risk of electrical shock or even a fire.

3. Wiring the fan and light kit together:

Another common mistake is wiring the fan and light kit together. In many cases, the fan and light kit should be wired separately, and it is important to read the manufacturer's instructions carefully to ensure that this is done correctly.

4. Incorrect installation of the fan mount:

Finally, one of the most significant mistakes people make when wiring a ceiling fan is incorrectly installing the fan mount. The fan mount should be securely anchored to the ceiling, and it is important to ensure that it is installed correctly as this can impact the safety and stability of the fan.

Conclusion:

Wiring a ceiling fan may seem like a complicated task, but it can be done easily with the right knowledge and tools. It is important to take the time to carefully read the manufacturer's instructions and ensure that you follow them closely. By avoiding the common mistakes outlined in this article, you can rest assured that your ceiling fan is wired correctly, and it will work effectively to keep you cool and comfortable during the hot summer months!

## Chosen Solution
 do not have a light fixture installed

 you're going to need the correct box mounted in the ceiling that can support the weight of the fan. You'll also need power run to it as well. I recommend for household purposes standard 12/2 romex. It's 12 awg wire which will handle the current adequately, and has neutral, ground, and power wires all together. Once power is run, preferably from a switch, make sure there is no current. Install the fan per instructions. The ground will either connect to a ground wire in the fan or to a ground screw (ground screws are always green), the neutral (white) wire will connect to the white from the fan, and the black (hot) wire will connect to same from fan. If installing a remote then it'll be a bit different as you'll hook those up to the remote receiver, and then the different wires to the fan/light.
