Lenovo A7 50 A3500 is not new in the market. This tablet was released in 2014 and had decent specs at that time. But if you are still using this tablet and facing issues with booting it up, then be ready to find out the shocking truth why it won't turn on. Here are some of the reasons why your Lenovo A7 50 A3500 may not boot up and how to fix them.

**Battery Depletion**

The most common reason for any device not booting up is a dead battery. If your Lenovo A7 50 A3500 has not been charged for an extended period, then chances are its battery has died, and the device won't turn on. So, the first and foremost thing to do is to plug in the charger.

If the battery has completely depleted, it may take up to an hour for the device to charge and then turn on. In some cases, the battery may have been so drained that it’s not responding to the charge. If this is the case, you may need to consider replacing the battery before the device will turn on.

**Power Button Functionality**

Another common issue that can cause a Lenovo A7 50 A3500 not to boot up is a malfunctioning power button. If the power button is not working correctly, then the device will not turn on. Before considering further iPad troubleshooting, ensure that the power button is functioning correctly. Check if it's responding by pressing it multiple times. If the power button is faulty, consider getting it repaired professionally.

**Software Update Issues**

If your Lenovo A7 50 A3500 has been working excellently, and then suddenly, it won't boot up, the issue could be a software update that didn't install correctly. Sometimes, when updates are installed, they may cause conflicts with the tablet’s configuration.

To fix this issue, you can try to restore the device to its previous version. You can do this by booting the device while holding the volume and power button. Select the option to “Wipe Data/Factory Reset,” and this will erase any data on the device, including installed updates.

**Hardware Issues**

If none of the above solution works, then it's very likely there may be hardware issues with your device. This could be due to a malfunctioning circuit, broken screen, or other problems. It's best to take the device to a professional technician who can determine the cause of the issue and provide a solution.

In conclusion, various factors can cause Lenovo A7 50 A3500 not to boot up, ranging from a simple dead battery to varying hardware problems. Always ensure your tablet is in good working condition and properly maintained to enjoy its features to the fullest. And if the tablet refuses to function, try these Lenovo tablet troubleshooting solutions before going for extreme measures.


## Chosen Solution
 I have charged my lenovo tablet and pressed the reset button several times but it’s completely dead. It won’t show the charging sign or anything else. I have also tried to factory reset it from the tutorials here but it won’t even show up that menu. As I said completely dead. If anyone has any suggestions I’m all ears.

 There could be a number of reasons your tablet is dead. It could be the power adapter, power port, the battery, the screen or even the motherboard. You could pay to have it looked at and repaired, but this is a budget tablet and is not worth the time and money to get it back up and running. I would recommend looking into a new tablet.
