Title: You Won't Believe What's Happening! My Honda Accord is Revving Up and Down While in Idle - Find Out the Crazy Reason Why!

Introduction:

You might have experienced or heard about strange things happening to your car at one point or another. It could be the sound of the engine, the way it accelerates, or how it runs when idling. But imagine driving your Honda Accord, and suddenly, it starts revving up and down while idling. How do you feel? Shocked, confused, or anxious, you’ll probably start thinking what’s wrong with my car? Before you freak out, let's delve into the crazy reason why your Honda Accord is revving up and down while idling.

Body:

Now, there could be various reasons why your Honda Accord is acting up, but this article will focus on one culprit - the Idle Air Control Valve (IAC). The IAC valve is an essential component of the engine's air intake system that manages the amount of air that mixes with the fuel while idling. This valve directs the idle air around the throttle plate and allows the engine to run smoothly while stationary.

However, when the IAC valve starts malfunctioning, it can cause the engine to rev up and down while idling. Why does this happen? If the IAC valve is blocked or clogged with dirt or debris, it cannot control the airflow effectively, causing the engine to fluctuate between low and high rpm, hence the revving up and down.

The IAC valve can also malfunction if it's faulty, damaged, or worn out. If this happens, the valve will not send the correct signal to the engine's computer, resulting in an unstable idle speed, leading to engine stalls, rough idle, or increased fuel consumption.

So, what's the solution to this problem? The best course of action is to have a professional technician examine and replace the IAC valve if necessary. In some cases, cleaning the valve may solve the issue, but it's best to consult an expert to avoid guesswork and further damages to the engine.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, revving up and down while idling on your Honda Accord can be frustrating and worrying, but it shouldn't cause panic. The issue may be the IAC valve, which is a crucial component of the engine's air intake system. So if you experience this problem, don't hesitate to take your car to a professional technician and have it checked. Rest assured that with proper diagnosis and repair, your Honda Accord will be back to its smooth, steady performance in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 Keeps reving up and down

 As this is a fuel injected and not carburetted, there could be restrictions in one or more injectors. There could also be a vacuum leak somewhere.
The best solution (requires a mechanic with the correct software) is to connect to a computer and diagnose by checking what the different sensors are doing / telling, when the engine is idling and surging.
I mostly work on carburetted engines, so my fuel injection expertise is limited
