## Chosen Solution
 My Hero 5 black lcd broke and I need to replace it. Do you do it? I am in Brazil but my daughter has my camera. Sheâ€™s in Bloomington, Indiana.

 There are two screens, the front screen (black and white) and the back screen (bigger color display). Which one is broken?

 It's the back screen that's broken. Camera is working properly though.

 @jonasbrazil I do replace these, However some people get these confused for some reason. Just wanting to make sure we are on the same page is this the small lcd of the bigger lcd? FYI I am in Brazil, Indian also.
