Whether you want to enjoy a new rock album, watch Netflix with friends, or play your favorite game, the Windows 10 audio mixer sometimes fails to optimize the sound properly. Fortunately, there are apps that can help us get that extra volume boost we need. These apps are especially useful for quiet laptops with incorporated speakers that don’t simply allow you to turn the volume knob to 11.
 
A volume booster for Windows 11/10 will help you adjust, boost or cut the sound frequencies so you can enjoy the perfect audio. Sometimes it’s not about the volume, but about setting the strength of the bass, or filtering some sounds. This is when the booster apps can come in handy. They will allow you to tweak the sound delivery to your liking. If you don’t know where to begin searching, here’s our list of the best volume boosters for Windows. 
 
## 1. Equalizer APO
 
This app is an open-source product. It is a system-wide equalizer and it will allow you to adjust the sound output of your PC.

For example, you can download Peace Equalizer, which is specifically made as a graphical user interface for Equalizer APO. Besides being an open-source app, the Equalizer APO is completely free for all users.
