# Unlock the Secrets of Industrial Robotic Arms: What You Need to Know Before Investing in These Game-Changing Machines!

With the rapid advancement of technology, robotic arms have become an indispensable tool for the manufacturing industry. They have revolutionized the way products are built, with businesses experiencing exponential growth in efficiency and productivity. 

However, investing in industrial robotic arms is not a decision to be taken lightly. With the complexity of the machinery and the potential for costly errors, it’s crucial to have a deep understanding of the technology and its implications. Here are some important things you need to know before investing in these game-changing machines:

## What are Industrial Robotic Arms?

Industrial robotic arms are sophisticated machines that mimic human arm movements, allowing them to perform a variety of tasks in manufacturing environments. They are powered by electric motors and controlled by a computer or a programmable logic controller (PLC).

These machines are widely used in industries such as automotive, electronics, aerospace, and pharmaceuticals, where they help to achieve cost savings, higher productivity, and greater precision.

## Types of Industrial Robotic Arms

There are several types of industrial robotic arms, each designed for specific functions. Here are four common types:

1. Cartesian robotic arms: These robotic arms move along rectangular coordinates and are best suited for tasks requiring large payloads and precision, such as welding and painting cars.

2. Articulated robotic arms: These robotic arms have a series of rotary joints, allowing them to perform intricate, delicate tasks, such as assembling small electronics.

3. Delta robotic arms: These robotic arms use a system of interconnected rods and joints, allowing them to move quickly and precisely. They are commonly used in the food, pharmaceutical, and packaging industry.

4. SCARA robotic arms: These robotic arms have two parallel arms that can move horizontally and vertically simultaneously. They are best suited for assembly or inspection tasks that require high speed and precision.

## Benefits of Investing in Industrial Robotic Arms

Investing in industrial robotic arms offers numerous benefits for businesses in the manufacturing industry. Here are a few of them:

1. Increased production: Industrial robotic arms work continuously and without fatigue, significantly increasing production rates and efficiency.

2. Improved quality: The accuracy and precision of robotic arms result in a consistent, high-quality product.

3. Reduced costs: As robots can work round the clock, the cost per unit of production decreases, ultimately resulting in lower overhead costs.

4. Enhanced safety: Using robots in hazardous or dangerous environments reduces the risk of injury to workers.

5. Increased flexibility: Robotic arms can perform different tasks without the need for significant retooling, giving businesses greater flexibility in adapting to changing production demands.

## Factors to Consider Before Investing in Industrial Robotic Arms

Although industrial robotic arms offer numerous benefits, it's important to consider several factors before proceeding with an investment:

1. Cost: Industrial robotic arms can be expensive, with prices ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

2. Application: Consider the specific applications of the robotic arm, ensuring it will provide the desired level of efficiency and production increase.

3. Operator skills: The effectiveness of the robotic arm relies on the skills of the operator or programmer. Investing in training for your employees will maximize the return on your investment.

4. Maintenance and repair: Industrial robotic arms require regular maintenance and occasional repairs, which may require specialized skills.

## Conclusion

Industrial robotic arms are game-changing machines in the manufacturing industry, offering numerous benefits such as increased production rates and improved product quality. However, it's important to consider several factors before investing in one, such as the cost, application, and the skills of the operator or programmer. Proper training of employees, regular maintenance, and repair, are also important factors to consider.

Investing in industrial robotic arms may seem like a significant financial commitment, but the benefits of the technology make it a wise investment for businesses in the manufacturing industry.

Industrial Robotic Arms have been in the factory floor for the last fifty years since the first robot was manufactured. Over the years, they have changed in appearance and functionality but they still remain an integral part for any manufacturing entity that wants to increase efficiency and productivity.
 
As the need for the industrial robot arm has grown, the number of tasks that can be completed by it have also grown. As a result, different robot arms have been made that can competently execute different tasks depending on the main reason a factory needs a robot arm.
 
Here are the factors that factories need to consider when acquiring an industrial robot arm.
 
## Industrial Robotic Arms Kinematics
 
Kinematics refers to the way the robot arm moves in the course of completing its tasks. Broadly, kinematics refers to the structure of the industrial arm, axis and joints of the industrial arm and finally its movement.
 
When considering this factor, there are different types of industrial arms an organization can acquire. First is the Cartesian which moves on the vertical diagonal and horizontal axis and needs a large working area. Secondly is the cylindrical robot arm which consists of a base and a rotating cylindrical tube. The other is the spherical robot arm which allows flexibility in movement and the fourth is the articulated arm robot which closely imitates the human form providing large degrees of freedom to their movement and working area.
 
## Weight of the robot arm
 
This is another factor that factories acquiring an industrial arm should consider. The weight of the robot arm comprises of several factors to check out. Most important is the size of the robot. Will the robot fit in the available space that the organization currently operates from? Will it fit into the current production system? These questions will help your organization buy the correct industrial robot arm.
 
## Control system
 
This refers to the running of the robot arm. It refers to the programming of the robotic arm in how it executes assigned tasks. The programming provides for the robotic arm the arm the steps to follow for it to complete a certain task and what position to assume when it completes the task. Control systems determine the preciseness of the repeatability of the industrial robotic arm.
 
## Repeatability 
 
Repeatability refers to the ability of the industrial arm to get back to its original position once it completes a task. Industrial robotic arms are usually calibrated to have small margins of error when going back to begin another task. Larger margins of error for their repeatability may lead to the robotic arm performing the wrong task. That is why it is important to ensure that before acquiring a robotic arm, you find out its control system which will determine the accuracy of its repeatability.
 
Here the lower the margins of repeatability the better.
 
## Industrial Robotic Arms maximum payload capacity
 
How heavy a load can the robotic arm you want to acquire carry? IS the robotic arm strong enough to bear the weight of the products produced by your organization? Will the end effector be strong enough to hold your product as it executes tasks assigned to it?
 
These questions will help you choose the best robotic arm for your organization.
 
## Reach
 
How far can your robotic arm go? Will it comfortably utilize the working area set aside for it? It is important to find out the reach of the robotic arm prior to purchasing it to ensure that it will be a good fit for your organization. This will help increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your production process.
 
## Drive
 
Drive refers to the functionality of your industrial robotic arm. There are three types of drive for the robotic arm; electric which means that your robotic arm is powered by electricity. Second, is a pneumatic drive system which refers to machines being powered by compressed air while the third drive system for your robotic arm is the hydraulic drive system which refers to hydraulic pressure being used to power your robotic arm. Most robotic arms use the hydraulic drive system.
