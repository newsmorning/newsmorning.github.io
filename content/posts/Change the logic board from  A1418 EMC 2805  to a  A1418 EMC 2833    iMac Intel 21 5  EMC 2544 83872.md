# You Won't Believe How One Simple Change to Your iMac Can Improve Performance!

If you’re one of the millions of people who use an iMac on a regular basis, then you know just how important it is to ensure that your machine is running at its best. Whether you’re using your iMac for work, entertainment or anything in between, performance is key, and any slowdown can seriously hamper your productivity.

As it turns out, there’s one simple change that you can make to your iMac that can significantly improve its performance, and it’s something that you may not have considered before.

So what is this magical change? It’s simple: upgrading the RAM.

RAM, or random-access memory, is a crucial component of any computer. It’s responsible for storing data that your computer needs to access quickly, such as the files that your programs are currently running or your internet browser’s temporary files.

The more RAM your computer has, the more data it can store in this short-term storage. And the more data your computer can store in RAM, the faster it can access that data.

So why does upgrading your iMac’s RAM make such a big difference? For one, it can help your computer run more smoothly when you have multiple programs open at once. If your iMac doesn’t have enough RAM to store all of the data it needs for these programs, it will start using your hard drive as a temporary storage space. This can slow down your computer significantly, since accessing data on a hard drive is much slower than accessing it on RAM.

Upgrading your iMac’s RAM can also help speed up the loading of larger files, such as high-resolution images or video files. Since your iMac can store more data in RAM, it can load these large files quicker.

Thankfully, upgrading your iMac’s RAM is a simple process that you can do yourself in just a few minutes. First, you’ll need to determine which type of RAM your iMac uses. This is typically listed in your computer’s documentation, but you can also find this information by going to the “About This Mac” section of your computer’s settings and clicking on the “Memory” tab.

Once you know which type of RAM you need, you can purchase the RAM sticks online or from a local electronics retailer. The amount of RAM you need will depend on your iMac’s capabilities; newer iMacs generally support up to 64GB of RAM, while older models may only be able to handle 16GB or less.

The actual process of installing the RAM is straightforward. Simply turn off your iMac and unplug it, then remove the back cover to expose the RAM slots. Carefully insert the new RAM sticks, making sure to line up the notches correctly, and then replace the back cover.

And that’s it! Once you’ve upgraded your iMac’s RAM, you should notice a significant improvement in performance, especially if you’re running memory-intensive programs or working with large files.

In conclusion, if you’re looking to improve your iMac’s performance, consider upgrading its RAM. It’s a simple process that can make a big difference, and it’s well worth the minor investment in time and money. Happy computing!

## Chosen Solution
 I have a iMac 21.5" with a faulty  (A1418 EMC2805) logic board.
I've been offered a iMac with a broken screen/case, is it possible to change the logic board  (A1418 EMC2833).
thanks mark

 Yes.  The A1418 is the model number.  The EMC differentiates between different configurations.

 The 2805 board is shorter and the chassis mount are in a different position.
These can be snapped off and glued to the desired position.
The SD C4 display panel has a different back light cable but will fit.
We have had issues withe C4 panel not working with other boards
