Is Your LG TV a Dud? 

You Won't Believe What Happens As Soon As You Turn It On!

Are you the proud owner of an LG TV? Does it seem like you've been experiencing a lot of trouble with it lately? If so, you're not alone. Many LG TV users have reported issues that seem to arise as soon as they turn on their TV. In this article, we'll explore some of the problems LG TV users have faced and what might be causing them.

One of the most common issues reported by LG TV users is the sudden appearance of lines or other distortions on the screen once the TV is turned on. This can be a frustrating problem, especially if you've spent a lot of money on your TV. So what causes these lines and distortions? There are several possibilities.

One possibility is that there is something wrong with the TV's signal processing. Signal processing refers to the way the TV processes the signals it receives from external devices such as cable boxes and gaming consoles. If the TV's signal processing is faulty, it can create visual distortions on the screen.

Another possibility is that there is something wrong with the TV's display panel. The display panel is the part of the TV that produces the images you see on the screen. If there is a problem with the display panel, it can cause lines, distortions, and other visual anomalies.

Yet another possibility is that there is something wrong with the backlighting system. The backlighting system is what illuminates the display panel and allows you to see the images on the screen. If there is a problem with the backlighting system, it can cause flickering, dimness, and other visual issues.

So, what can you do if you're experiencing any of these issues? The first step is to try resetting your TV. This can often clear up minor issues and get your TV back to working properly. To reset your LG TV, you'll need to unplug it from the power outlet and wait for at least 30 seconds. Then, plug it back in and turn it on.

If resetting your TV doesn't work, you may need to get professional assistance. Contact LG customer service or a reputable TV repair company to diagnose and fix the issue. Depending on the nature of the problem, your TV may need to be repaired or replaced.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing issues with your LG TV as soon as you turn it on, there could be several reasons why. The best course of action is to try resetting your TV and, if that doesn't work, seek professional assistance. Don't give up on your TV just yet â€“ there may be a solution to the problem.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello, as of yesterday my LG 43uk6470plc TV has an issue. I read some similar posts but none that match the exact issue I have.
After turning it on, there is a fade out to black from left to right in about one second, just long enough to show the channel number in the upper right cornerThe backlight is still on, no image can be seen with a flashlightAudio still worksThe red LED on the bottom blinks a few times on start-up
I've left the power off over night which didn't make a difference. Today I popped off the back and I'm not seeing much out of the ordinary (no blown capacitors) but there is some yellow substance which I assume is glue or something but I'm not sure
Does this description ring any bells for anyone? I'm not very experienced with hardware issues myself, any suggestions are appreciated!

 @rvdl you do want to find out the exact number of blinks for the power led. That is an error code that will help with the troubleshooting. So, count it. This could be a mainboard issue. Measure the voltages going from the connectors on the mainboard and check against the legend printed on the board for that connector. Make sure that you have all the right voltages. Let us know what you find out.

 hard to tell from the picture angle, but C201, C202, & C203 look like they might be suspect bad. The tops should look like C205. They look a little convex instead of flat to concave.
