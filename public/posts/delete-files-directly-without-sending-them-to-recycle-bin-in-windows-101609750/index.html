Simply, you have to disable the Recycle Bin feature from your computer.\nNow you may be thinking, without the Recycle Bin, what if I accidentally delete an essential file or folder? Well don’t worry, because even after the Recycle Bin feature is disabled, your deleted files and folders are not permanently erased from your computer. They are stored in a folder named “$Recycle.bin”. This folder can be accessed by typing “$Recycle.bin” in the address bar of your File Explorer.\nSo, how do you disable the Recycle Bin feature on Windows 10?
