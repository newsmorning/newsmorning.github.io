# You Won't Believe How Quickly the iPod Touch 6th Generation Charges… But be Warned, it Dies Even Faster!

The iPod Touch 6th generation is a fantastic device that allows users to enjoy listening to music, playing games, browsing the web, and much more. One of the best features of the iPod Touch 6th generation is its fast charging time. This feature has completely revolutionized the way we think about charging our devices. However, with a fast charging time comes a shorter battery life. In this article, we'll discuss the fast charging time of the iPod Touch 6th generation, and the downside of such a feature.

## The Lightning Fast Charging Time

The iPod Touch 6th generation has a lightning-fast charging time. This feature is due to the device's powerful charging technology, which allows it to charge up to 80% in just an hour. This means that if you have a low battery, you can quickly give your iPod Touch 6th generation a significant boost in a relatively short amount of time.

If you're always in a hurry and find it frustrating to wait for your device to charge, then the iPod Touch 6th generation is perfect for you. Its fast charging time will allow you to spend more time enjoying your device and less time waiting for it to charge.

## The Downside of Fast Charging Time

However, there is a downside to having a fast charging time. The fast-charging technology used in the iPod Touch 6th generation is great, but it comes at the cost of shorter battery life. The device's battery drains quickly, which means you'll need to charge it more often than other devices with a longer battery life.

If you're an avid user of your iPod Touch 6th generation, then you'll need to have a charger with you almost all the time. This can be inconvenient for some people, especially if they're traveling or on the go. Additionally, the need to charge the device frequently can shorten the overall lifespan of the battery.

## In Conclusion

The fast charging time of the iPod Touch 6th generation is impressive, and it provides users with an excellent convenience. However, it comes at the cost of a shorter battery life. If you want to enjoy your iPod Touch 6th generation to the fullest, you'll need to have a charger with you almost all the time. Despite this, the device remains popular among users, and its fast-charging technology is still considered one of the best in the market.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey I have a iPod touch 6th gen come in for repair
anyways, this is the third one that came in wasn’t charging or turning on… so I decided to change the battery and re solder a new one in. It’ll charge very quickly and drain fast as well. I’m not sure if it’s the batteries I am getting off eBay or if something hardware is at fault on the logic board causing this issue. Is this a U2 IC Failure? Any shops that have this same problem it would be great if you could chime in with a Solution. It also recognizes with the computer and charges at 0.72 volts

 Try the battery that iFixit sells.

iFixit generally has decent quality batteries.

 ipods generally have a terrible battery life,
