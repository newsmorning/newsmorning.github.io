Is Your Macbook Pro 13 Suddenly Losing Power? You Won't Believe the Solution to the Battery Not Found Error!

If you are a Macbook Pro 13 owner, you may have experienced a sudden loss of power. It could be due to a battery not found error. This problem can be frustrating and might even lead you to think it's time to replace your computer. But before you spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a new device, there is a simple and cost-effective solution that you won't believe.

The Macbook Pro 13 is a reliable and powerful computer that is perfect for everyday use. However, it's not immune to technical glitches, and one of the most common issues is battery drain. One day, you may notice that your beloved device is losing power faster than usual. This can be worrying, especially if you depend on your computer for work or school.

If you are like most Macbook Pro 13 owners, you may assume that the battery is the problem. After all, batteries degrade over time, and yours might need a replacement. But what if we told you that the battery is not to blame?

The real culprit behind the battery not found error is the system management controller (SMC). The SMC is responsible for managing the power and thermal conditions of your device. When it malfunctions, your Macbook Pro 13 may not recognize the battery, leading to the error.

The good news is that fixing the SMC is a simple process and can be done at home. Follow these steps to reset the SMC on your Macbook Pro 13:

Step 1: Shut down your computer.

Step 2: Press and hold the Shift + Control + Option keys on the left side of the keyboard and the power button at the same time.

Step 3: Release all keys and the power button at the same time.

Step 4: Press the power button to turn on your computer.

That's it! Your SMC has been reset, and your battery not found error should be gone. You can go about your day without worrying about your battery draining quickly.

In conclusion, if your Macbook Pro 13 is suddenly losing power, don't assume that the battery is the problem. The real issue could be the system management controller (SMC), which can be easily fixed by resetting it. By following the simple steps above, you will save yourself money and frustration while extending the life of your beloved device.

## Chosen Solution
 before i placed the laptop in storage temporarily, i remove the battery and saw it charged up to 98%.
After 3 months the laptop will not start. i remove the battery and use the charger.
it started but when i replaced the battery back it wasn't recognized. i did the prams/smc etc but no battery. bought one tested it in a similar A1278, charged 100%. Used battery on that laptop only everything ok.
took the battery out and placed in my own, no battery, but i noticed before signing the battery seemed there, signed and the square with an X shows up, no battery detected.
again PRAM/SMC and all the hints i could fine every where but no battery.
i have replaced the magsafe-dc same thing. my research points to the charging circuit which i don't understand how it became defective.
does anybody know a repair shop  services for this at a reasonable price?

 usually  this happens to dell users, and it is usually because you store it in an environment which is hot andd the battery gradually loses charge until it becomes unusable, if a new battery does not work, then the cables on the inside get severed and they do not transport electricity. get a new battery or get a hair dryerr and heat them up a little, OR get a hot air gun if the hairdryer  is not productive

 thanks for the reply. i bought a new battery and as i already mentioned the new battery is 100% fine.
This new battery was fully tested in another identical MAC so the cables inside the battery are not the cause of the problem.
again i believe is one ic or another component in the charging circuit.
i wait until someone knows a repair place which is reasonable or it you know who is selling a good motherboard for this also at a good price let me know
