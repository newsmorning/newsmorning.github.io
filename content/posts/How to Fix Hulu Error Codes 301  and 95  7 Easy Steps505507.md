# Say Goodbye to Hulu Error Codes 301 and 95 with These 7 Simple Fixes!

If you're a fan of streaming your favorite TV shows and movies on Hulu, you may have encountered a frustrating error code or two. Two of the most common errors on Hulu are codes 301 and 95, which can interrupt your viewing experience and leave you feeling helpless. But fear not! Here are seven simple fixes you can try to say goodbye to these pesky Hulu error codes.

## 1. Restart Your Device

Sometimes the easiest fix is also the most effective. Before trying any other solution, simply restart the device you're using to access Hulu. Whether it's your phone, tablet, smart TV or gaming console, turning it off and then on again can often clear any temporary glitches causing the error.

## 2. Check for Updates

Another common cause of Hulu errors is outdated software. Make sure your device is running the latest version of its operating system and that you have the latest update of the Hulu app. You can check for updates in the device's settings or in the app store.

## 3. Clear Cache and Data

Clearing the cache and data of the Hulu app can solve error code 301 and 95 in some cases. This will reset the app to its default settings and may fix any corrupt files causing the error. To clear cache and data, go to the app's settings in your device's settings and then select the options to clear cache and data.

## 4. Disable VPN

Using a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass geo-restrictions and access Hulu from other countries is a common practice, but it can also cause error code 301 and 95. If you're using a VPN, disable it and try accessing Hulu again. If the error disappears, consider using a VPN that is compatible with Hulu's terms of service.

## 5. Check Your Internet Connection

A weak or unstable internet connection can also trigger Hulu errors. Make sure you have a stable internet connection with enough bandwidth to stream Hulu. You can also try restarting your router or modem to see if it improves the internet speed.

## 6. Disable Ad-Blocking Software

If you're using ad-blocking software, it could be interfering with Hulu's ability to stream content, leading to error code 301 or 95. Disabling your ad-blocker for Hulu may help solve the issue.

## 7. Contact Hulu Support

If none of the above fixes work, it's time to contact Hulu support. They have a dedicated team of experts who can help diagnose and fix technical issues. You can contact them by phone, email, or chat support.
