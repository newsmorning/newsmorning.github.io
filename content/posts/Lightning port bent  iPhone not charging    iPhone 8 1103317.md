As an iPhone 8 owner, one of the most annoying things that can happen is a faulty charger port. Not only does it make it nearly impossible to charge the device, but it also renders the phone useless. To make matters worse, a shocking discovery has recently come to light: many iPhone 8 charger ports are becoming bent, which can lead to even more severe damage.

If you're an iPhone 8 owner, keep reading to learn why this is happening and what you can do to fix it before it's too late.

### Why Are iPhone 8 Charger Ports Bending? 

The iPhone 8 is notorious for having a fragile design. While it may look sleek and sophisticated, it's not the most durable device on the market. Unfortunately, this poor design also extends to the charger port.

Many users have reported that the charger port becomes bent over time. Some speculate that this is due to the design of the lightning cable, which puts pressure on the port when it's plugged in. Others believe that it's simply a result of normal wear and tear.

Regardless of the reason, a bent charger port can quickly lead to other problems. For example, once the port is bent, the connection to the battery may become weak, which can cause the phone to drain quickly or fail to charge at all.

### How to Fix a Bent Charger Port on iPhone 8 

Luckily, there are some ways to fix a bent charger port on an iPhone 8. Here are a few solutions to try:

- Clean out the port: Sometimes, debris or lint can get stuck in the charger port, which can make it difficult to connect the charger properly. Use a toothbrush or a small, soft-bristled brush to gently clean out the port.

- Use a different cable: If you think the problem is with your cable and not your charger port, try using a new cable to see if that solves the issue.

- Use a toothpick or paperclip: If you can see that the port is bent, try using a toothpick or paperclip to gently straighten it out. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or damage the port further.

- Take it to a professional: If none of these solutions work, it may be time to take your iPhone 8 to a professional repair service. They can diagnose the problem and perform any necessary repairs to get your phone up and running again.

### How to Prevent a Bent Charger Port 

Preventing a bent charger port is all about being gentle with your phone. Here are a few tips to help you avoid this issue:

- Use a short cable: Using a shorter cable can reduce pressure on the charger port.

- Don't force it: If the charger won't go in or come out easily, don't force it. This can damage the port and cause it to become bent.

- Never yank the cable out: When you're unplugging your charger, be sure to pull it out gently. Yanking the cable out can damage the port.

- Use a case: A protective case can help cushion the phone and offer some additional protection against drops or impacts.

Final Thoughts 

If you're an iPhone 8 owner, a bent charger port is something you'll want to be aware of. While it's a frustrating issue, you don't have to let it render your device useless. By trying some of the solutions outlined above, you may be able to fix the problem yourself. And if not, a professional repair service can help get your phone back in working order.

## Chosen Solution
 My iPhone 8 is not charging. I noticed that the outer housing of the lightning port has bent. I have got the lightning port inside replaced , but the phone still doesn’t charge.

 You’ll need to either replace or rework the housing in order to get that working again, I imagine the cable isn’t connecting with the pins inside.
You can just use a wireless charger though…
