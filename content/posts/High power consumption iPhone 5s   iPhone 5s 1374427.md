The Shocking Truth About How Your iPhone 5S is Secretly Burning Through Your Electricity Bill!

Introduction

The iPhone 5s was released in 2013, and it is safe to say that it has since changed the way we communicate, work, and socialize. However, recent reports suggest that this device, along with other iPhones, could be burning through your electricity bill, without you knowing.

The Issue

Several users reported a sudden increase in their electricity bill, and upon further investigation, they found that their iPhones were responsible for the hike. According to experts, certain settings on the iPhone 5s were causing an excessive amount of battery drainage, even when the device was idle or not in use.

The Culprit

The primary factor responsible for the battery drain is the Background App Refresh feature. When enabled, this feature allows apps on your phone to use data and refresh content in the background. The problem is that some apps continue to update in the background, even when the phone is not connected to Wi-Fi or a data network, leading to significant battery drainage.

The Solution

If you suspect that your iPhone 5s is causing an unexpected hike in your electricity bill, you can take the following steps to rectify the issue:

1. Turn off Background App Refresh: Head to Settings > General > Background App Refresh, and toggle it off for all apps.

2. Disable Unnecessary Notifications: Go to Settings > Notifications, and turn off notifications for apps that you don't use frequently.

3. Monitor Battery Usage: Go to Settings > Battery, and check which apps are using the most battery. Close the apps that you are not using.

4. Turn on Low Power Mode: This mode reduces the amount of power that the iPhone 5s consumes, improving its battery life.

Conclusion

The iPhone 5s is a brilliant device that has revolutionized the way we communicate and function in society. However, as with any technology, it is not without its flaws. The Background App Refresh feature is a significant culprit in the sudden battery drainage experienced by many iPhone 5s users. Therefore, we urge you to take the necessary steps to rectify this issue, and save yourself from a shocking electricity bill.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I have an iphone 5s which has an unusually high power consumption and as a result the battery is draining considerably faster than it should. Using the app "battery health" that gives some data on power consumption, the phone consumes 140-160mA on airplane mode with all other apps closed and brightness at the lowest setting, while all other phones that i have tested (four iphones 5s) are consuming around 65-85 mA under the same conditions. Considerably higher power consumption can be observed with apps running and wifi or 4G on compared to the other phones.Recently i replaced the motherboard of one of the normally working phones with the one that shows the high power consumption and kept all other peripherals (Including screen) to check if the power consumption was caused by something outside the motherboard but showed the same result (140-160mA power consumption).  The last time I tried to let the battery drain completely and recharge it, it switched itself off at 7%, was left uncharged for two days and when conected to the charger it charged normally up to 100%. The phone does not get hot neither with use nor while charging.Does anybody have any idea what could be wrong?

 If you are on iOS 12 or 11 your suffering with the battery consumption is common like others.

 I have seen this before downgrade your ios if it is 12 or 11 it will use a lot of power, also turn off anything like background app refresh , automatic downloads, turn off bluetooth or wifi if your not using it
