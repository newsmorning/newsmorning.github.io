Gamers Beware: Lost Ark Region Is FINALLY Closed... Servers Locked Up Tight!

Lost Ark is a popular MMORPG game that originated from South Korea. Upon its release, it garnered a massive following and praise from the gaming community worldwide. However, for those of you who have yet to play this game, I am sorry to say that the servers are officially locked up tight.

Why is the Lost Ark region closed?

The game developers made an announcement in mid-June, stating that the game's beta test period would be coming to an end soon. Players were given until June 22, 2021, to save their characters' data. After the given deadline, the game servers were officially shut down. The reason given by the developers was that they needed time to review player feedback and make necessary improvements.

What does this mean for avid Lost Ark gamers?

This news may come as a disappointment to many players who were hoping to continue their progress within the game. The developers have, however, assured players that their data will be safe and will be available to retrieve when the game officially releases, which is yet to be confirmed.

Furthermore, the closure of the game's servers may be seen as both good and bad news for gamers. The temporary closing of Lost Ark means that the developers can have more time to work on the game and the necessary updates, ensuring a better gaming experience for players when it is finally released.

What to expect from Lost Ark upon its official release?

Lost Ark's official release date is yet to be announced, but gamers can expect several updates once the game is reopened. The developers have mentioned character progression improvements, a better user interface, and more balanced gameplay for all character classes. Additionally, the game developers have promised to make it easier for casual gamers to enjoy the game without forcing them to spend large sums of money on in-game purchases.

Conclusion 

In conclusion, the closure of the Lost Ark region may be saddening news for many players. The game had amassed a considerable following, but the development team needed time to work on the game’s shortcomings. Nonetheless, Lost Ark enthusiasts have been promised that their progress and characters would be safe and available to retrieve when the game comes back. It's an exciting time for gamers as a better version of Lost Ark is soon to be up for grabs. Are you looking forward to Lost Ark's official release? Get ready to level up!

Lost Ark has plenty of servers that players can join, some are even language specific (majorly). On some days, if you try to play the game and you come across the Selected Region is closed message or see servers locked in Lost Ark, you might get confused. Here’s what it means and what you can do about it.
 
## Lost Ark Selected Region is Closed Error Meaning
 
When you get the Region closed message in Lost Ark, it’s due to the servers being down for maintenance. During this period, you won’t be able to connect to the server and play the game – you must wait until the servers are back up.

### When will the servers be back up online?
 
To check the current Lost Ark server status, you need to either follow the official Twitter account, head over to the official page, or check the forums. You will get up-to-date information on these sources, especially on the official status page where all regions and server names are mentioned. Moreover, to know the duration of the maintenance period, visit the official forum and the information will be shared under the Official News section along with timings of downtime.
 
In case you feel like the problem is on your end, you can restart your PC and reset your router. Check your internet speed and if it’s stable or intermittent. If that doesn’t solve it and your friends are also having similar issues, the problems are from the end of the developers.
 
## Lost Ark Servers Locked Meaning
 
As soon as the game launched NA and EU regions, some servers are already getting more popular than others. This could be due to having the majority speakers of a certain language being on one server, or the server being a favorite of a famous streamer. So, when you see people talking about ‘servers being locked’ in Lost Ark, this is because the developers have locked certain servers so that the players can try out the less-popular ones. They will have a shorter queue and you can play there whenever the popular servers are overloaded, especially during peak hours.
 
Do remember that you cannot transfer your characters across servers and you have to create new ones on a new server and level it up. So, keep this in mind while playing or simply wait until the developers unlock servers.
