Title: Is Facebook Spying on You? Discover These 9 Tips for Ultimate Online Privacy!

Introduction:

The rise of social media platforms like Facebook has revolutionized the way we connect with people, share ideas and stay updated with the latest news and events. However, this convenience comes with a trade-off of sacrificing our online privacy. With growing concerns over data breaches, cyber bullying, identity theft and government surveillance, it's essential to take control of your online security and safeguard your personal information from snooping eyes. In this article, we'll discuss if Facebook is spying on you and provide you with nine practical tips for ultimate online privacy.

Section 1: Is Facebook Spying on You?

According to a recent survey, a shocking 79% of Americans are concerned about how tech companies like Facebook and Google are collecting and using their personal data. While Facebook claims to care about user privacy and has implemented various measures to protect it, there are still some ways the company can spy on you:

1. Facebook tracks your location: Facebook uses your smartphone's location services to track your whereabouts and suggest location-based content like nearby events or friends. However, this also means Facebook knows your exact location at all times, which can be a security risk.

2. Facebook listens to your conversations: Conspiracy theories aside, there is evidence that Facebook's mobile app can access your smartphone's microphone to listen to your conversations and serve you personalized ads based on what you say.

3. Facebook collects your browsing history: Facebook tracks your online activity through its social plugins and cookies installed on other websites, ensuring that it knows your likes, dislikes and interests.

Section 2: 9 Tips for Ultimate Online Privacy

Now that we know how Facebook can potentially spy on us let's explore nine tips for ultimate online privacy that you can implement today.

1. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN encrypts your Internet traffic and masks your IP address, making it harder for third parties, including Facebook, to track your online activity.

2. Use Facebook in a private browser window: Using Facebook in a private browsing window or incognito mode prevents Facebook from collecting data on your browsing activity.

3. Check your privacy settings: Review your Facebook privacy settings and customize them to fit your preferences, so Facebook only shares the information you want to be shared.

4. Disable location tracking: Turn off Facebook's location tracking services on your smartphone's settings, or deny its access to it all together.

5. Use two-factor authentication: Enable two-factor authentication to protect your Facebook account from unauthorized access.

6. Limit third-party app access: Be careful when granting Facebook access to other apps and services, as this can open the door to more personal data collection.

7. Log off Facebook after use: Log out of your Facebook account after every use to avoid cookies tracking your activity across different websites.

8. Use strong passwords: Create strong and unique passwords and avoid using the same password across different accounts.

9. Use two-factor authentication: Secure your internet connection with a strong and reliable password.

Conclusion:

While it's challenging to escape social media altogether, it's essential to take control of your online privacy and safeguard your personal information from prying eyes. By following these nine tips, you can reduce the chances of Facebook spying on you and protect your data from cyber threats, identity theft, and other privacy concerns. Remember, once your data is out there, you can't take it back, so it's better to be safe than sorry!

Staying private on Facebook is important. It’s
the biggest social media site around, and billions of people worldwide have
access to your information if it’s public.
 
If you’re not sure how to navigate the privacy
settings or what they all mean, accidentally posting something you wanted to
remain hidden, or sharing the wrong item, becomes way too easy.
 
Below are several tips and reminders that you
can take advantage of to stay private on Facebook and regain control over what
the internet knows about you.
 

 
## Review Your Activity Log
 
Activity Log is an area of Facebook that shows
all the different things you’ve been doing recently. What you liked, which
images you uploaded, the events you engaged in, your comments, etc. This is a
central hub that you should monitor frequently if you want a recap of what
others are seeing about you.
 
To get there, select the arrow at the very top
right corner of Facebook, and choose Activity
Log.
 
## Post to Specific Friends Only
 
Be aware of who you share things with on
Facebook. When you post something, don’t just choose the public option unless
you’re absolutely sure that you want literally anyone who stumbles on your
profile to see the post. 
 
Instead, choose Friends or Specific friends to limit the post’s visibility. You can hide your Facebook post from certain people by selecting the button under the text box; it’s most likely called Friends.
 
## Hide Your Online Status
 
Chat is built-in to Facebook, and can let all
your friends know whether you’re online. In fact, it’s an easy way for anyone
to see when you’re on your computer or phone at any given time, because let’s
face it, you’re probably on Facebook, too.
 
If you don’t like others knowing when you’re browsing Facebook, hide your Facebook online status by restricting it to just certain friends or going invisible to everyone. You can manage your visibility in Facebook chat from the sidebar; select the gear icon and then choose Turn Off Active Status.
 
## Restrict Who Can See Your Friends List
 
Your friends might not mind being publicly
visible on your Facebook profile, but if you like to stay private on Facebook,
they’re the first that should go. Fortunately, you don’t have to delete your
Facebook friends just to hide them.
 
Go to Privacy
in the settings of your account to find the option to change who can see your
list of friends. Change it to certain people only or limit its visibility to
just you. Now, anyone who visits your profile, whether they’re a Facebook
friend or not, won’t be able to snoop through who you’ve added on Facebook.
 
## Disable Reverse Email and Number Searches
 
If someone knows your email address or phone
number that you signed up for Facebook with, they can find your profile through
a simple Facebook search. This is true even if your phone number and email
address aren’t even visible on Facebook!
 
To disable these functions, open Privacy from settings and hit the Edit link to the right of both of these
items: Who can look you up using the
email address you provided? and Who
can look you up using the phone number you provided?. Change them to Only me or pick select friends that you
trust so that only they can do this kind of search.
 
## Stop Search Engines From Listing Your Profile
 
Anyone looking up your name and location on
Google or another search engine can most likely find your Facebook profile. It
really doesn’t take much. Fortunately, you can prevent your Facebook profile
from showing up in search engines with a single change in the settings.
 
In Privacy,
select Edit next to Do you want search engines outside of
Facebook to link to your profile?, and then uncheck the box. Confirm with
the Turn Off button.
 
## Limit Tags That Other Friends Can See
 
Facebook is all about being social, but you
still have lots of control over how social you want to be. One example is the
option to restrict who can see what other people post on your page. 
 
Some people like to send private messages
directly onto public timelines. If you don’t like your other friends seeing
such posts, you can disable that function from Timeline and Tagging. Edit the Who
can see what others post on your timeline? option to set up a limit.
 
## Stop Letting Anyone Add Things to Your Timeline
 
One really annoying thing that you might have
happening on Facebook is that your friends can clutter up your timeline by
tagging you in all sorts of things, maybe even pictures or videos you don’t
want others to associate with you.
 
The way around this is to force Facebook to
make you review each and every post before they get added to your timeline. In Timeline and Tagging, edit the item
called Review posts you’re tagged in
before the post appears on your timeline?. Choose Enabled.
 
## Delete Your Facebook Location History
 
If your mobile device is set up to give
Facebook access to your location, you might be shocked to find out that you can
actually go back in time to see where you were based on that information.
Facebook uses your location for things like ads, finding Wi-Fi, locating nearby
friends, etc.
 
Although all of this information is private, it’s still a bit unsettling to know that Facebook has retained it all. To delete your location data off of Facebook, open the Location History View page, press the three-dotted menu on the upper-right side, and select Delete all location history.
 
It might take a while to finish, but once the
page reloads, your location data will no longer be available and will restart
from today onward.
