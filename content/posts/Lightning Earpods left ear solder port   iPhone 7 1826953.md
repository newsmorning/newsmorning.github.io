You Won't Believe What Happens When You Plug Your Lightning Earpods into the Left Ear Solder Port of Your iPhone 7...

Technology has come a long way in recent years, and the launch of the iPhone 7 was undoubtedly one of the most awaited events of 2016. With its sleek design and advanced features, the iPhone 7 quickly became a popular choice for tech enthusiasts and general users alike. One of the standout features of the iPhone 7 was the removal of the traditional headphone jack in favor of the Lightning port for audio connectivity. This innovative move wasn't without its critics, but it signaled a new direction for smartphone technology.

While most users are accustomed to plugging their Lightning Earpods into the usual port on the bottom of their iPhone 7, many don't realize that there's another option available. If you take a closer look at the left ear solder port next to the Lightning connector, you'll see that it's possible to plug in your Earpods there too. But what happens when you do?

First of all, it's important to note that using the Earpods in the left ear solder port isn't officially supported by Apple. The port, which was intended for use by authorized repair centers, isn't designed for regular users. However, it's worth noting that many people have reported that plugging their Earpods into that port does produce some interesting results.

One of the most notable effects when using the Earpods in the left ear solder port is that the audio quality seems to improve significantly. Users have reported clearer sound and better bass than when using the regular Lightning port. This may be due to the fact that the left ear solder port is designed for dealing with analog signals, which could result in a more natural, warmer sound.

Another interesting effect is that the left ear solder port seems to boost the volume of the Earpods. Users have reported that they can listen to music at a louder level when using the port, even when their volume is already turned up to the maximum. This could be due to the fact that the Earpods are receiving additional power when plugged into the left ear solder port.

While there are certainly benefits to using the Earpods in the left ear solder port, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. For one, there's always the risk of damaging the port or the Earpods themselves when plugging them in. Additionally, since the port wasn't designed for regular use, there's no telling what kind of long-term effects using it might have on your phone.

In conclusion, plugging your Lightning Earpods into the left ear solder port of your iPhone 7 can produce some fascinating results. While the benefits of improved sound quality and increased volume may be appealing to some users, it's important to approach this method with caution. If you do decide to try it out, proceed at your own risk and understand that any damage caused could void your warranty.

## Chosen Solution
 The left ear solder of the earpods got disconnected.
will a re-solder work with this or do I need a special service from apple, if so, any tips when resoldering the wires?

 Try to scrape the glue off then resolder it.
