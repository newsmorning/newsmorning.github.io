# You Won't Believe the Secret Upgrade for Your MacBook Pro 13 in 2017 - Introducing the Revolutionary A1708 SSD Drive Adapter with Function Keys!

If you are a MacBook Pro 13 user, you know that the device is already a powerful machine that can handle most computing tasks with ease. However, if you are looking for a significant performance boost without having to buy a new laptop, you won't believe the secret upgrade that's available for your MacBook Pro 13 in 2017 – the A1708 SSD Drive Adapter with Function Keys!

## What's the A1708 SSD Drive Adapter?

The A1708 SSD Drive Adapter is a small accessory that can upgrade your MacBook Pro 13's storage capacity and performance without having to replace the entire machine. It's a small circuit board that plugs into the computer's logic board and allows you to use an M.2 NVMe SSD drive instead of the factory-installed SSD.

The M.2 NVMe SSD drive is a newer and faster storage technology that's commonly used in high-end laptops and gaming computers. When you install an NVMe SSD drive into your MacBook Pro 13, you can enjoy faster boot times, faster application launches, and smoother overall performance.

## What are the Function Keys?

If you own a 2016 or later MacBook Pro 13, you are probably familiar with the "Touch Bar" – a touchscreen strip that replaces the traditional function keys on the keyboard. While the Touch Bar is a useful tool for some users, others prefer the tactile feedback and convenience of traditional function keys.

The A1708 SSD Drive Adapter comes with a unique feature that allows you to use the traditional function keys with your MacBook Pro 13, even if it has a Touch Bar. The adapter includes a set of function keys that connect to the computer's USB-C port and mimic the function key commands.

With the function keys, you can quickly adjust the volume, screen brightness, and keyboard backlight, access mission control and launchpad, and perform other tasks without having to navigate through the Touch Bar menus.

## How to Install the A1708 SSD Drive Adapter with Function Keys?

Installing the A1708 SSD Drive Adapter with Function Keys is a straightforward process that requires only a few tools and some basic technical knowledge. The adapter comes with an installation manual that guides you through the process step by step.

If you're uncomfortable with opening up your computer, you can always take the adapter to a professional technician who can install it for you.

## Conclusion

If you're looking for a way to upgrade your MacBook Pro 13's performance and storage capacity without buying a new laptop, the A1708 SSD Drive Adapter with Function Keys is an excellent choice. It allows you to enjoy the benefits of NVMe SSD technology and the convenience of traditional function keys in one small accessory.

Whether you're a power user who demands the best performance from your computer or a casual user who wants a smoother experience, the A1708 SSD Drive Adapter with Function Keys is a revolutionary upgrade that's worth considering.
