Tips and Tricks Inside! If you’re playing Lost Ark, you know that Harmony Shards are a critical resource. These shards can be used to upgrade your gear, enhance your skills, and even open special chests. Unfortunately, they can be challenging to obtain, especially if you’re new to the game.\nBut fear not! With a few simple tips and tricks, you can start farming Harmony Shards in no time. Here’s how:\nTip #1: Prioritize Daily and Weekly Quests It may seem obvious, but completing daily and weekly quests is one of the most reliable ways to earn Harmony Shards. Every day, you’ll have access to “Raid Requests,” which offer a chance to earn shards. Completing these requests can net you between 10 and 30 shards.\nMeanwhile, weekly cross-server content, like Legend Raid or Tower of Infinity, will reward you with a good amount of Harmony Shards upon completion.\nTip #2: Farm Desolate Tomb Desolate Tomb is an excellent dungeon for farming Harmony Shards. It’s a 5-man dungeon that can be completed in around 20 minutes. Desolate Tomb will give you guaranteed Shards for every other run.\nBy farming this dungeon, you’ll have access to the boss drops and the double drops at the end. The double drop is an excellent opportunity to get more items and especially more Shards.\nTip #3: Use Trade Market to Your Advantage The Trade Market is an excellent way to earn Harmony Shards. You can buy rare items from other players and sell your duplicate items for Shards. If you’re lucky, you might even find a vendor who’s selling a significant number of Shards.\nTip #4: Enchant Items You Don’t Need Enchanting items in Lost Ark isn’t just for upgrading your gear. It can also be used to earn Harmony Shards. By using the items you don’t need to enchant your primary gear, you can quickly accumulate a lot of Shards.\nTip #5: Take Part in Events Events are another way to earn Harmony Shards. Lost Ark hosts numerous events throughout the year, and many of these offer rewards for players who can complete specific tasks or challenges. The rewards can vary, but they often include Shards.\nFinal Thoughts Harmony Shards are a valuable resource, and they’re essential for any player who wants to progress quickly in Lost Ark. By following these tips, you can begin farming Shards and take your gameplay to the next level. With a bit of effort and persistence, you’ll be surprised at how quickly you can accumulate them. So get out there, and start your Shard-farming journey today!\nAs an MMOARPG set in an extensive open-world, there are a ton of things you can do in Lost Ark. While you proceed with your journey in Arkesia, you will have to add a lot of upgrades to your gear and this is known as Gear Honing. It involves upgrading the XP points of your weapon and armor to increase its item level (iLvl). For this, you will need some materials to upgrade your gear. That’s where harmony shards come into the topic. Harmony shards are one of the gear honing materials you will need to upgrade your gear. So, here’s our guide on what are harmony shards and how to farm them in Lost Ark.\nHow to Get Harmony Shards in Lost Ark? Before we begin with how to get harmony shards, let’s start with understanding what are these materials first.\nWhat are Harmony Shards? Harmony shards are the materials used for upgrading your weapons and armor in Lost Ark. They cannot be dismantled and the maximum stack count for these shards are 999. You will need these materials to increase the XP of an item or equipment through Gear Honing. While perception shards increase your health, harmony shards upgrade the XP points of your gear. If you want to upgrade your weapons you will need Destruction stone fragments along with the shards. Similarly, you will need Guardian stone fragments to upgrade your armor through Gear honing. How to Farm Harmony Shards in Lost Ark? There are several ways to get harmony shards in Lost Ark. But the simplest way to get most of the harmony shards is by completing Chaos Dungeons.\nTo do that, you will have to be at least on level 50 or beyond along with an iLvl of 250. The daily limit to grind on Chaos Dungeon activities is two per day. You can either complete these activities in a normal mode of difficulty or hard mode for more shards.\nAlternatively, you can also acquire harmony shards by completing certain daily or weekly Una tasks that reward you with these shards.\nYou can also acquire harmony shards in exchange for pirate coins as they are easily obtainable by now. Head over to Simael Bloodstone or the Merchant ship right outside the harbor to buy harmony shards. If you are looking for pirate coins, you can grind on the island and reputation mini-quests.\nOne of the other ways to get harmony shards is completing subsequent levels or floors in the Tower challenge. Why floors? Because the level of difficulty increases as you climb the tower.\nIt is an endgame PvE challenge that involves climbing the tower as you face hordes of enemies with a ticking time limit. As you complete a floor, you will receive rewards and unlock the subsequent next floor. Tower challenges yield harmony shard pouches and are one of the best ways to farm more harmony shards.\nThat’s all on harmony shards in Lost Ark.
