Attention Chromebook Owners: Shocking News! CB Camera Cut Out - Replace It Now With These Easy Steps!

Chromebooks are the most affordable and reliable devices for students, professionals, and everyday users. They are easy to use, fast, and secure. The one thing that makes them stand out is their built-in camera, which allows you to attend online meetings, record videos, and take pictures. However, some users have reported that their Chromebook camera cut out. This means that they cannot use the camera, and it shows an error message. If you are facing this problem, don't worry; we have got you covered. In this article, we will show you how to replace the camera with these easy steps.

Step 1: Get a replacement camera

You can order a replacement camera online or from a local store. Make sure that you buy a compatible camera with your Chromebook model. Check the manufacturer's website for the exact model number and specifications. You can also contact the customer support team for assistance.

Step 2: Turn off your Chromebook.

Before you start, make sure that your Chromebook is turned off. Disconnect any cables and remove the battery if possible. This will prevent any damage to the device during the process.

Step 3: Remove the bezel and screws.

Locate the bezel around the camera on your Chromebook. Use a plastic tool or a flathead screwdriver to carefully remove the bezel from the device. You may need to remove some screws to access the camera. Keep them in a safe place, so you don't lose them.

Step 4: Remove the old camera.

Gently remove the camera from your Chromebook. Be careful not to damage any other components. If the camera is glued to the device, use a hairdryer or heat gun to soften the glue before removing it.

Step 5: Install the new camera.

Line up the new camera with the slot on your Chromebook. Insert it carefully, making sure that it sits firmly in place. Reattach any screws or bezels that you removed earlier.

Step 6: Test the camera.

Turn on your Chromebook and test the camera. Check if it works correctly by recording a video or taking a photo. If the camera still does not work, recheck the connections and the installation.

With these easy steps, you can replace the camera on your Chromebook and continue to use it without any interruptions. Remember to be careful during the process and follow the instructions carefully. If you are not confident, you can always seek professional help. Don't let a faulty camera ruin your Chromebook experience; replace it now and enjoy the endless possibilities.

## Chosen Solution
 Is there a step-by-step to replace camera and can I buy a new camera from you?

 Hi @sandybgya ,
Here’s a link to the ifixit HP Chromebook 11 G3 Camera Replacement guide.
Alternatively, here’s a link to the service manual for your Chromebook.
Scroll to p.43 to view the necessary pre-requisite steps and then the procedure to get to the camera /microphone module.
ifixit does not have this particular spare part.
If you search online using the part number 783088-001 only in the search box of your browser, you’ll get results of suppliers of the part.
Hopefully this is of some help.
