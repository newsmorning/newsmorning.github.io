Shocking! Motorola Moto G 1st Gen Charger Secrets Unveiled - You Won't Believe What's Causing My Charging Woes!

The Motorola Moto G 1st Gen is a popular device among smartphone users. It's reliable, affordable, and packs a punch. However, many Moto G users have been struggling with charging problems. This article will reveal some shocking secrets about the Moto G 1st Gen charger that might be causing your charging woes.

Before we dive into the causes of charging problems, let's take a look at the Moto G charger's specifications. The Moto G 1st Gen comes with a 5-watt charger that outputs 1.0A of current at 5V. The charger uses a micro-USB port, and the device is compatible with any charger that outputs 2.0A or less.

One of the most common charging problems that Moto G users face is a slow charging speed. Users report that the device takes longer than usual to charge, and sometimes it doesn't even charge at all. This slow charging speed might be caused by the use of third-party chargers that don't meet the device's power requirements.

Another common charging problem that users face is a charger that becomes hot while charging the device. This hot temperature might be caused by the charger's internal faults, such as short circuits or overloading. These faults might be caused by the use of a low-quality charger that doesn't meet the device's safety requirements.

Moreover, some Moto G users report that their device doesn't charge when they connect it to a computer's USB port. This problem might be caused by the computer's low power output or the device's power requirements. The Moto G 1st Gen charger requires a minimum of 1.0A of current at 5V to charge the device. If the computer's USB port doesn't output this amount of current, the device won't charge.

To avoid the above charging problems, we recommend that you use the original Moto G charger that comes with the device. If you don't have the original charger, make sure you purchase a charger that meets the device's power requirements. These include an output of 1.0A of current at 5V or higher.

In conclusion, the Moto G 1st Gen charger might be causing some of your charging woes. These might include slow charging speeds, hot temperatures, or problems with charging the device when connected to a computer's USB port. By using the device's original charger or a high-quality third-party charger that meets the device's power requirements, you can avoid these problems and keep your Moto G charged and ready to go.

## Chosen Solution
 My phone will  only charge if switched on first and then plugged in for charging. It switches itself on if plugged in first and won't charge, then if you remove the charger it  switches itself off.
My phone is stuck at between 1-5% charge (it seems to go up and down randomly each time it's on?) and won't turn on, it flashes the light like it does when the battery is dead. However, it will switch on if I plug the charger in but will not charge (however the battery seems to not go down either).  This basically means I can't use my phone unless it's plugged in. I have the same problem with every charger I use and it doesn't matter whether it's plugged into a USB or the mains.
Help?

 Sounds like you have a failing battery. Many devices will power on and be functional when connected to power such as a charger or PC, even when the battery is failing. Sounds as if your battery is no longer able to hold a charge. The big indicator for me is you can use it when connected to a charger but once removed it shuts right off. That's almost always a battery issue.
