## Chosen Solution
 I do not have the sanyo remote to change the source on my tv.

 Many TVs have a source button on the TV itself. It might be labeled “Input” or “Source.” If your TV doesn’t have a source input button and you don’t have the original TV remote, then you can either use a universal remote or the remote that came with another video device. Many DVD player, Blu-ray player, and AV Receiver remote controls will also control a TV. Check with your other devices’ owners manuals to see if one of them will also control your TV. You’ll need to set up the remote to work with your TV first. Some can be set up on the remove using a code and some set up the remove through on-screen menus. If all else fails, use a universal remote control. Sanyo makes TVs for a lot of other brands, so if you can’t find a Sanyo remote code that works with your TV then try the codes from other less-popular brands such as Fisher, Sylvania, and Westinghouse.
