For as long as I’ve known PC’s, installing an Operating System required an installation disk, usually a DVD or maybe a CD for the older Windows XP or early versions of Ubuntu. But all that changed when DVD drives started going the way of the floppy disk. Modern notebooks no longer come with this once very popular drive. The way to go is USB. The only sure way to install an operating system on a PC today is to use a bootable USB drive. There are tons of tools that will help you create these; here are our top picks.
 
## Rufus
 
Now, let’s create our first bootable UFD using Rufus, shall we? Follow these steps:
 
- Rufus  requires an account with admin access in order to make the necessary  changes to hardware. After authenticating, insert the USB flash drive  and launch Rufus. It will detect the drive almost immediately. Since  Rufus can handle various partition schemes and file structures, ensure  that the correct settings are set that match the UFD you’re going to  build (Figure A).Figure A Click  the optical drive button next to the Create a bootable disk using  checkbox, and you’ll be prompted to search for the ISO image to use (Figure B).Figure B When  using ISO images, Rufus will automatically modify the settings to best  match it. Once everything is set correctly, click the Start button to  begin the process. You’ll be prompted with a warning that all data on  the UFD will be destroyed. Click OK to proceed with the creation process  (Figure C).Figure C Depending  on the ISO image size, the process may take several minutes to  complete. For the log readout of each step in the process, click the Log  button to open a side window and save the output details (Figure D).Figure D The  longest part of the entire process is the file copy portion. This is  typically the last step and varies depending on file size/number of  files to copy (Figure E).Figure EWhen complete, double-check the external drive to verify the files were copied over (Figure F).Figure F

 
 	 	With the process completed, simply eject the UFD, insert it into 
the device you wish to install the OS on, and boot as you normally 
would. The days of carrying multiple CD/DVDs with you and dealing with 
lagging installs are drawing to a close with the ubiquitous use of USB 
drives—and the storage capacity can’t be beat.
 
## PowerISO
 
PowerISO is another very versatile tool on Windows that allows you to mount .iso files onto virtual drives and create bootable USB disks. To create bootable USB, follow these steps;
 
- Start PowerISO (v6.5 or newer version, download here).        Insert the USB drive you intend to boot from.        Choose the menu “Tools > Create Bootable USB     Drive”. The “Create Bootable USB Drive” dialog will popup. If you are using Windows Vista or above operating system, you need to confirm the UAC dialog to continue.            In “Create Bootable USB Drive” dialog, click     “…” button to open the iso file of Windows operating system.        Select the correct USB drive from the “Destination USB     Drive” list if multiple USB drives are connected to the computer.        Choose the proper writing method. “USB-HDD” is recommended.        Click “Start” button to start creating the bootable USB drive.      PowerISO will alert you that all data on the USB drive will be destroyed. Click “OK” to continue.The program will start writing USB drive, and showing the progress information. You should get the message “Writing USB drive completed successfully.” after the operation completes.

 
If no errors occurred in the above process, you should now be
  all set to setup Windows from USB drive!
