# Are Your Zoom Video Calls at Risk? Discover the Top 5 Safety Tips to Keep Hackers Out!

Video conferencing tools like Zoom have become incredibly popular in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. People are using Zoom to stay connected with colleagues, friends, and family members, and it has become an essential tool in the work-from-home era. However, as with any popular technology, Zoom has also become a target for malicious hackers.

To ensure that your video calls on Zoom are free from any security risks, you need to take some safety precautions. Here are the top 5 safety tips to follow:

##1. Use Strong Passwords

While it may seem obvious, using strong passwords is one of the most critical safety tips you can follow when using Zoom. Avoid using common words or phrases as passwords- instead, create complex, unique passphrases that include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

Additionally, make sure that you use different passwords for each meeting you organize, and if possible, enable two-factor authentication. This additional layer of protection ensures that even if someone guesses your password, they still can't log into your Zoom account or hijack your meetings.

##2. Use Waiting Rooms

Zoom waiting rooms enable you to see who is trying to join your meeting before you let them in. When enabled, participants are held in a virtual waiting room until you, the host, manually admit them to the meeting.

By using waiting rooms, you can avoid unexpected and malicious participants and ensure only the people you invited are allowed into your meeting.

##3. Do Not Share Personal Information

One common way that hackers gain access to Zoom accounts is through phishing emails that trick users into revealing their login details. Therefore, never share your login information or personal information like passwords or bank details over the Zoom chat, email, or any other digital communication channels.

##4. Use Encryption

Encryption is a security protocol that used to protect data during transmission. It ensures only authorized parties can read the data that is being transmitted. Zoom has built-in encryption capabilities that offer end-to-end security, ensuring your video calls are secure.

However, to ensure that your Zoom calls are indeed being encrypted, verify that the padlock icon is visible in the address bar of your browser.

##5. Keep Your Zoom App Updated

Zoom's developers regularly release updates that contain new security features and bug fixes. Making sure that your Zoom app is updated to the latest version is vital in ensuring maximum protection of your meetings.

Zoom will usually prompt you to update whenever there is a new version available. To update manually, click on your profile picture and then navigate to 'Check for Updates.'

In Conclusion

Zoom is a great tool that offers exceptional video-conferencing capabilities. However, with its rise in popularity, hackers are continually looking for ways to exploit the platform's vulnerabilities. By following these five safety tips, you can ensure the privacy and security of your video calls on Zoom. Stay safe and secure!
