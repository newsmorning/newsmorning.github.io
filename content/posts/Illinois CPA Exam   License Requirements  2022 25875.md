Title: You Won't Believe the Shocking Changes to Illinois CPA Exam License Requirements Coming in 2022!

Illinois is among the few states that have taken a new direction in the 2022 CPA exam license requirements. This change follows the state's pledge to ensure the qualification process for their Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) embraces the rapid changes in the industry. From July 1st, 2022, qualified candidates seeking certification can now enjoy the following:

Increased Accounting Education Requirements

To gain eligibility for the CPA exam, candidates must have completed an accredited Bachelor's or higher University degree. Under the new requirements, candidates must meet 150 credit hours, with at least 36 in accounting courses and 30 in business courses. Previously, the state board only required candidates to have 120 credit hours.

This change is a significant boost in CPA exam license requirements for Illinois. The move ensures the CPA certification process remains more rigorous; thus, Illinois CPAs will be more competent and knowledgeable when serving clients.

Experience Requirements

The new 2022 requirements come with yet another change in experience requirements. To receive certification, candidates must have completed two years of experience in accounting or a related field. One year must be gained in public accounting, with the other's source flexible.

Multiple-Choice Section Changes

The AICPA board, responsible for setting the CPA exam, is also making significant changes to the exam's multiple-choice section. The number of questions will reduce from 90 to 75. Furthermore, the questions in the multiple-choice task-based simulations (TBS) will now be integrated with the assignment questions. Previously, candidates would answer assignment-based questions separately.

This change intends to assess the CPA candidate's ability to apply their accounting knowledge to the situation. This change will be observed in the FAR (Financial Accounting and Reporting) section of the CPA exam in 2024.

Online Examinations

The Illinois State Government is embracing online services, and the CPA certification is aligning with these changes. Test centers will remain available; however, online proctored testing will also be an option, as long as the candidate meets specific requirements such as a reliable internet connection and a private space.

Conclusion

These changes to CPA exam license requirements in Illinois are aimed at ensuring Illinois CPA licensure remains among the most rigorous in the United States. The two-year work experience requirement gives potential clients the confidence that the CPAs have hands-on experience in the field. The increased credit hours in accounting and business courses arm CPAs with more knowledge to serve their clients.

Online proctoring of exams not only matches the technological changes in the world but also makes the CPA certification process more accessible. The multiple-choice section reform emphasizes the ability of the CPA candidates to apply their knowledge to the situation, ensuring they have practical accounting skills.

In conclusion, if you're looking forward to becoming a Certified Public Accountant in Illinois, these changes should be among your key considerations. It is essential to understand the additional requirements and prepare accordingly to guarantee your success in meeting the CPA exam license requirements.
