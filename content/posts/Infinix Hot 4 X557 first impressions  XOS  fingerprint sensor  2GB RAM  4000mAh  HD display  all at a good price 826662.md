Infinix Mobile recently launched in Uganda in partnership with Kilimall. The launch saw two Infinix devices hit the Uganda market; Infinix Note 3 and the Hot 4. Infinix has been popular in Nigeria and Kenya as an online, high end smartphone brand that targets the middle class. As a result, the phones are sold mostly online and Infinix as a brand does not have entry level devices.
 
We had time to review the Note 3 giving you the specs and price, first impressions and a complete review. We now bring you our first impressions with the Infinix Hot 4.

## Apps
 
The Hot 4 comes with all the basic apps you need to get started. Unfortunately, most of them will be needing updates. Among the pre-installed apps are the usual Google suite, basic Android apps like calculator, clock, radio etc. then the Infinix family of apps.
 
Infinix has built custom apps for their devices which include, Xcloud for cloud storage of your files (we aren’t sure how much space is given), Xmanager and Xpower are inbuilt phone optimisers that help you clean up and optimise your smartphones performance. Xshare is an equivalent of Xender or Flash share that allows 2 devices share files over WiFi. Xthemes helps you customise your device while Xweather provides localised weather forecasts, Xhide helps keep your device private, Xaccount and Xclub help you access a community of Infinix users who offer lots of useful information.
 
Other apps include an inbuilt manual, the Carlcare app to help you locate places you can get your device fixed or user guide and a compass.
 
## XOS
 
XOS is Infinix’s custom skin or call it operating system based on Android. XOS offers an easy to use interface with a host of relevant apps to make your experience satisfactory.
 
The device is highly customisable to suit the different needs of users. Most importantly there seems to be more regular OS updates to Infinix devices.
 
## Design
 
The Hot 4 comes in a basic but user friendly design. The design features a textured back for better grip, 5.5 display that’s not too big or too small – just enough. Both the power button and volume rockers were placed to the right while the charging port is at the bottom left. The earphone jack is at the top left and the speaker is at the back – bottom centre..
 
## Camera
 
The Hot 4 sports an 8MP rear shooter and a 5MP selfie camera. Even though basic, it met the bare minimums for a good enough camera performing better in full light than low light.
 
The Hot 4 camera had some interesting features though. For instance, the rear camera had a pro mode that allows you have more creative control over the settings. Also, the selfie camera has a flash and a wide angle mode for better selfies.
 
## Battery
 
The Hot 4 comes with a 4000 mAh battery which is amazing for a device of it’s size and budget.
 
However, we didn’t stay with the Hot 4 long enough to rate the battery but for the few days we had it, it performed well. Charging for between 60-90 minutes and lasting us about a day with moderate usage.
 
There are many inbuilt apps to help you make the best of your battery including the ultra power mode that could give you about 20minutes on 2% battery.
