# You Won't Believe the Shocking Reason Why the Apple Led Cinema Display 27's Backlight Won't Turn On - Uncover the Mystery of A1316 Now!

The Apple Led Cinema Display 27 has been known to be one of the best monitors in the market, but there have been reports of some users facing an issue with the display's backlight. If you're one of those who are facing the same problem, you might be curious to know what's causing it.

The answer lies in the A1316, the internal code of the Apple Led Cinema Display 27. This code refers to the display's power supply, which is prone to failure. The power supply contains capacitors that tend to fail due to prolonged use, excessive heat, or voltage fluctuations, which results in the backlight not turning on.

So, what's the solution?

The first thing you can try is to reset your display. Sometimes, the display could simply be in sleep mode or a low-power state, which is easy to rectify by resetting. You can do this by turning off your display, unplugging it from the power source, and plugging it back in.

If that doesn't work, you can try connecting the display to a different power outlet or a different computer to see if the issue persists. If it does, then the problem is most likely with the display's power supply, and you may need to repair or replace it.

Replacing the power supply can be a daunting task, but it's not impossible, and there are ways to do it yourself. First, you need to find a compatible power supply for your Apple Led Cinema Display 27. You can search online for the model number or approach an authorized service center to get one.

Once you have the new power supply, you'll need a few tools like a screwdriver, pliers, and a soldering iron to remove the faulty power supply and install the new one. If you're handy with electronic repairs, you can follow some online tutorials to guide you through the process. If not, it's best to let a professional handle it.

In conclusion, the A1316 code is the key to understanding why the Apple Led Cinema Display 27's backlight won't turn on. It's a common issue, but fortunately, it has a fix. If you're facing this problem, try resetting the display, connecting it to a different outlet, or a different computer. If none of that works, it's time to replace the power supply. With a little patience and DIY spirit, you can bring your display back to life.


## Chosen Solution
 I have an Apple A1316 27” Display (non-Thunderbolt) that is exhibiting a weird backlight issue.
When first plugged into a computer, when it receives a signal, the backlight flickers briefly but fails to stay on. Otherwise the monitor works fine (the computer thinks another monitor is attached, I can see that it is displaying using a flashlight).
I tried turning it’s brightness all the way down before connecting it. When connected, it flickered, then stayed on. So it seems that it can barely muster enough energy to turn the backlight on, but once it’s on, it’s fine. Other people have had issues with no backlight after a period of functionality, my issue seems to be kind of the opposite.
What should I start testing on this? I’m leery of the power supply, but I don’t know where I might begin.

 The fault was with the aging backlight strips that were drawing too much current. After replacement the monitor works fine.

 I believe that you should start with the power supply, as this would most likely be the issue. Or you should check the backlight filter in the device.
