## Chosen Solution
 Using an off the shelf Honeywell Lyric water leak detector (the one with WiFi) I want to replace the plug- in water sense cable with an active circuit that will detect a power loss (of 110vac from a receptacle) by tricking the detector to think it’s a leak, and send a message to my cell phone via WiFi.  It is to be used to make sure my separate Freezer in the garage does not lose power.   It is not for a total power loss.    Lyric was not in a Choose Device list, so I had to choose something!

 Have you looked at other devices which are designed to do this?
MOTOROLA Cellular-Connected MultiSensor Reports Temperature, Humidity, Water leaks, Acceleration/Earthquakes, Light Level, Power Loss, Model MC4000 This is what a few customers I support have used. Its the top end of protection! We used them in the wring closetsEaton Power Sensor Haven’t tried it but it maybe all you need.
I would look at something like these than try to re-design a device.

 maxdog303   the part to be hacked would be the signal cable. You would need to see if it get’s some signal from the Lyric or if it is a simple off/on sensor cable. If it is a simple off/on situation you could get this done with a relay board. First we have to determine how this cable works. Let’s see if I can find a unit to teardown and see what is going on with it. In the meantime can you use a meter and check the cable itself? How many contacts are on the cable where it connects to the unit?
