Desperate Search for the Missing Miter Saw Part: Plastic Blade Guard HAUNTS A Craftsman in 2017!

It was supposed to be a simple job. A quick fix around the house that would only take a few minutes. But as the saying goes, even the best-laid plans can go awry. And in this case, it was missing a tiny plastic blade guard that was haunting a craftsman.

The missing miter saw part had become the source of frustration for the craftsman in 2017. It had turned what was supposed to be a simple task into a desperate search for a replacement part that seemed impossible to find.

The miter saw had been a trusty tool for years. It had been used countless times without any issues, but suddenly, without warning, the plastic blade guard had disappeared. It was a small piece, measuring only a few inches in length, but its absence had brought the work of the craftsman to a standstill. Without the blade guard, it was impossible to use the saw safely and get the job done right.

The craftsman searched high and low, rummaging through drawers and boxes, hoping to find the missing miter saw part. He scoured the internet, contacted manufacturers, and visited hardware stores. He even reached out to other craftsmen, hoping that someone could help him find a replacement blade guard.

Days turned into weeks, and the craftsman's desperation grew. The missing miter saw part had become an obsession. The craftsman couldn't focus on anything else until he found the replacement part.

All the while, he couldn't help but wonder how such a small piece could cause so much chaos. He couldn't understand how a simple part had become the bane of his existence.

In the end, the craftsman never did find the replacement plastic blade guard. Instead, he had to purchase an entirely new miter saw, leaving the old broken one sitting in a corner, a constant reminder of the desperate search for the missing miter saw part in 2017.

The story of the missing miter saw part highlights the importance of even the smallest details. Something as seemingly insignificant as a plastic blade guard can have a significant impact on one's work. It's a reminder to always be prepared and to never underestimate the importance of quality tools and well-maintained equipment.

Perhaps most importantly, the story of the missing miter saw part serves as a cautionary tale to all craftsmen. It's a reminder that sometimes, despite our best efforts, things happen that are out of our control. But even in the face of adversity, we must persevere, never giving up on the search for a solution. As craftsmen, we must have the tenacity to overcome any challenge, no matter how big or small.

Thank you for responding. Here are two images with model number and image of parts diagram for this model.

 I guess parts for these disappeared with Sears stores. I need some parts also. I would be willing to pay you for yours before you toss it out. Thanks, Dom
