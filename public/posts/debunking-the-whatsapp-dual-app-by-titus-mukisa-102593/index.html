However, in this article, I’m going to expose the shocking truth about why you should never use the WhatsApp Dual App.\nAs a tech expert, I’ve conducted extensive research and tests on the WhatsApp Dual App and found some serious privacy and security issues that users need to be aware of. Here are three reasons why you should never use the WhatsApp Dual App:\nReason #1: No Encryption for the Second Account WhatsApp is known for end-to-end encryption, a security feature that ensures your messages and calls are protected from interception or decryption by anyone, including WhatsApp itself. However, the WhatsApp Dual App doesn’t provide end-to-end encryption for the second account. That means any messages or calls sent or received on that account are vulnerable to interception by hackers or snoops.\nReason #2: Risk of Losing Your Data All WhatsApp accounts are tied to a unique phone number, which means you need to have two separate phone numbers to use the WhatsApp Dual App. But what happens if you lose your phone? If you don’t have a backup of your second account, you can’t recover it because WhatsApp only allows one account per phone number. That means you will lose all your chats, contacts, media, and other important data associated with the second account.\nReason #3: Banned by WhatsApp Using the WhatsApp Dual App is a violation of WhatsApp’s terms of service. WhatsApp has the right to ban any user who violates its terms, including those who use third-party apps that modify or alter the official WhatsApp app. If WhatsApp detects that you’re using the WhatsApp Dual App, you risk getting banned from WhatsApp permanently without warning or notice. That means you will lose access to all your WhatsApp accounts, including the main one.\nIn conclusion, while the WhatsApp Dual App may seem like a convenient solution for managing multiple WhatsApp accounts, it’s not worth the risk to your privacy and security. Instead, you should use the official WhatsApp Business app or set up multiple user profiles on your device, which provides better privacy and security. Remember, it’s always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your personal data.\nUganda’s very own homegrown tech aficionado Titus Mukisa of Softek IT Consult broke the internet last week when Techjaja reported that he had released the WhatsApp Dual app. These tweaked versions-called Mods- of the world’s most popular messaging app have been floating around the internet ever since the release of WhatsApp in 2009 so this development shouldn’t have been an earth-shattering achievement in itself. Rather what should have been impressive about this all would be the fact that a Ugandan had managed to do it.\nBut here’s the thing: WhatsApp Dual app tweaked by Titus Mukisa didn’t work as it should. For us at least. Neither is it a real app for we couldn’t find anything special about the apk to prove Titus had done his magic. The real thing, GBWhatsApp V 3.9 on the other hand worked perfectly when we tested it. This site has a list of all the WhatsApp Mods (Modifications) which together fall under the category called ‘WhatsApp Dual’. Renaming an app doesn’t mean one has ‘tweaked’ it. Far from it.\nWe went ahead nonetheless and downloaded Titus Mukisa’s apk from Zippyshare.(The apk has since been pulled from Zippyshare) Curiosity killed the cat as people tend to say and we just couldn’t resist. The apk downloaded successfully on our testphones, HTC One V and Huawei Y330. However, we have nothing more to report on that matter for the installation refused to work on both smartphones as shown below.\nDid we not install it properly? Comment below and school us please.\nSpeaking of WhatsApp mods, special mention should go to what is undoubtedly the greatest WhatsApp Mod initially built by an XDA developer by the name of Rafalense. WhatsApp+ threatened to usurp WhatsApp’s dominance for a moment there, not until WhatsApp/Facebook put their foot down and mercilessly shut them down. Read this enlightening article on how one developer felt about the demise of this app.\nA mysterious Arab developer resurrected WhatsApp Plus (pictured above) and of course we had to download it. We asked the obvious question, ‘Does it come in Black?’ and YES it does. We dug deeper to understand the psyche of the developer but on not finding a single thing about him, panic set in. We imagined some sadistic hacker rigging our smartphones to detonate in our face so we hastily uninstalled the apk. Give it a spin if you dare.\nRelated ","wordCount":"840","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tina Ables"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/debunking-the-whatsapp-dual-app-by-titus-mukisa-102593/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>SHOCKING TRUTH: Why You Should NEVER Use The WhatsApp Dual App - Exposed By Tech Expert!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 9, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;840 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tina Ables</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#reason-1-no-encryption-for-the-second-account>Reason #1: No Encryption for the Second Account</a></li><li><a href=#reason-2-risk-of-losing-your-data>Reason #2: Risk of Losing Your Data</a></li><li><a href=#reason-3-banned-by-whatsapp>Reason #3: Banned by WhatsApp</a></li><li><a href=#related>Related</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>+++
