PS4 Owners Beware: Is Your Fan Connector Pad Damaged? Here's How to Fix it FAST!

If you're one of the millions of PlayStation 4 owners around the world, you know how frustrating it can be when your console starts acting up. Unfortunately, one common problem that many PS4 owners experience is a damaged fan connector pad. This small piece of hardware is crucial to keeping your console cool and preventing overheating, so it's important to address any damage to the connector pad as soon as possible.

So, what exactly is the fan connector pad? It's a small piece of metal that connects the fan to the motherboard of the PS4. This allows the fan to spin and keep the console cool during use. However, the fan connector pad is relatively fragile, and it's common for it to become damaged due to regular wear and tear or accidental damage.

If you're experiencing issues with your PS4 overheating or the fan not working correctly, there's a good chance that the fan connector pad is damaged. Fortunately, fixing it is a relatively straightforward process that you can do at home with just a few tools.

The first step is to open up your PS4 and locate the damaged fan connector pad. You can do this by removing the hard drive cover on the bottom of the console and using a screwdriver to unscrew the metal plate that covers the motherboard. Once you've done this, you should be able to see the fan connector pad clearly.

Next, you'll need to remove the damaged connector pad. You can do this by using a pair of pliers to grip the pad and gently pull it free from the motherboard. Be careful not to damage any other components while you're doing this.

Once you've removed the old fan connector pad, it's time to install the new one. You can purchase replacement fan connector pads online, and they're relatively inexpensive. Simply place the new pad onto the motherboard and press it firmly into place. You may need to use a pair of pliers to get it to snap into place securely.

Finally, reassemble your PS4 and power it on to make sure that the fan is working correctly. If everything is working as it should be, your console should stay cool during use.

In conclusion, a damaged fan connector pad is a common problem that many PS4 owners will experience at some point. However, with a little bit of know-how and some basic tools, you can fix it quickly and easily at home. Just be sure to take your time and be careful not to damage any other components while you're working. Happy gaming!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello everyone. I was recently tasked with repairing a broken HDMI connector on an old PS4 (1100 series). I believe to have fixed that but when I originally opened up the system I accidentally ripped the fan connector completely from the mother board. The soldering pads ended up completely burnt/ripped away because of the cheap quality equipment I was using after trying to hardwire the fan back on and just being out of practice for so long in addition to having a couple bad experiences with repairs the last couple times lol.
I hunkered down and got good quality equipment and went back at it but it still seems like I cannot reconnect the fan (black/brown/white wires) to the motherboard. To my knowledge these contacts give the fan 12v power, ground, and speed control(?) so if there is anywhere else I can tap into these lines I would be eternally grateful as I cannot find a solution online no matter where I look. This is my last hope, I have included a  picture. Thank you for your time it is much appreciated!
Im trying to fix the PS4 for a family member. So any help is greatly useful. Have a wonderful day.

 There should be traces on the other side of the board I can tap into if I can expose them. Haven't had time to try but that's my only course of action since nobody chimed in. Peace.
