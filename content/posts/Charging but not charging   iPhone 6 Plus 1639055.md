If you own an iPhone 6 Plus, you might have experienced the frustrating issue of your phone indicating that it's charging, but the battery percentage doesn't seem to increase. It's a common issue that many users face, and it can be indicative of a variety of underlying problems. In this article, we'll explore the causes of the "charging but not charging" problem and provide you with the surprising solution you need to know!

### The Causes of the "Charging But Not Charging" Issue

When your iPhone indicates that it's charging, but the battery percentage doesn't increase, it can be a sign of a charging port issue, a battery issue, or even a software issue.

#### Charging Port Issue

The charging port on your iPhone 6 Plus can become dirty or damaged, resulting in a poor connection between the charger and the phone. This can cause the charging indicator to appear, even though the phone isn't being charged.

#### Battery Issue

If your iPhone 6 Plus is several years old, the battery's capacity may have degraded to the point where it can no longer hold a charge adequately. A damaged battery can also result in the "charging but not charging" problem.

#### Software Issue

A software issue can also cause the charging problem. A software bug on your iPhone can prevent the battery from charging correctly or cause it to discharge rapidly.

### The Surprising Solution You Need to Know!

Regardless of what's causing the "charging but not charging" problem, there's one solution that can work in most cases. And that solution is a hard reset!

#### How to Hard Reset Your iPhone 6 Plus

Step 1: Press and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button simultaneously.

Step 2: Continue holding both buttons until the Apple logo appears. This may take 10 to 20 seconds.

Step 3: Release both buttons when the Apple logo appears. Your iPhone 6 Plus will restart.

After performing a hard reset, your iPhone 6 Plus should start charging correctly, and the battery percentage should start to increase. If the problem persists, you may need to try further troubleshooting, such as cleaning your charging port, replacing your battery or contacting Apple Support.

### Conclusion

The "charging but not charging" issue can be a source of frustration for many iPhone 6 Plus users. However, with the hard reset solution, you can fix this problem in most cases. Give it a try today and see if it works for you!

## Chosen Solution
 My iphone 6+ worked fine until its battery drains due to travel and i forgot my power bank, and Finally when i plugged it in, it charged 1% and now it doesnâ€™t move right there,  please help me get some answers, thanks

 Has the battery been replaced? If so may need to check the connection of the battery. I just had a customer bring their phone back after I changed their battery about 3 months ago with the same issue. Even with the plate over the connection it still managed to work loose somehow.  If not plug it in and try to turn it on, unhook the charger and plug it back in again. If this does not work it may be time to change the battery.
