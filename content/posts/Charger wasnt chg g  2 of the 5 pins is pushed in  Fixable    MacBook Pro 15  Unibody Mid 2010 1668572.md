title: You Won't Believe Why Your Macbook Pro Isn't Charging: 2 of the 5 Pins Pushed In - Can it be Fixed?

Are you having trouble charging your MacBook Pro? You may be surprised to learn that it could be due to something as simple as two of the five pins being pushed in. But can this be fixed? Let's take a closer look.

First, it's important to understand the role of these pins. The pins in question are located in the charging port of your MacBook Pro and are responsible for transferring power and data from the charger to the computer. When two of these pins are pushed in, the charging port may not receive enough power to charge the battery.

So, how did this happen? It's possible that the pins were pushed in by force, such as inserting the charger at the wrong angle or bumping the computer while it was charging. It's also possible that normal wear and tear over time could cause the pins to become misaligned or pushed in.

Fortunately, this issue can be fixed with some simple steps. The first thing to do is to turn off your MacBook Pro and unplug the charger. Then, take a small object such as a toothpick or needle and use it to gently pry the pins back into place. Be very careful not to damage the pins or any other parts of the charging port while doing so.

If this doesn't work, you may need to have the charging port replaced by a professional technician. This is a more complex process and should only be attempted by someone with experience in repairing MacBook Pros.

In conclusion, if you're having trouble charging your MacBook Pro, don't panic. Check the pins in the charging port and see if any are pushed in. If so, try to gently pry them back into place with a small object. If that doesn't work, seek the help of a professional. With a little patience and care, your MacBook Pro should be charging like new in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 #2 gold pin is pushed in. Can it be pulled back out? Mac isn't charging. I'm assuming this is the problem.

 Unplug the Mag-Safe adapter then use a wooden tooth pick to push the pins in and see if you can get it to release.   The # 2 & 4 pins are the pins voltage is carried through.  Heres the pin out:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe

 I'm pretty confident that's why it's not charging too.  It's easier to just replace the DC-IN board on that model.  It's about $15 on eBay for the part and the guide is of course on here.  I have attempted to pull pins out, never had any success personally.
