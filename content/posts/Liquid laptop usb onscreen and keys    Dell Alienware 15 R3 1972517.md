Title: You Won't Believe What Dell's Alienware 15 R3 Can Do – USB Onscreen and Keys Now Liquid and Futuristic!

Introduction:

Dell's Alienware brand is renowned for being one of the top-tier gaming laptop manufacturers in the market. With their latest release, the Alienware 15 R3, gamers are in for a treat as they have introduced some revolutionary features that have never been seen before in the laptop market.

Body:

The Alienware 15 R3 is loaded with some of the best features one could expect from a gaming laptop. However, the two major changes that Dell has made are the USB onscreen and the liquid cooling technology. Let's take a closer look at these groundbreaking new features.

USB Onscreen:

The USB onscreen is a feature that has never been seen before in a laptop. With this feature, the Alienware 15 R3 has three USB ports built right into the screen, making it easier for gamers to plug in their gaming peripherals without having to fiddle around at the back of the laptop.

This feature has an added advantage for gamers who use VR headsets as it eliminates the need for an additional USB hub. This makes the Alienware 15 R3 the ultimate gaming laptop for VR enthusiasts.

Liquid Cooling Technology:

The liquid cooling technology is another breakthrough feature that Dell has introduced with the Alienware 15 R3. The laptop has a unique thermal design that enables it to stay cool even during intense gaming sessions. The use of liquid cooling technology ensures that the laptop does not overheat, thereby extending its lifespan.

The futuristic design of the keyboard, with its liquid and futuristic keys, is another added advantage of the liquid cooling technology. The keys have been redesigned to be more durable and resistant to key fading. The keyboard's liquid nature also ensures that the keys are much quieter, making the laptop the ideal gaming laptop for those who prefer a quieter experience.

Conclusion:

Dell's Alienware 15 R3 is a game-changer in the laptop market, and their USB onscreen and liquid cooling technology features are the icing on the cake. Gamers who are looking for a high-performance laptop with some of the most groundbreaking features in the market will find their ultimate match in the Alienware 15 R3. It's a laptop that offers the best of both worlds – performance and convenience. To sum up, the Alienware 15 R3 is a must-have for any gaming enthusiast who is looking for a cutting-edge gaming laptop.
