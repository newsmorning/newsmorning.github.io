# Unlock the Hidden Power of Your PC: Discover 7 Secret Techniques to Skyrocket Your RAM and Turbocharge Your Windows Performance!

If you are like most computer users, you probably have a computer that is a few years old and may not be running as fast as it used to. But did you know that you can unlock the hidden power of your PC and get it running faster than ever before? With these seven secret techniques to skyrocket your RAM and turbocharge your Windows performance, you too can experience lightning-fast performance that was previously only available to high-end gaming PCs.

## Technique 1: Upgrade Your RAM

The easiest and most effective way to turbocharge your Windows performance is to upgrade your RAM. RAM (Random Access Memory) is the short-term memory of your computer, and the more RAM you have, the more programs you can run at once without slowing down. To find out how much RAM your PC has, right-click on Computer or My Computer and select Properties. If your PC has less than 8GB of RAM, consider upgrading to at least 16GB.

## Technique 2: Install an SSD

An SSD (Solid State Drive) is a type of storage device that uses flash memory to store data. Unlike a traditional hard drive, SSDs have no moving parts, which makes them much faster and more reliable. Installing an SSD in your PC can greatly improve your Windows performance, as it allows your computer to boot up and load programs much faster than a traditional hard drive.

## Technique 3: Disable Startup Programs

Many programs automatically start up when you turn on your PC, which can slow down your computer's boot time and overall performance. To disable these programs, open the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and click on the Startup tab. Here, you can disable any programs that you don't need to start automatically.

## Technique 4: Adjust Visual Effects

Windows comes with a variety of visual effects that can make your desktop look cool, but they can also slow down your computer's performance. To adjust these visual effects, right-click on Computer or My Computer and select Properties. Click on Advanced System Settings and select the Advanced tab. Click on the Settings button under Performance, and you can either select "Adjust for best performance" or choose which visual effects you want to keep.

## Technique 5: Update Drivers

Your PC's drivers are the software that allows your operating system to communicate with your hardware. Outdated or corrupt drivers can cause all sorts of problems, including slow performance. To update your drivers, go to your PC manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers for your computer.

## Technique 6: Run a Disk Cleanup

Over time, your PC can accumulate a lot of unnecessary files that take up space on your hard drive and slow down your computer's performance. To run a disk cleanup, right-click on your hard drive in File Explorer and select Properties. Click on the Disk Cleanup button, and Windows will scan your hard drive and provide a list of files that you can safely delete.

## Technique 7: Use a Registry Cleaner

The Windows Registry is a database that stores important settings and configuration information for your PC. Over time, the Registry can become cluttered with invalid or outdated entries, which can slow down your computer's performance. To clean your Registry, you can use a reputable Registry cleaner program, such as CCleaner.

By using these seven secret techniques to turbocharge your Windows performance, you can unlock the hidden power of your PC and experience lightning-fast speeds that you never thought were possible. So why wait? Start boosting your PC's performance today!

There are few things quite as
annoying as a computer that’s starting to run slow. 
 
As good as the Windows 10 operating
system is, Windows computers still have the problem of running much more slowly
over time.
 
In this article, you’ll learn seven of the most effective ways to clear out old memory and boost available RAM in a Windows machine that’s suffering from performance issues.

## Why Computers Slow Down
 
If you’ve owned your computer for a
while, there are any number of issues that can cause it to slow down. Many of
these are out of your control, but a few aren’t.
 
These issues include:
 
- Memory leaks from software you’ve installedPower surges and normal usage degrading system componentsBad hard drive sectors or bad memory chips due to age and useNot installing enough RAMExcessive software launching at startupMalware and viruses consuming system resources

 
Even though you can’t control the effects of normal aging, there’s a lot you can do to speed up your computer. These include things like defragmenting your hard drive, performing virus scans, and disabling the User Account Control (UAC).
 
However, the most significant
effect you can have on system performance is making sure your memory usage is
fully optimized. 
 
## 1. RAM Hogs: Low Hanging Fruit
 
The fastest and easiest way to clear up memory that’s being
used is to make sure there are no system processes consuming all the system
resources.
 
This is an easy problem to develop over time, especially if
you’re in the habit of installing a lot of software. There’s also a very easy
solution. 
 
Check the system processes listed in the Task Manager and
look for problem applications you don’t recognize that are consuming excessive
RAM.
 
- Right click the Windows task bar and select Task Manager.Click on the Processes tab.Sort the processes by Memory and look for
 - programs at the top of the list that you don’t recognize.

 
If you spot any problem applications, go into the Control Panel, click on Programs and Features, and uninstall
those problem applications.
 
## 2. Clean Up Startup Programs
 
Unfortunately, resolving memory issues and freeing up your
RAM is not usually that easy. Over time, software you’ve installed and
forgotten about can get embedded into your system but may not consume RAM
constantly. 
 
In these cases, these programs won’t show up at the top of
the list in the Task Manager. However, they are part of the list of programs
that launch every time your computer starts and contribute to chewing away at
your available RAM.
 
- Still in the Task Manager, click on the Startup tab.Sort the list by the Startup impact field.Identify applications you don’t recognize or
 - don’t need.Right-click on the application and select Disable.

 
When each of these programs launch, they devour a bit of
memory individually. They all run in the background and consume your RAM.
Disabling them from running at startup prevents this from happening.
 
## 3. Clear Page File at Shutdown
 
Whenever you shut down your computer, the system RAM is
always cleared. However, the page file that’s stored on the hard drive isn’t.
 
The page file is an area of the physical hard drive that the
operating system uses as extra RAM when the physical RAM is full. Ensuring that
the page file is cleared just like RAM is will keep things clean and efficient
the next time you start your computer.
 
You can enable this by setting the ClearPageFileAtShutdown
registry key to 1. Windows 10 has this set to 0 by default. Enabling this is
easy.
 
- Click the start menu and type Regedit. Click on the Regedit run command.This will open the Registry Editor. Navigate to
 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
 - Management.Double-click on the ClearPageFileAtShutdown key on the right.Set the Value
 - data field to 1 and click OK.

 
The next time you restart your computer, the page file will clear. 
 
## 4. Check for Device Driver Issues 
 
Over time, device drivers become updated, and various Windows updates could lead to corrupt driver files or driver conflicts. These issues can sometimes lead to memory leaks and the longer your computer is running, could lead to excessive RAM consumption.
 
It’s important to make sure your system is clear of device
driver issues. You can check this quickly by using the Device Manager.
 
- Open the Control
 - Panel and double click Device
 - Manager.Expand each branch inside the Device Manager and
 - look for a yellow explanation mark icon. This is an alert for a driver issue.If you see an alert, right click on the device
 - and select Update driver.

 
Try to let the system look for latest drivers online if you
can. Otherwise you’ll need to visit the manufacturer website and download the
latest driver. 
 
Keeping any device issues clear and all your drivers updated
will ensure your system is running smoothly and drivers aren’t causing memory
issues.
 
## 5. Reduce Windows Visual Effects
 
Windows 10 comes with a lot of busy visual effects for
windows, menus, tooltips and more. If you have plenty of RAM, these visual
effects aren’t an issue. 
 
But if you’re running with a bare minimum of available RAM,
disabling these effects can significantly increase available memory.
 
To disable Windows visual effects:
 
- Open File Explorer, right-click on This PC, and click on Properties.On the left side of this window, click on Advanced system settings.In the Performance
 - section, click the Settings button.In the Performance Options window, select Adjust for best performance.

 
You’ll notice that all the animated features are disabled
with this setting. If you want, you can instead select Custom, and then enable any of the visual effects that you can’t
live without.
 
## 6. Flush Memory Cache
 
When you open and close applications frequently, sometimes
certain programs don’t properly release system memory when closing. Over time,
these orphan threads consume RAM and lead to slow system performance.
 
There is a very simple shortcut you can create that’ll flush
the memory cache and clean out all those old cobwebs of lost memory. 
 
This shortcut is:
 
%windir%\system32\rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks
 
If you’re not sure how to configure this shortcut, you can read a guide to flushing the memory cache that’ll walk you through all of the steps.
 
## 7. Add More RAM
 
Of course, one of the easiest ways to free up more memory is
to boost the existing amount of RAM you have.
 
If you’re not sure what kind of memory your computer takes,
you can use the Crucial Advisor to run a scan on your PC and find the best
memory to buy.
 
Scans are fast and easy, and the resulting web page will
list all memory cards that are available for your system.
 
## Memory Is Important
 
Of all the things you can do to boost your old computer’s
performance, there is nothing as effective as clearing out or boosting your
available RAM. 
 
The less your computer needs to rely on your hard drive and
the page file because the physical RAM is full, the faster your computer will
behave.
