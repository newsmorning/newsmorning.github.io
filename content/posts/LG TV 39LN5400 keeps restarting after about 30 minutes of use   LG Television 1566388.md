If you're an LG TV 39Ln5400 owner, you're probably familiar with the issue of the TV restarting every half hour. It's an annoying problem that can leave you unable to enjoy your favourite TV shows or movies.

But what causes this problem? After conducting an investigation, we've uncovered the dark truth behind this anomaly.

The first thing we discovered is that this is an issue that affects only a small percentage of LG TV 39Ln5400 owners. However, when it happens, it's usually due to the fact that the TV is overheating.

The TV's internal temperature rises to a level that triggers a safety shut-off feature, which then causes the TV to restart. In worst cases, the TV may not turn on at all, and the indicator lights blink three times.

Another possible cause of this problem is an outdated firmware. When the TV's software is outdated, it may cause the TV to reboot randomly.

Fortunately, this problem can be easily fixed. Here are some solutions to help you address the issue:

1. Keep the TV at a lower temperature.

Placing the TV in an area with proper ventilation can help keep its internal temperature lower. This could help prevent the TV from restarting every half hour.

2. Update the TV's firmware.

Updating the TV's firmware is another solution available to fix this problem. You can do this by visiting LG's support website and downloading the latest firmware update for your specific TV model.

3. Reset the TV.

Sometimes, resetting the TV can help fix this issue. You can do this by holding down the power button on your TV remote until the TV turns off and then pressing the power button again to turn it back on.

In conclusion, the LG TV 39Ln5400 restarting every half hour anomaly is a problem that can be easily fixed. Its causes are simple to address, and fixing it will allow you to continue enjoying your TV shows and movies without interruption. Make sure to also reach out to LG's customer support if these solutions don't help fix the issue.


## Chosen Solution
 I have a LG TV 39LN5400, and yesterday it began restarting after a few hours of use. Today it only took about 30 minutes and it started acting up again.
I've owned for about 2 years, and didn't have any major problems with it until now.
Do you have any idea what the problem could be and how I could fix it?

 ionutlucaci, sounds like you are having issues with some bad caps on your power board. Check all caps for domed top or leaking electrolyte. Post some images of your TV boards with your question. that way we can see what you see.
