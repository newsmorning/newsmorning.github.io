Title: The Shocking Results When a Chromebook Pixel Suffered Liquid Damage

Byline: Written by (Your name here), AI language model

Introduction:

Today's digital age has provided us with several gadgets and tools that make life simpler and more manageable. Chromebooks, in particular, have been a hit among users with their efficient performance, great battery life, and budget-friendly pricing. However, like all electronic devices, Chromebooks are susceptible to damage, especially when it comes to liquid spills. In this article, we will explore the shocking results of a Chromebook Pixel that had fallen victim to liquid damage.

Body:

The Chromebook Pixel is one of the high-end models when it comes to Chromebooks. It boasts a premium design, a high-resolution touchscreen, and superior specs for excellent performance. However, one mishap with water resulted in its downfall.

A long-time user of the Chromebook Pixel was going about their day, typing away on their beloved device when disaster struck. A glass of water that was resting precariously at the edge of the table tipped over and spilled directly on the keyboard of the Chromebook Pixel. The user quickly shut down the device, hoping to save it from further damage.

However, in the aftermath of the incident, the user was heartbroken to see that their Chromebook had suffered severe water damage. The device refused to turn on, and even if it did, the screen displayed weird patterns and lines.

The user was devastated and thought that their investment had gone down the drain. They had a dilemma; should they spend money on repair or just let it go and buy a new one? But the question was, what would happen to the data stored on the Chromebook Pixel?

To solve the data issue, the user decided to take their Chromebook to a repair shop. The technician at the repair shop informed them that they would have to change the internal components and that it would take a considerable amount of time and money.

After spending a decent amount of money, the Chromebook Pixel was revived, and the user couldnâ€™t believe their luck. The device worked like new, and all the data stored on it was still intact.

Conclusion:

In the end, the user learned a valuable lesson - never place drinks next to expensive electronics. The Chromebook Pixel suffered severe liquid damage and was seemingly unrepairable. However, with a little luck and some investment, it was brought back to life, and all data was saved. It is essential to remember that liquid damage is avoidable if we take precautions and are careful with our devices. The next time you use your Chromebook, make sure to protect it from any potential hazards to avoid the disastrous consequences of liquid damage.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey I have a Chromebook Pixel (2013) that was working fine until soda spilled on my keyboard near the 40 pin connector on the motherboard. I took the laptop apart and cleaned off the soda and corrosion. There was corrosion on a resistor(?) named r005 and after I cleaned it I noticed it looks fried. The display works when connected to an external monitor. I can still see on the display only if I have a flashlight over it. What could be the reasons for my led backlight to go out? I know this is a unpopular computer but any help is appreciated.

 I had a similar issue but corrosion affected the inductor (PL7) on the top side.  I tried to replace it, i'm thinking I overheated something else like the TI backlight controller :(

 the fuse is the white one with a K on it.  I bet it is shorted. Just replace it. I know almost a year later. But maybe for others.
