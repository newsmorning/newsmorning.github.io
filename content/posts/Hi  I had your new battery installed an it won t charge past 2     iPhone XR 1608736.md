If you're an iPhone user, you know how important it is to have a reliable battery that lasts all day long. So, it's not surprising for many users to seek repair or replacement services when their battery starts to fail. However, not all battery replacement services are created equal.

Recently, a shocking incident involving the iPhone XR battery replacement service has surfaced online. According to the reports, a user's iPhone XR battery got busted right after a new battery installation by an unauthorized third-party repair shop.

So, what went wrong? Let's dig deeper into the issue.

### The Cause of the Problem

Upon investigation, it was found that the third-party repair shop had not used an authentic Apple battery for replacement. Instead, they had used a cheap, counterfeit battery that lacked the proper safety standards. This caused the battery to malfunction and ultimately explode, damaging the iPhone XR.

It's important to note that Apple uses advanced safety measures to prevent such incidents from happening. Apple's batteries are made with high-quality components and are thoroughly tested before being released for use. In contrast, third-party batteries are often made by untested manufacturers who use low-quality components to make a cheaper product.

### The Risks of Using Third-Party Repair Services

This shocking incident highlights the risks associated with using unauthorized third-party repair services. These services may seem cheaper, but they may use counterfeit parts or perform poorly executed repairs, risking the safety and performance of your device.

In addition, Apple offers a limited warranty on batteries and repairs conducted by authorized service providers. This warranty ensures that your device is repaired to Apple's standards, using genuine parts that meet their safety and quality standards. By using an unauthorized third-party repair service, you risk losing this warranty and any future support from Apple.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the iPhone XR battery replacement incident serves as a cautionary tale for all iPhone users. Trusting unauthorized repair services, especially for batteries, may lead to more significant issues and risks in the long run.

The best course of action is to go directly through Apple or an authorized service provider for any repairs or replacements. These services guarantee the use of genuine Apple parts and come with warranties for added security and protection.

If you're looking for a reliable battery replacement service for your iPhone, look no further than Apple or an authorized service provider. It may cost more, but it's a small price to pay for safety, quality, and peace of mind.

## Chosen Solution
 I had your new battery installed, won't charge past 2% tried different cables n plugs I checked the port for dust/debris. Still won't charge. I tried leaving it charge over night an same. Any info. Thanks

 If they’re anything like the 8 series, I don’t necessarily thing it’s an issue with the battery. A lot of people, mostly DIY-ers and beginners, will knock off a component near the battery connector that is part of the battery gas gauge circuit, which is pretty self explanatory.
I would at least try to confirm whether or not I’m right on this by using the old battery, if it’s not severely bent or damaged. If it charges normally, then it’s most likely the replacement battery or the connector wasn’t seated. If the issue still persists with the old battery, you might have knocked off battery gas gauge or something related. If that is the case, you can get it repaired by someone who is skilled in micro soldering. This is not a repair you should DIY as you can mess up your phone beyond repair real fast. I recommend iPad Rehab, STS Telecom, or Rossman Repair. All of them have youtube channels you can check out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3gD-JqD...
