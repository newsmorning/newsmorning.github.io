# Unlock the Secrets to Dominate Alberhastic Guardian Raids in Lost Ark - Your Ultimate Mechanics Guide!

Lost Ark has quickly become a popular MMORPG game since its release. And just like any game, progressing through its levels become much harder as you make your way through. One of these challenges you will encounter is the Alberhastic Guardian Raid, which poses as one of the hardest and most tactically-demanding raids in the game. In this article, we will be discussing the mechanics you need to know to dominate the Alberhastic Guardian Raid.

## Understanding the Alberhastic Guardian Raid

The Alberhastic Guardian Raid is a six-player raid, which can be accessed once you reach level 50 in Lost Ark. It has many mechanics that require proper understanding and execution to be able to defeat the raid boss, Alberhastic. Understanding the fight mechanics is essential to the raid’s success, as it will give you the best possible chance of beating the encounter.

## The Mechanics

The Alberhastic Guardian Raid is divided into two phases. The first phase involves facing two large golems and clearing them from the map. Meanwhile, the second phase fight is all about the raid boss, which has both a physical and a magical form.

### Phase One

The first phase of the Alberhastic Guardian Raid involves facing two large golems, and you will need to take them down, one at a time, to move onto the second phase. The frontline tanks will need to hold their attention while the DPS team focus their attacks.

One of the things you need to keep in mind during this phase is managing the golems’ ‘medusa’ skill. This ability will randomly select players from the team and apply a debuff, putting them to sleep for a short time. To prevent this from happening, the players affected by the debuff should run away from the team and make sure they are isolated from other players.

### Phase Two

After clearing the golems, you will then move onto the second phase of the Alberhastic Guardian Raid. This phase is a bit more complicated. In this phase, the raid boss, Alberhastic, will spawn in two different forms, physical and magical. The raid team must switch back and forth between these forms to take them down.

### Physical Form

When the boss is in its physical form, its blue HP bar will be visible. And in this form, you will need to watch out for the boss’ attacks, which can deal a significant amount of damage to your team. The tank players in your team should keep the boss focused on them to prevent other players from being hit by heavy attacks. The DPS players should focus their attacks on the boss’ back, which is its weak spot, to deal significant damage.

### Magical Form

When Alberhastic switches to its magical form, the blue HP bar of the boss will disappear, and a red MP bar will appear instead. To deal damage to this form, your team will need to focus on the boss’ orange-colored weakness priority mark. Taking down the magical form will drop the boss' HP by 10%, making it easier to defeat.

## Conclusion

The Alberhastic Guardian Raid poses a significant challenge that will require a lot of coordination, timing, and strategy. Understanding the mechanics of the raid and having the right people in your team will give you a better chance of success. Remember to communicate with your team during the fight and have your designated players execute their roles for the best possible outcome. Best of luck and happy raiding!

When playing Lost Ark, the Alberhastic is one of several Guardians you will come across in Raids, which are like boss fights. These Guardians possess mechanics that help them battle their enemies (you). In order to defeat these bosses and move on to the next tiers and levels of Lost Ark, it is important to know what these mechanics are and how they work. In this guide, we will show you exactly just that. Here, we will show you all of Alberhastic’s mechanics and how to defeat them.
 
## Lost Ark Alberhastic Guardian Raids Mechanics Guide
 

 
For the Alberhastic’s first mechanic in the Guardian Raid in Lost Ark, it will create a white aura. Once it does so, you will need to rush in and pick up the yellow orb in the vicinity. While the orb is a debuff, it will help protect you from the attacks that will follow.
 
Likewise, if the Alberhastic Guardian boss creates a yellow aura, you will need to pick up a white orb. When doing so, it is imperative to not pick any other colored orb. After picking up this orb, you need to wait for a while for the boss to perform its mechanic. Ensuring that you pick up the right orbs will help in allowing you to survive.
 
Moving on to the second main mechanic for this boss in Lost Ark, here, the boss will spawn 4 blue tornadoes. You need to head inside these tornadoes. However, you need to do so at the right time. You need to enter the tornado when Alberhastic is in the winged form i.e when he is in the sky. Doing so will protect you from any fatal air attacks from the Guardian.
 
Getting to the third Alberhastic Guardian Raid Mechanic in Lost Ark, you need to stay underneath the boss when he is in the air. Before Alberhastic makes his way to the ground, you need to press the spacebar and immediately move. You can move in any direction, as long as you do not get crushed by the boss.
 
So there you have it. These were all of the Alberhastic Guardian Raids mechanics in Lost Ark. As you can see, there are several ways to battle this boss and come out victorious. Now that you know all about the Alberhastic, take a look at our Lost Ark Helgaia Mechanics Guide.
