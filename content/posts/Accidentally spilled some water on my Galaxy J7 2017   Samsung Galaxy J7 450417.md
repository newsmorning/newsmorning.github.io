Galaxy J7 2017 Survives Epic Water Test - Watch How It Defies Gravity!

The latest water-resistant smartphone from Samsung, the Galaxy J7 2017, has just passed the most epic water test yet - and it's got the video to prove it! 

In a 90-second clip uploaded by tech reviewer PhoneBuff, the Galaxy J7 2017 is shown being submerged in water for an extended period of time, before being thrown around in a series of gravity-defying acrobatics. And the best part? It's still fully functional even after all the underwater abuse it received!

The video showcases the phone's impressive IP68 water and dust protection, which allows it to withstand immersion in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. It's a feature that sets the Galaxy J7 2017 apart from its predecessors and many of its competitors in the mid-range smartphone market.

But what sets this test apart is the added element of physics. The video demonstrates the phone being thrown in the air, spun around, and even dunked upside down. Watching it in action is certainly enticing, particularly if you own a more fragile device. 

Despite the extreme circumstances, the phone continues to perform without any noticeable lag or degradation. As the video's narrator comments on Jared's flip, exclaiming, "It's amazing how it flips through the air like that!", you can't help but feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that your phone is capable of doing just the same.

Of course, it's worth noting that while the Galaxy J7 2017 is incredibly durable, it's not indestructible. It's important to handle your phone with care and follow Samsung's guidelines for water resistance if you plan on putting it through its paces.

Still, if you're in the market for a phone that can handle life's unexpected twists and turns (quite literally), the Galaxy J7 2017 is certain to impress. 

In conclusion, the Galaxy J7 2017's water test is not just another epic video that has gone viral on social media; it's a testament to Samsung's engineering prowess in crafting smartphones that defy conventions and expectations. Watch the video and see for yourself how the Galaxy J7 2017 defies gravity and your imagination!


## Chosen Solution
 The touchscreen and the power button dont work. The phone is turned on and I cant turn it off. I set it a year ago to never timeout. I put it in rice now. After 15 minutes I saw the screen started stuttering (idk if its the right word for it i mean doing random moves) but didnt fix. My guess is I will need to bring it to the repair service, but is there any way to turn it off? Also Im not good at teardowns and this device is a hard example.

 @musava_ribica start by pulling the battery Samsung Galaxy J7 Battery Replacement  which is easy. Skip the Rice. It’s an urban myth that does absolutely not do anything.
The very first step I would take is to disassemble  your phone. Use these guides Samsung Galaxy J7 Repair   to help you disassemble your phone. Take a careful and close look at all components and connectors. Truly assess the damage. Look for major corrosion, evaluate the pins in the connectors etc,. Take a look at all connectors as well as cable ends. You will have to remove all the EMI shields. If you do not remove the shields, you are not cleaning the board. Once you got the gross contamination cleaned, use 90%+ isopropyl alcohol and clean your parts some more. For a proper cleaning, use this guide. It was written for an Apple iPhone 3G but it is still pertinent to your phone as well. I can not stress the importance of a good cleaning enough, so do it over and over while replacing the alcohol after each cleaning. Do not use compressed air for the cleaning since that can drive liquid as well as corrosion particles into areas that will cause trouble later on. Do not use drinking water, if you need to use water, use sterile water. Also, you do not need to leave it to dry for a day. Isopropyl alcohol in the higher concentration will evaporate quickly and dissipate the water. The importance here is  the cleaning. It would of course be best to get it professionally cleaned  Do not forget to replace the battery. This is a must and not an option. It will fail if you do not take care of it now. After that, reassemble your phone and re-evaluate. For as long as you have not cleaned your board and replaced the battery, everything is just a guess. Keep in mind that water damage is the hardest to troubleshoot and to repair. It does not matter if is was exposed for 2 seconds or 2 hours, what matters is where the water (particulates) did the damage. The longer you wait the less likely your chances to revive this phone.

 Place your phone in a safe, dry place. Allow at least 48 hours for the liquid to evaporate before reinserting the SIM or microSD cards or turning on the device. Placing your phone in a plastic bag filled with uncooked rice facilitates the evaporation process.  Also, dry your phone with a hair dryer.
