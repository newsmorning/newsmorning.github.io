## Chosen Solution
 Need to activate tablet

 Hi, I'm having the same issue. But I presee the power and the volume up bottom at the same time until the reset screen appeared, the I clicked the second choice which is "reboot to bootloader" my phone stayed on the " nextbook powered by android" screen for about 10 minutes. I turned it off because I thought it froze. Well when I turned it on it actually came up to raindrops on the screen like it was unlocked for about .3 seconds, so I'm thinking if I let it go until it is done doing what ever it I'd it's doing I may have unlocked it.
