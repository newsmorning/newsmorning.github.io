For many individuals, their Macbook is their most prized possession. As it sits there on the desk or in their lap, it provides them with endless hours of entertainment, work, and connection. Unfortunately, as with any piece of technology, issues can arise. For one Macbook user, the issue began with a white screen, leading them to purchase a new LCD cable in hopes of a quick fix.

However, this Macbook user was in for a shock when the replacement cable did not solve the problem. The white screen persisted, leaving the user with an unusable device and a feeling of frustration. This experience begs the question - could your Retina 2016 Macbook be next?

It is not uncommon for LCD cables to fail, and in many cases, a replacement cable is all that is needed to fix the issue. However, in some cases, the issue may be more complex, requiring professional diagnosis and repair. It is important to understand the potential causes of LCD cable failure and how to avoid them.

One common cause of LCD cable failure is wear and tear. Over time, the constant opening and closing of the Macbook can cause damage to the cable. Additionally, the cable's flexibility can wear down over time, leading to breaks or tears. To avoid this issue, try to be gentle when opening and closing your Macbook and avoid excessive flexing of the cable.

Another potential cause of LCD cable failure is damage caused by water or other liquid spills. Liquid can seep into the Macbook and damage various components, including the LCD cable. To avoid this issue, be cautious when consuming liquids near your Macbook and consider using a protective cover.

In some cases, LCD cable failure may be due to physical damage caused by dropping the Macbook or other accidents. The best way to avoid this issue is to handle your Macbook with care and consider using a protective case.

While LCD cable failure is a frustrating and disruptive issue, there are steps you can take to avoid it. By being mindful of the potential causes and taking proper precautions, you can help to ensure that your Macbook continues to function as intended.

In the event that LCD cable failure does occur, it is important to seek professional diagnosis and repair. Attempting to fix the issue yourself can lead to further damage and may void your warranty. With the proper care and attention, your Macbook can continue to provide you with years of reliable use.

## Chosen Solution
 I had a white screen issue with my MacBook replaced the LCD cable. I still got white screen problem after replacing the LCD cable - MacBook do work on a external monitor. Anyone have idea what to do about it?  Should I do something actively to activate the new cable for some reason it don’t work?

 Given the fact the external display is working, and replacing the cable didn’t alter anything tells us the internal display logic its self is bad. Just like the MacBook Pro Apple moved the T-CON logic to sit within the main case vs the display lid. This puts it at risk either overheating or the massive number of cables now required
