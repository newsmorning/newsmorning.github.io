Dry cleaning is a trusted method of cleaning clothes without the risk of shrinking, fading, or dye bleeding. But what happens when dry-cleaning goes wrong? Recently, a dry-cleaning service ruined a white jacket, turning it beige, leaving the owner wondering what went wrong. Dry-cleaning is supposed to renew and refresh clothes, but unfortunately, it can end up doing more harm than good.

The owner of the jacket in question shared her experience on social media, expressing her shock and frustration. She bought the jacket a few months ago and wore it only once. After careful inspection, she noticed that the jacket had yellow stains on the cuffs and collar. She took the jacket to a reputable dry-cleaning service that came highly recommended. She thought it was the best solution since she didn't want to risk damaging the jacket by washing it at home.

The dry-cleaning service inspected the jacket and recommended dry cleaning since the material was 100% cotton, which can shrink if washed with water. The owner left the jacket for dry cleaning with high hopes that the jacket would come back looking brand new. However, she was in for a shock when she saw the jacket. Instead of being white, it was now beige!

But what could have gone wrong during the dry-cleaning procedure? There are several reasons why dry-cleaning could go wrong.

First, the dry-cleaning service could have used the wrong solvent or chemical composition. Dry-cleaning machines use a chemical solvent called perchloroethylene (perc) to clean the clothes. Using the wrong solvent, or an incorrect chemical combination, could have resulted in the colour change of the jacket.

Second, improper handling of the jacket could have caused the discolouration. The dry-cleaning service should have used caution while handling the jacket, ensuring that they stored it in a way that didn't expose it to direct sunlight or other environmental conditions.

Third, faulty equipment could have led to the discolouration. Machines used for dry cleaning are inspected, and faults are attended to regularly. A machine malfunction or breakdown could have contributed to the jacket's discolouration.

In conclusion, dry-cleaning is a trusted method of cleaning clothes if done correctly. As a result, it would be best to take your clothes to a reputable dry cleaning service with a proven track record. Before choosing a dry-cleaning service, read reviews to gauge previous customers' experiences. When you pick up your clothes after dry cleaning, inspect them thoroughly before leaving the dry-cleaning establishment. If you're not happy with the results, ask the dry cleaner to redo the job. If you notice any visible signs of damage on your clothes, speak to the dry-cleaning service owner immediately.

In the case of the white jacket that turned beige, the owner spoke to the dry-cleaning service owner, who admitted to messing up and refunded the full cost of the cleaning service. Not all bad experiences have a happy ending, so it's best to prevent such experiences in the first place. Choose your dry-cleaning service wisely and be vigilant after each dry-cleaning service.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I have a Mango white jacket I just love. I have used a few times so I wanted to clean it. I took it to a professional to perform a dry cleaning on the jacket. I went to get my jacket today and it  is now beige when before was white (the diference is massive). Looks like it was used for ten years! In the dry cleaning store I was told that this sometimes happens with white jackets, because the fabric reacts to the products they use to clean it. My question is: should I believe the man or did he just ruin my jacket and is trying to mislead me? I feel that he doesn't want to take responsability for what he did.
What should I do to get my jacket white again?
Thank you!!

Why does dry cleaning turn clothes dingy gray?
If you are a frequent dry cleaning customer, you may have noticed that sometimes your lighter colored garments come back dingy or grayish in color after dry cleaning. This problem is most often caused by a process called “redeposition”.
The cause of redeposition is very similar to what happens to bath water when you take a bath, you become cleaner and the water becomes dirtier. When clothes are dry cleaned, the dirt, oil, and grime on the dirty clothes is removed and then becomes suspended in the dry cleaning solvent. Redeposition occurs when the  suspended soil is “re-deposited” onto garments in subsequent loads.  There is often a faint but very unpleasant odor associated with redeposition. It smells like a cross between body odor, stinky feet, and rotting fish.
Dry cleaning solvent is very expensive, so its typically filtered, distilled, recycled, and reused many times. Many higher quality dry cleaners avoid redeposition by continually distilling or “cooking” their solvent, so each load of clothes is cleaned with fresh solvent. However, continually distilling solvent is expensive. So, some cleaners (especially the one price, deep discount, economy cleaners) save money by waiting as long as possible before they distill their solvent. Fresh solvent should be clear, but I’ve seen some cleaners using solvent as dark as black coffee. It’s really gross!
There is some good news. The dingy gray color and foul odor caused by redeposition can often be removed by dry cleaning the garment in fresh solvent. When shopping for a new cleaner, ask them how often they distill their solvent. “Continually” is the best answer.

 I say that either way it is his fault. If he has a business that specializes in this then he should know what to do. I say that you go back and demand either a refund or for them to fix or repay you for the jacket.  I believe that in these conditions you are the victim.
