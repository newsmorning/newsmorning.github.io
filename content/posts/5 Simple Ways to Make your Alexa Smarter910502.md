# Revolutionize Your Home with These 5 Tricks to Boost Your Alexa's IQ!

Alexa, the digital assistant developed by Amazon, has been revolutionizing the way we interact with our homes. From playing music to controlling our lights and thermostats, Alexa has become an integral part of many households. However, did you know that you can increase Alexa's intelligence and capabilities? In this article, we will discuss five tricks to boost Alexa's IQ and revolutionize your home.

## Trick 1: Enable Skills

Skills are like apps that you can add to your Alexa, which allows it to perform additional tasks. To enable a skill, type in the search box and browse the options. For example, you can enable the “7-Minute Workout” skill by voice command or via the Alexa app, and you can then ask Alexa to start the workout program. Hundreds of other skills are available, including games, trivia, and recipe apps. Enabling these skills will allow Alexa to learn and execute new tasks quickly.

## Trick 2: Routine

Routines are a sequence of tasks that Alexa can carry out in response to a single command. For example, you can create a routine named “Good Morning” that opens your bedroom shades, turns on the lights, and plays your favorite music when you say, “Alexa, Good Morning.” You can also set up a “Goodnight” routine that closes the shades, turns off the lights, and sets the thermostat to your preferred temperature. With routines, you can automate your daily tasks and streamline your life.

## Trick 3: Voice Profiles

Alexa is capable of understanding different voices, and it can create voice profiles for each member of your household. When you use your unique voice profile to activate Alexa, it can personalize your experience based on your preferences. For example, Alexa can play your favorite music playlist when you ask, “Alexa, play my music.” To set up a voice profile, go to Settings > Account Settings > Recognized Voices.

## Trick 4: Customized Responses

Did you know that you can customize Alexa’s responses to specific commands? This feature allows you to personalize the language that Alexa uses when interacting with family members or friends. For example, you can change the response to “good night” to a particular message, such as “sweet dreams” or “have a great night.” To customize responses, go to Settings > Account Settings > Alexa Voice Responses.

## Trick 5: Multi-Room Audio

Alexa can connect to multiple speakers in different rooms, allowing you to play the same music throughout your home. With multi-room audio, you can enjoy music in your living room, kitchen, and bedroom simultaneously. To set up multi-room audio, go to Settings > Audio Groups, and select the rooms you want to include in the group.

In conclusion, by using these five tricks, you can boost Alexa’s IQ and revolutionize the way you interact with your home. Enabling skills, creating routines, using voice profiles, customizing responses, and setting up multi-room audio will allow you to enjoy a fully personalized and convenient home experience. Try these tricks today, and see how Alexa can transform your home!

Just a decade ago no one could imagine we could buy or play our favorite songs by just using voice commands? Over the years, technology has offered some beautifully innovative surprises that neither you or us could ever think of.
 
Well if you didn’t, then let’s get started!
 
- Setting up Voice Profiles

 

 
Alexa is all about listening to your voice commands but what if it doesn’t understand a word you say? So, the first key step is to make Alexa understand your voice. This can be done by setting up a voice profile so Alexa gets to know who is asking the questions or giving voice commands. For setting up a voice profile launch Alexa app and go to settings. In the menu, you will see an option  “Your Voice”. Now follow the on-screen instructions and tap on “Complete” once you’re done.
 
- Set Device Location

 
To maintain complete transparency with Alexa it is important to let Alexa know you current accurate location. This proves really helpful while you request for weather updates, traffic information etc. To set your location for each speaker, open the Alexa app and go to Settings. Select one of the speakers under Devices and enter your address beside Device location.
 
- Turn ON Shipping Notifications

 
Not many of us are aware, but Alexa speakers can play notification sound in various colors. Shipping notifications on Alexa lets you know when your parcel has been shipped or delivered at your doorstep. To enable shipping notifications on Alexa, go to alexa.amazon.com and head on to Settings. Now navigate to Notifications>Shipping notifications and toggle “Delivery Notifications” option.
 
- Set a Default Music Service

 
- Set up a To-Do Account

 
Alexa is compatible with a lot of to-do task manager services.  To make it smarter you can link any of your to-do account to access the list of tasks easily. To do this, head on to Settings> lists. Select “Get Skills” option of the account which you want to link with it. Tap on Enable, login to your respective account, fill up the credentials, authorize your identity and you’re good to go.
