# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Replace Your 2014 Hyundai Veloster's Headlights with This Repair Guide!

Owning a car comes with its own set of responsibilities. One such responsibility is the maintenance and repair of the vehicle. One of the most critical parts of your vehicle is your headlights. They are an essential tool to ensuring your vision on the road is not obstructed, thus giving you a better chance of getting to your destination safely.

If you own a 2014 Hyundai Veloster and you are experiencing some issues with your headlights, you do not need to worry. Replacing the headlights in your car is easier and more straightforward than you might think. This guide will provide you with a step-by-step process that will help you replace your headlights with ease.

## Tools Needed

Before you begin the process of replacing your headlights, you will need the following tools:

- A pair of gloves
- A flathead screwdriver
- A 10mm socket
- A new headlight bulb

## Step 1: Open the Hood

To replace your 2014 Hyundai Veloster's headlights, you will first need to open the hood. The hood release can be found on the driver's side of the vehicle, just below the steering wheel. Once you have located the hood release, pull it towards you to open the hood.

## Step 2: Remove the Headlight Cover

The headlight cover is located at the back of the headlight assembly. Using a flathead screwdriver, gently pry the cover off to expose the headlight.

## Step 3: Remove the Wiring Harness

Behind the headlight, you will find a wiring harness. Depress the clip on the harness and remove it from the headlight. When you remove the wiring harness, be sure to handle it gently as you do not want to break it.

## Step 4: Remove the Headlight Assembly

The headlight assembly is held in place by three bolts. Using a 10mm socket, remove the bolts and then carefully remove the headlight assembly from the vehicle.

## Step 5: Replace the Headlight Bulb

With the headlight assembly removed, you will now be able to access the headlight bulb. Gently twist the headlight bulb to remove it from the assembly. Replace it with a new headlight bulb, being careful not to touch the bulb's glass.

## Final Step: Reinstall the Headlight Assembly

Once you have replaced the headlight bulb, it is time to reinstall the headlight assembly. Carefully line up the assembly with the three bolt holes and secure it back into place. Then, reconnect the wiring harness to the back of the headlight assembly.

## Conclusion

Replacing the headlights in your 2014 Hyundai Veloster is a straightforward process that does not require much time or effort. With the right tools and this guide, you can quickly and easily replace your headlights. By doing this, you will improve your visibility on the road while also keeping yourself and others safe.
