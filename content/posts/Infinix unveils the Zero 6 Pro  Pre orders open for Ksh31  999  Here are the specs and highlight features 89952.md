After days, maybe even weeks of teasing, Infinix has today officially taken the wraps off of their flagship, the Infinix Zero 6. Infinix didn’t release a device from their flagship line in 2018, which could be part of the reason we are seeing the launch this early in the year.
 

 
## Design
 
By far, one of the most uninspiring aspects of this device has gotta be the design. It is getting stale at this point. It is the same design and layout we saw on the Huawei Y9 2019, the Tecno Camon 11, and countless other device. All these seemingly inspired by the iPhone X from 2017. 
 
The iPhone X-style notch and camera set up on the back, a glass back, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, it is all too familiar at this point. The Zero 6 comes in three color accents of Pink, Black, and Blue. 
 
## Camera
 
The camera has got to be one of the most hyped aspect of this device. It spots an intelligent scene recognition feature, similar to the AI features found in Huawei devices and Samsung’s scene optimization feature. 
 
This feature helps the device recognize what the camera is looking at, and then applies some intelligent presets to improve the general outcome of the camera shots. For instance, when taking a photo of flowers, the camera will boost the vibrancy of the petals for a much more appealing shot.
