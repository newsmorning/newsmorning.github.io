Revamp Your Vauxhall Combo's Electrical System with This Easy Indicator Relay Change!

Are you experiencing difficulty when using your Vauxhall Combo's indicators? Is your vehicle's electrical system failing you? Don't worry, because upgrading your Vauxhall Combo's electrical system can be an easy and affordable fix. By replacing the old indicator relay with a new, updated one, you can improve the performance of your vehicle's electrical system without having to break the bank.

Why Should You Upgrade Your Vauxhall Combo's Electrical System?

The electrical system plays a crucial role in the functionality of most vehicles, and the Vauxhall Combo is no exception. It is responsible for powering various electrical components such as the lights, radio, air conditioner and more. A faulty electrical system can affect the functionality of your vehicle and can even be dangerous, especially if it causes your indicators to malfunction. A malfunctioning indicator system is a safety issue, as it can lead to accidents and legal issues.

Upgrading your Vauxhall Combo's electrical system with a new indicator relay can resolve these issues.

How Does an Indicator Relay Work?

The indicator relay is a key component of your Vauxhall Combo's electrical system. It is responsible for controlling the speed and rhythm of the indicator lights. The indicator relay also ensures that the indicator lights function correctly, indicating the driver's intended direction.

When the indicator switch is activated, it sends a signal to the indicator relay. The relay interprets this signal and sends power to the respective indicator lights, causing them to flash in the chosen direction. Once this process is complete, the relay switches off the power to the indicator lights, and the cycle repeats.

Upgrading Your Vauxhall Combo's Indicator Relay

Replacing your Vauxhall Combo's indicator relay is an affordable and easy fix. You do not necessarily have to be a car technician to do this. Here are the steps to follow to replace your Vauxhall Combo's indicator relay.

Step 1: Access the Indicator Relay

To access the indicator relay in your Vauxhall Combo, you will need to remove the fuse box cover. The fuse box is usually located under the dashboard, and the cover can be removed by pulling on it. Once you remove the cover, you will be able to access the indicator relay.

Step 2: Remove the Old Relay

The old relay is usually held in place by a clip or two retaining screws. Using a flathead screwdriver, gently pry the relay loose from its clip. Once loose, it should come out easily. Disconnect the wiring from the old relay and remove it completely.

Step 3: Install the New Relay

Take the new relay and connect the wiring to it, the same way it was connected to the old relay. Once the wiring is connected, push the new relay into the clip until it clicks into place. Make sure that the relay is secure and that the retaining clip is in place.

Step 4: Test Your Indicators

Now, reassemble the fuse box cover, and turn on your Vauxhall Combo's indicator to see if the new indicator relay is working correctly. If the indicator lights flash in their respective directions, the upgrade is successful.

Conclusion

Upgrading your Vauxhall Combo's electrical system with a new indicator relay is an easy and affordable fix. Failure to attend to a malfunctioning electrical system can have serious consequences. By replacing the old indicator relay with a new one, you can improve the functionality of your Vauxhall Combo's electrical system and prevent legal and safety issues. 

In conclusion, take the time to upgrade your Vauxhall Combo's electrical system with a new indicator relay, and enjoy safer and more efficient driving.

## Chosen Solution
 My right hand indicators don't work properly and I have been told that it is probably the relay. And wouldn't you know it, apparently it's a real pain to replace? Because of its location. Apparently it is behind the battery and something else. Any help please.

 Geoff Heyes, the relay is located under the hood, adjacent to the battery. You should see a black weather sealed box. You will need a long extension and a Torx ( I read a T20) socket to remove the cover. The indicator relay is the large yellow one.
