The video, shot and uploaded by a user named @BikerBoyBen, shows him struggling to open the charging compartment door on his Hero5 Black.

## Chosen Solution
 The door to the. Charging compartment
was pulled  off the camera while removing the  charging wire. No damage  to door or camera.   How can door be reattached to camera?

 William Waddell, I do not own this camera but my guess is, you may have to disassemble the camera enough so you can insert the charge port cover back into position(into the retainer). See link below on how to disassemble to access inside camera to enable port cover back in place.  Good luck. I hope this helped you out, if so let me know by pressing the helpful button.
