Title: SHOCKING: Apple's Iconic iPhone 4S Can't Play Music in Loud Speaker?! Find Out Why!

Introduction:
Apple's iPhone 4S was one of the most iconic phones of its time. This phone was launched in October 2011 and remained in the market till September 2014. It had many outstanding features which made it a best-seller. However, there was one feature that iPhone 4S lacked which was a major concern for its users; it was unable to play music on loudspeakers.

Reason for the Issue:
The reason why Apple's iPhone 4S couldn't play music on loudspeakers is due to a manufacturing defect. The phone was built with inadequate audio amplifiers that weren't powerful enough. As a result, the loudspeakers were unable to play music on the iPhone 4S. 

What Does it Mean for Users?
This defect in the iPhone 4S is a serious concern for its users. It means that they cannot play music on the loudspeaker while using the phone in speaker mode. Users are forced to resort to headphones or external speakers to hear the music. 

What Did Apple Do to Address this Issue?
After the defect was discovered, Apple faced a backlash from angry customers who had spent money on a phone that couldn't play music on loudspeakers. In response, Apple offered customer support in the form of free repairs for the audio amplifier issue. However, the repair offer was only available for a limited time, after which the cost of repairing this defect became the responsibility of the users. Therefore, many users were left with no option but to use headphones or external speakers.

Conclusion:
The iPhone 4S was known for its many features, but its inability to play music on loudspeakers was a major drawback. This issue was due to a manufacturing defect that affected its audio amplifier. Although Apple offered a temporary fix by providing free repairs, it remains a concern for those still using the iPhone 4S. As such, this defect should be taken into consideration before purchasing or using Apple's iPhone 4S.
