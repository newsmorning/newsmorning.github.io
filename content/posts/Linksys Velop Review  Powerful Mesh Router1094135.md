# Say Goodbye to Spotty WiFi with the Linksys Velop: The Ultimate Mesh Router Review!

If you are like most people, a reliable WiFi connection is a must-have when it comes to internet connectivity. But what happens when your WiFi starts to get spotty, and you experience connectivity issues? If you have been facing such issues, it's time to consider upgrading to a mesh router like the Linksys Velop.

What is a mesh router, you may ask? A mesh router is a new type of router that uses several nodes distributed throughout your home to provide a more robust and reliable wireless network. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the Linksys Velop and the amazing features that make it the ultimate mesh router.

## Setup process

One of the critical features that we consider when reviewing routers is the ease of setup. With the Linksys Velop, the setup process is quite straightforward. All you need to do is plug in the router and follow the simple on-screen instructions. The setup process can take as little as ten minutes, depending on the number of nodes you have. If you need any help during the installation process, you can always contact the Linksys customer support team.

## Coverage area

One of the most significant issues with traditional routers is their limited coverage area. With the Linksys Velop, the coverage area is extensive, making it an ideal solution for large homes. The router uses several nodes distributed throughout your home, ensuring maximum coverage. Depending on your home layout, you can add more nodes to the system to ensure that you have wireless connectivity everywhere.

## Speed and performance

Speed and performance are crucial when it comes to internet connectivity. The Linksys Velop is incredibly fast, thanks to its tri-band technology. The router's nodes work together to provide a seamless connection, eliminating lag, buffering, and dropped connections. The Linksys Velop is also compatible with all your devices, including smart home devices.

## Parental control

If you're a parent, you know how important it is to monitor your child's internet activities. With the Linksys Velop, you can easily manage your child's internet usage. The router comes equipped with parental controls, allowing you to block websites and set time limits for specific devices.

## Security

The Linksys Velop takes security seriously. The router comes with WPA2 encryption, ensuring that your internet connection stays secure. The router's app also allows you to monitor your network's security and block any unfamiliar devices.

## Conclusion

If you're looking for a reliable, fast, and secure wireless network, the Linksys Velop is the ultimate mesh router for you. With its easy setup process, extensive coverage area, and advanced features, you can say goodbye to spotty WiFi forever. Get yourself a Linksys Velop today, and enjoy a seamless internet connection in your home.

The Linksys Velop is a mesh router designed to blanket even the largest house in a seamless Wi-Fi network. Can it really offer such an advantage over your bog-standard Modem/router combo?

 
##   Design: Attractive and well ventilated  
 

With an unassuming yet slick look, the Linksys Velop’s diminutive nodes fit in easily with any decor. Two sides are a blank white surface, while the other two and the top are ventilated to release the heat generated by the router. The two ethernet ports on each node, as well as the power switch, reset button, and power adapter port are located in a recessed cavity on the underside of the nodes. Cables are routed out through a triangular slot in the back of the nodes. Power adapters and ethernet cables are included with each node.

 
##   Setup process: An exercise in patience  
 

Like many other modern Wi-Fi routers, setting up the Linksys Velop is all done through the mobile app. Once installed, the Linksys app quickly detected the first Velop node after I’d plugged in its ethernet cable and power adapter. However, I had significant difficulty getting the Velop to connect to my modem. The app initially failed to pick up an internet signal and had me fully power off my modem for a full two minutes. I went through this process several times without success. I tried reaching out to Linksys technical support to get it up and running, but their advice got me nowhere. 

 

Finally, after two days of frustration, I reset the router one last time and it just worked, as if it knew I was about to give up on it and had decided it had inflicted enough torture upon me. I was able to create an account and set up the network easily after this, though getting each node connected required a lot of patience. In addition to the lengthy wait required to connect each note, the entire system initiated a major update that added yet more time to the installation process.

It should also be noted that the color-coding of the indicator light with blue, purple, and red increased the difficulty for me, as my colorblindness made distinguishing the different signals challenging.

 
##   Connectivity: Long-range consistency  
 

While using the Linksys Velop, my Wi-Fi signal never dropped in strength within my 4,000 square foot home, and the Linksys Velop could easily provide an acceptable network throughout a much larger building. I was able to easily connect to the internet from anywhere within my yard, and if somehow the three Velop units aren’t enough you can always buy a fourth to expand your network.

 

Since I have a slow DSL connection speed, I was unable to test the upper limits of the Velop’s speed capabilities. However, in my tests, I did find that it was able to take full advantage of my connection and in fact, outdid connecting an ethernet connection directly to my router. Speeds were consistent throughout my home, though they started to drop off once I went outdoors and put considerable obstacles between me and the router nodes.

 
The triband hybrid mesh network produced by the Velop did a good job of eliminating dead zones within my house.
 

The triband hybrid mesh network, which uses a dynamic combination of 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz networks, produced by the Velop did a good job of eliminating dead zones within my house. This seamless connection is certainly aided by each node’s array of 6 internal antennas.

 
##   Software: Easy to use but ads are annoying.  
 

However, some features are annoyingly gated behind a paywall, and the app actively advertises these subscription services to you. The first of these extra features that you have to pay for concerns about parental control. While you can pause internet access for a certain device, schedule internet access pauses, and block specific websites, you have to pay $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year if you want to block websites by category. 

 

There’s also Linksys Aware, which senses motion in your home using your Wi-Fi network and alerts you if an intruder is detected. However, that will cost you $2.99 per month or $24.99 per year. It may not sound like much for either of these services, but those costs add up over the course of a few years, and it’s easy to forget that you’re paying such auto-renewing subscriptions.

 
##   Price: A bit steep  
 

With an MSRP of $400, the Linksys Velop is quite a pricey Wi-Fi system to invest in. Also, if you want some of the exciting added features, you’ll be paying extra for those optional services. It’s a little galling to be asked to pay extra for features when the base system is so expensive.

 
##   Linksys Velop vs. TP-Link Deco P9  
 

The TP-Link Deco P9 is an attractive budget alternative to the Linksys Velop. The Deco 9 was quick and easy to set up, whereas the Velop was a pain to get up and running. The Deco P9 is also almost half the price of the Velop and provides a similar degree of performance. However, I found that Deco P9 was prone to overheating and occasional signal loss, while the Velop stayed reassuringly cool and provided an absolute rock-solid signal.

The Linksys Velop is an expensive, but powerful and reliable mesh Wi-Fi system with a few irritating issues.
