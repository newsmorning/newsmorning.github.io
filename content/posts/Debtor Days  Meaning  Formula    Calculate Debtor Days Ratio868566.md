# Unlock the Secret to Maximizing Profits with This Simple Debtor Days Calculation Formula!

As a business owner, one of your primary goals is to maximize profits. But how do you accomplish that? One simple and effective way is to manage your cash flow. One critical aspect of cash flow management is managing your receivables, which is where the debtor days calculation formula comes into play. In this article, we will explain what this formula is, how it works, and how you can use it to optimize your cash flow and maximize profits.

## What is the debtor days calculation formula?

Debtor days refer to the time it takes for a customer to pay a company after they receive goods or services. The debtor days calculation formula is a simple equation that helps you determine your average collection period. It is calculated by dividing your accounts receivable balance by your average daily sales.

## How does it work?

Let's say you have an average accounts receivable balance of $10,000, and your average daily sales are $1,000. Your debtor days calculation formula would be:

Debtor Days = (Accounts Receivable Balance / Average Daily Sales) 

Debtor Days = ($10,000 / $1,000)

Debtor Days = 10

So, with this formula, you can see that, on average, it takes you ten days to collect on your outstanding receivables.

## Why is it important?

Knowing your debtor days is essential because it helps you manage your cash flow. The longer it takes for a customer to pay you, the longer you have to wait to receive the cash. This delay can impact your cash flow and create a strain on your business. By calculating your debtor days, you can identify any trends or delays in receiving payments, which allows you to take corrective action to optimize your cash flow.

Additionally, by monitoring your debtor days, you can identify high-risk customers who consistently take longer to pay. This information is relevant because it helps you decide whether to extend credit to them, demand payment upfront, or offer them a discount for early payment.

## How can you use it to maximize profits?

One way to maximize profits is to reduce your debtor days. A shorter debtor day's means that you can collect your payments quicker, improving your cash flow, and reducing your risk of bad debt. By sending out invoices promptly and following up with customers who are taking longer to pay, you can speed up your collection process and increase your cash flow.

Another way to use the debtor day's calculation formula to maximize profits is to identify opportunities for discounts for early payment. By offering customers an incentive to pay early, you can reduce your overall debtor days, increase your cash flow and improve your customer relationships.

## Conclusion

Understanding and managing your debtor days is crucial for optimizing your cash flow and maximizing profits. By using the straightforward debtor days calculation formula, you can track your average collection period and make data-driven decisions to improve your cash flow. By reducing your debtor days, you can also reduce your overall risk, create financial stability, and put your business in a position to succeed.

### Explanation
 
### Examples of Debtor Days Formula (with Excel Template)
 
Let’s see some simple to advanced examples of Debtor Days Calculation to understand it better. 
 
- Firstly, determine the average accounts receivable of the company. The average accounts receivable is computed by adding the receivable amount at the beginning of the year with that of the end of the year and then dividing the result by two. Both information can be collected from the balance sheet of the companyBalance Sheet Of The CompanyA balance sheet is one of the financial statements of a company that presents the shareholders' equity, liabilities, and assets of the company at a specific point in time. It is based on the accounting equation that states that the sum of the total liabilities and the owner's capital equals the total assets of the company.read more. Average accounts receivable = (Opening accounts receivable + Closing accounts receivable) / 2 Next, determine the total annual sales of the company, which is easily available as a line item in the income statementIncome StatementThe income statement is one of the company's financial reports that summarizes all of the company's revenues and expenses over time in order to determine the company's profit or loss and measure its business activity over time based on user requirements.read more of the company. Further, the average daily sales can also be calculated by dividing the annual total sales by 365 days (number of days in a year). Average daily sales = Annual total sales / 365 Finally, the debtor days ratio calculation is done by dividing the average accounts receivable by the total annual sales and then multiply by 365 days. Receivable Days Formula can also be calculated by dividing the average accounts receivable by the average daily sales. Debtor days formula = (Average accounts receivable / Annual total sales) * 365 daysorDebtor days Ratio Calculation = (Average accounts receivable / Average daily sales)

 
Average accounts receivable = (Opening accounts receivable + Closing accounts receivable) / 2
 
Average daily sales = Annual total sales / 365
 
Debtor days formula = (Average accounts receivable / Annual total sales) * 365 daysorDebtor days Ratio Calculation = (Average accounts receivable / Average daily sales)
 
#### Example#1
 
Let us take David’s example, a garment retailer who often offers credit to his customers. David is known for selling to customers on credit with the expectation that these customers would pay back for the merchandise within the next 30 days. Although most customers pay for their goods promptly, some are late. Calculate the debtor days ratio considering that at the end of the financial year, the statements recorded the following accounts:
 
Given,
 
- Average Accounts Receivable: $30,000Annual total sales: $210,000

 
Below is given data for calculation of Days Sales Outstanding
 
Therefore, Debtor Days can be calculated as,
 
DSO = (Average accounts receivable / Annual total sales) * 365 days
 
= ($30,000 / $210,000) * 365 days
 
The DSO has gone up to 52 days due to some delinquent customers.
 
#### Example#2
 
Let us take another example of ABC Ltd, which reported a total annual sales of $2,500,000 for 31st December 2016. The accounts receivable at the beginning of the year was $900,000, and the balance at the year closing was $700,000. Determine the Days Sales Outstanding of ABC Ltd based on the given information.
 
- Total annual sales = $2,500,000Average accounts receivable   = ($900,000 + $700,000) / 2 = $800,000

 
Given the table shows data for the calculation of Debtor Days Ratio of company ABC Ltd.
 
Therefore, DSO for ABC Ltd can be calculated as,
 
Days Sales Outstanding = (Average accounts receivable / Annual total sales) * 365 days
 
= ($800,000 / $2,500,000) * 365 days
 
Days Sales Outstanding for ABC Ltd will be –
 
DSO = 116.8 days ~ 117 days

### Relevance and Use
 
It is very important for a company because the debtor days ratio increases beyond the stated trading terms. It can be indicative of the fact that either the company cannot collect its debts from customers efficiently enough or maybe that the terms are being changed to boost sales. A lower debtor day is favorable as it indicates that the company can collect the cash earlier from customers and that the accounts receivables are good, which means that it is not required to be written off as bad debtsBad DebtsBad Debts can be described as unforeseen loss incurred by a business organization on account of non-fulfillment of agreed terms and conditions on account of sale of goods or services or repayment of any loan or other obligation.read more.
 
On the other hand, if there is an upward trend witnessed in the debtor ratio, then an increasing amount of cash is required in the form of working capital to finance the business, which can be a problem for growing businesses. However, it is important to note that the average varies from industry to industry, although most businesses complain that debtors usually take too long to pay in almost every market.
 
Nevertheless, Days Sales Outstanding also comes with limitations, such as an analyst should compare it for companies within the same industry. Ideally, if the companies have the same business model and revenue, a comparison makes more sense.
