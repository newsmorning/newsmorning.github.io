League of Legends is one of the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games in the world. The game has fascinated gamers with its engaging gameplay, stunning graphics, and immersive storyline. With millions of players around the globe, the game has become a cultural phenomenon. However, nothing is more frustrating than experiencing connection issues when playing League of Legends. As a player, your gaming experience can be marred by slow connection, frequent disconnection, and lag spikes. This article will discuss some solutions to help you fix the connection problems that you may be experiencing while playing League of Legends.

## Diagnose the Problem

The first step in fixing a connection issue is to identify the source of the problem. There are various reasons why you may be experiencing connection problems with League of Legends. It can be due to server issues, outdated drivers, or an unstable internet connection. Therefore, before implementing any solution, it is essential to diagnose the core of the problem. 

## Check Your Internet Connection

The most common reason for experiencing connection issues while playing League of Legends is an unstable internet connection. A weak signal or slow internet speed can cause the game to disconnect, and the gameplay may become unresponsive. You can check your internet speed by running online speed tests. The ideal internet speed for playing League of Legends should not be less than 6 Mbps for download and 1 Mbps for upload. If you experience slow internet speed, contact your internet service provider (ISP) or troubleshoot the problem yourself by following the troubleshooting steps.

## Update Your Drivers

Outdated drivers can also lead to connection problems. It is essential to ensure that your drivers are up to date. You can do this by checking your device manager and updating the drivers. You can also use various third-party applications to manage and update your drivers.

## Configure Your Firewall

Your firewall can also affect your ability to connect to the League of Legends servers. Therefore, it is essential to configure your firewall settings to allow the game to communicate with the server. You can add the game to the whitelist in the firewall settings to ensure that it is always allowed through.

## Use a VPN

Sometimes, the connection issues experienced while playing League of Legends may be due to server-side problems. In this case, using a virtual private network (VPN) can help bypass the issue. A VPN can also help reduce lag and prevent frequent disconnections.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, connection problems can be frustrating when playing League of Legends. However, with the solutions discussed in this article, you should be able to fix most of the connection issues that you may be experiencing. It is essential to identify the source of the problem and apply the necessary solution to get the best gaming experience.

Most often, using a VPN will pretty much always solve lag spikes and issues in games, as well as deal with common connection errors such as packet losses.
 
In the case of League of Legends, one great product worth trying is Speedify, a VPN service that makes your online experiences faster, more reliable, and more secure.
 
Besides, even when you’re not playing LoL, you can still use SPeedify from streaming content, safe browsing, and more, all at speeds that make you forget that you are using a VPN in the first place.
 
### 2. Check your server current status
 
### Speedify
 
 If you want to win matches in the Summoner's Rift without any lag, then Speedify is the VPN that you need in your life!

 
First and foremost, you should check the external source that can cause connectivity problems. In particular, the closest server status. You can do that by following this link and selecting the server you used to connect to. If the server is active, we can move on to internal issues.
 
### Switch to LAN cable instead of Wi-Fi
 
Wi-Fi connection will work well for web browsing or social media. However, online gaming requires wired connections in order to experience stable FPS without annoying spikes.
 
So, if there is a possibility to connect to a wired connection, do so.
 
### Make firewall exception or disable the firewall
 
A firewall is a security measure that protects your PC from both outgoing and incoming unwanted communications. In other words, the first line of defense. Nevertheless, sometimes it blocks applications that are harmless.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.
