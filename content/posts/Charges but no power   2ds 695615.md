You Won't Believe Why These 2Ds Have Charges But No Power...The Shocking Truth Will Leave You Speechless!

Have you ever come across a device with a battery indicator showing full charge, but it just wouldn't power on? The answer might surprise you. It turns out that some devices can have a charge but no power. This anomaly is most common in devices that use rechargeable batteries such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. But why does this happen? Read on to find out.

The first thing to understand is that the charge and the power of a battery are two different things. The charge is the amount of electrical energy stored in a battery, which is measured in volts. The power, on the other hand, is the rate at which the battery delivers energy to the device, which is measured in watts. In simple terms, the charge determines how much energy a battery can hold, while the power determines how fast the battery can deliver that energy.

Now, here's where things get interesting. When a device is plugged in to charge, it uses a charger to supply power to the battery. The charger's job is to send a constant flow of electricity to the battery until it reaches full charge. When the battery is fully charged, the charger stops sending power, and the device shows a full charge.

However, this does not mean that the device has power. When a device is turned on, it uses power from the battery to operate. If the battery is fully charged, but the device is not operating, it means that the battery is not sending power to the device.

One reason why this might happen is if the battery is damaged. A damaged battery can hold a charge, but it may not be able to deliver power. This is because the damaged cells inside the battery cannot release electricity. In some cases, the damaged cells can cause the battery to overheat or swell, which can be dangerous.

Another reason why a battery can have a charge but no power is if the device's software is malfunctioning. This can happen if the device's battery management software is not calibrated correctly, causing it to shut down the device prematurely, even when the battery still has power.

In conclusion, having a device with a charged battery but no power can be frustrating, but it's not a rare occurrence. The key is to understand that the charge and the power of a battery are two different things. A battery can hold a charge, but if it is damaged or if the device's software is malfunctioning, it may not be able to deliver that charge as power. Next time your device refuses to turn on, check your battery health and software calibration. You may just find the solution to your problem!

## Chosen Solution
 I have a 2ds I have recently turned on and worked perfectly I stopped using it for a few months and now it doesnâ€™t turn on it it starts to charge but then stops and sometimes does charge but when it does charge I get no power when I try and turn it on

 firstly, does the 2DS power on when plugged into power?
If it is working on power but not when unpluged you likely have a bad battery. you can take this out and measure it with a multi meter to see how much charge it is holding, batteries in DS's and other electronic devices can go "low" meaning they want charge properly and never store enough power without being charged by an external charging station.
If its dead/dead, then refer to some of the troubleshooting guides on this website.
