Dell’s recent releases of 15 and 17 inch Alienware laptops have brought the much-needed agility and flexibility in gaming laptops. The thinner, modern and VR ready gaming ware are packed with whizz-bang nimble features.
 
Dell announced their powerful gaming notebooks at PAX West in Seattle. The main attractions include the additional support of the latest NVIDIA laptop cards, GeForce GTX 10-Series family of GPU which provide a desktop standard, graphic experience. Both releases have received massive recognition among the users, not just on their eye-catching frame design but also for their prominent features.
 
For starters, we can see that Dell has hauled some liberal inspiration from their competitors like Gigabyte’s Aorus series of notebooks but all the while establishing their own unique identity. The latest design features the screen hinge, moved a few millimeters forward towards the keyboard deck and gives more room to the heat vents and giving an overall thinner body – 25% thinner as the company claims. Dell has used improved thermal management components to increase the overall performance of the components and to enhance the durability and firmness of the Alienware aesthetics.
 
The gaming platform also features an improved keyboard with TactX keys borrowed from its own lineup of desktop gaming keyboards. This latest technology offers a deeper 2.2mm of travel for punchier feedback and N-Key rollover, which records simultaneous keystrokes better and eliminates the chance of ‘ghosting’ or unregistered keystrokes.
 
Dell Alienware 17:
 
Dell’s new flagship Alienware 17 Notebook is clocked with sixth-generation Intel Core i7 CPUs (not the next-gen “Kaby Lake“) is getting an overclocked, “k-series” option and DDR4 memory running up to 2667 Mhz.
 
Another additional spec is the introduction of optional IR Tobii eye-tracking technology that is like a blessing for pro gamers. It enables them to track their eye-gaze and record it via the new Overwolf app and then can replay the pattern to further improvise their gaming skills. Dell pairing up with Tobii as their partner brings a whole lot more to the table which includes enhanced presence detection; tied to iconic AlienFX lighting zones that help the firmware understand when the user is most attentive by a LED illuminating system and what various elements of the game, engages user the most.
