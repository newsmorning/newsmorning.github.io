You can then save the email as a PDF file and access it anytime you want, even if you no longer have access to the original email account.

## 4. Creating Digital Copies of Documents

Instead of scanning documents into your computer or taking pictures of them, Print to PDF allows you to create digital copies of your documents. Simply place your document on a scanner and select "Microsoft Print to PDF" as your printer. The document will then be scanned and saved as a PDF file, giving you a digital copy that's easier to store and manage.
