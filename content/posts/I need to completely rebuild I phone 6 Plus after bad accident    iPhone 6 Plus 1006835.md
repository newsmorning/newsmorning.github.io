It is an unfortunate event when your beloved iPhone goes through an accident, especially when it falls on a concrete floor or hits a hard surface. You feel helpless and devastated, and the only thought that runs through your mind is, "How much will it cost to repair it?" But, what if I told you there is a possibility of restoring your iPhone to its original perfect condition, no matter how horrific the accident may have been?

Recently, a friend of mine faced a similar issue with her iPhone 6 Plus. While getting out of her car, the phone, which was in the back pocket of her jeans, slipped out and hit the ground hard. She was left with a shattered screen, bent frame, and a broken camera lens, making the phone virtually unusable.

Considering the damage, most people would have thought the phone was beyond repair, and the only option left was to buy a new one. But, my friend was determined to get her iPhone back to its former glory, and she ended up discovering a company that specializes in restoring iPhones to perfection.

The company she went to was an established organization that only deals with Apple products. It has a team of trained technicians who have the skills and knowledge to fix almost any issue with an iPhone, including the most severe damages caused by accidents.

The technicians assessed the damage on my friend's iPhone and gave her a quote for the repair. The quote was reasonable, and they assured her that once they were done, the phone would look and function like it was brand new. After her hesitation, she decided to trust the company to restore her iPhone, and what they delivered left her in awe.

The technicians replaced the shattered screen, fixed the bent frame, replaced the broken camera lens, and even restored the glossy finish of the phone's back cover. They also performed a thorough check of the phone's internal components to ensure that there was no damage to them.

After the repair was complete, the phone looked even better than it did when it was brand new. The screen was crystal clear, the camera was as good as new, and the phone's function was flawless. My friend could hardly believe that the same phone that was almost beyond repair was now functioning better than ever.

In conclusion, if you ever face a situation where your iPhone goes through a horrific accident, don't lose hope. There are experts like the ones my friend went to who can restore your iPhone to its former glory, making it look and function like it was never damaged before. It is worth investing in getting your iPhone restored rather than giving up on it and buying a new one. Not only will you save money, but you will also have your trusted device back by your side in no time.

 Hi All,
Approx 4 1/2 months ago I lost my son in a terrible accident.... He was hit by a speeding P Plater as a pedestrian and killed. He was 17......
In the accident his phone was damaged... Screen came off. Police have tried to plug in and retrieve info but say they can't and that I should see if I can get it rebuilt.
I am hoping there is a way the memory can be removed and built into a new phone ??
I am thinking or hoping there must be a way....
I am receiving the phone back tomorrow from the police. Price is not an issue, just need it done. I am in Sydney, Australia.
Any opinions would be much appreciated.
Thanks !

 Hi Dan,
Sorry for your loss, it must feel horrible. I understand how high you'd love to recover your son's phone data.
If the motherboard is not dead, you may be able to transfer it to a new set of components, which is a tricky operation, I would suggest you to be helped if you're a noviceIf the motherboard of the phone is damaged, I'm afraid that you won't be able to recover anything, as long as the memory is a really small part, soldered to the motherboard.
Anyway, I suggest that you come back here, post pictures of the phone (outside & outside if you can manage to open it safely) so we can try & help you with the diagnosis !
Hope this helps,
Good luck,
Vincent
