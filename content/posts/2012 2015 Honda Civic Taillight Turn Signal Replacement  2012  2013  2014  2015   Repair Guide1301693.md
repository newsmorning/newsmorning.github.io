# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Fix Your Honda Civic Taillight Turn Signal with this 2012-2015 Repair Guide!

If you own a Honda Civic with a broken taillight turn signal, you might think that fixing it requires a trip to the mechanic or a replacement part. However, with the right tools and a little know-how, you can save time and money by repairing the turn signal yourself. In this article, we'll provide a step-by-step guide for fixing a taillight turn signal on a Honda Civic made between 2012 and 2015.

Before you begin, you'll need a few tools and supplies to make the repair: a Phillips head screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, needle-nose pliers, a new turn signal bulb (available at most auto parts stores), and a clean cloth or rag.

Step 1: Remove the Taillight Assembly

The first step is to remove the taillight assembly from the car. To do this, open the trunk lid and locate the two screws on the inside edge of the taillight assembly. Use the Phillips head screwdriver to remove these screws, and gently pull the taillight assembly away from the car. If the assembly is stuck, use the flathead screwdriver to gently pry it away from the car.

Step 2: Remove the Old Turn Signal Bulb

Once the taillight assembly is removed, locate the turn signal bulb socket on the back of the assembly. Gently turn the socket counterclockwise to remove it from the assembly. Using the needle-nose pliers, gently remove the old turn signal bulb from the socket.

Step 3: Replace the Turn Signal Bulb

Take the new turn signal bulb and insert it into the bulb socket. Be careful not to touch the glass part of the bulb with your fingers, as this can cause the bulb to burn out prematurely. Once the new bulb is securely in place, reattach the bulb socket to the taillight assembly by turning it clockwise.

Step 4: Reattach the Taillight Assembly

With the new turn signal bulb in place, reattach the taillight assembly to the car. Insert the assembly back into the car and align it with the screw holes. Use the Phillips head screwdriver to reattach the two screws on the inside edge of the assembly. Close the trunk lid.

Step 5: Test the Turn Signal

To ensure that the turn signal is working properly, turn on the car's ignition and activate the turn signal switch. Walk around to the back of the car and confirm that the taillight turn signal is functioning correctly.

With these easy-to-follow steps, you can fix a broken taillight turn signal on your Honda Civic without the expense of taking it to a mechanic. By saving time and money on this simple repair, you'll have more money to spend on the road ahead!

## Introduction
 
The turn signal allows you to communicate with other drivers on the road when you are turning, merging lanes, or (if both turn signals are used together) that you are in a hazardous situation and other drivers should use caution. If one of these turn signals are out, it could lead to miscommunication and dangerous consequences on the road.
 
Before utilizing this guide, ensure that the blown turn signal bulb is in one of the rear taillights. This guide is not for headlight bulbs. Ensure that all other turn signals and other bulbs in the taillight are working to ensure that it is indeed just a blown bulb.
