## Chosen Solution
 On my MI 9,  the front glass is broken. The AMOLED display is still working, there are no pixel errors and the touch is working well. Is it possible to change only the front glass and not the whole AMOLED dislpay?

 Maybe yes and maybe it will cost half of the price

 It’s possible, however really hard, and you might end up permanently damaging the display and digitizer while performing the repair.

 Thank you for your help, I bought a new display now
