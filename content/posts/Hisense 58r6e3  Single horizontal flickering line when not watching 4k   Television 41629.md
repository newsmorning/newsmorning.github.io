## Chosen Solution
 Purchased a Hisense 58r6e3 4k TV a few weeks back. Recently we have noticed a horizontal, flickering line about 2 inches from the top of the tv when watching certain content. It seems to only affect anything that is not in 4k quality…

 Andrew French  horizontal lines are almost entirely caused by bad drivers on the panel itself. 4K or not it should not have any lines. Since this is a new TV I’d get it repaired/replaced under warranty.
