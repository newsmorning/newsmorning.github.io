As an owner of a 2018 Ford Focus St, you may have experienced some trouble with the positive crankcase ventilation plate gasket. The positive crankcase ventilation system in your car helps to regulate the pressure in the engine and reduce emissions, and the gasket is an essential part of this system. Over time, this gasket can degrade, leading to engine issues and poor performance.

While having issues with your car's engine can be frustrating, the good news is that replacing the positive crankcase ventilation plate gasket on your 2018 Ford Focus St is incredibly easy. In this article, we will go over the steps to replace this gasket and get your car running smoothly once again.

Step 1: Gather Your Tools

Before you begin, you'll need the proper tools for the job. Here's what you'll need:

- Socket wrench set
- Screwdriver set
- Pliers
- New positive crankcase ventilation plate gasket

Step 2: Locate the Positive Crankcase Ventilation Plate

The positive crankcase ventilation plate is located on the driver's side of the engine. You can find it by looking for a circular plate with four bolts holding it in place. Once you've located it, use your socket wrench to remove the bolts and take off the plate.

Step 3: Remove the Old Gasket

Behind the plate, you'll see the old gasket. Use your pliers to carefully remove it from the engine. Make sure to be gentle as you don't want to scratch or damage the engine's surface.

Step 4: Install the New Gasket

Now that the old gasket is removed, it's time to install the new one. The new gasket should fit securely around the plate's edge. Make sure to press it firmly into place, so it doesn't move around when you reattach the plate.

Step 5: Reattach the Positive Crankcase Ventilation Plate

With the new gasket installed, it's time to reattach the plate. Line up the four bolt holes and use your socket wrench to tighten them back into place. Make sure to tighten each bolt evenly to ensure a tight seal.

Step 6: Test Your Work

Once you've reattached the plate, start your car and make sure there are no leaks or strange noises coming from the engine. If you notice any issues, double-check to make sure the gasket is installed correctly and completely sealed.

Conclusion

Replacing the positive crankcase ventilation plate gasket on your 2018 Ford Focus St is an easy task that any car owner can perform. By following these steps, you can ensure your car continues to perform smoothly and efficiently. Remember, proper maintenance of your car's engine is essential to ensuring it lasts for many years.
