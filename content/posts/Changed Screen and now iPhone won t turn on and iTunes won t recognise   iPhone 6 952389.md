Title: iPhone 6 Screen Swap Gone Wrong! Find Out Why It Won't Turn On And iTunes Can't Recognize It!

Have you recently swapped your iPhone 6's screen and now you are facing issues with turning on your phone and not being able to connect it to iTunes? You are not alone. Screen swaps can go wrong easily, and it can be frustrating when you can't find a solution to the problem. In this article, we will discuss some common reasons why your iPhone 6 won't turn on and why iTunes can't recognize it after a screen swap.

1. Damaged Screen Connector

One of the most common reasons why your iPhone 6 won't turn on after a screen swap is a damaged screen connector. It's easy to damage the connectors while removing the old screen or fitting the new one. Nudging the connectors or removing them can disconnect these tiny wires, and your phone won't be able to communicate with the screen or the circuit board.

2. Battery Disconnection

Another reason why your iPhone 6 may not turn on after a screen swap is a disconnected battery. While removing or installing the screen, it's easy to accidentally unplug the battery from the logic board. As a result, your phone will not have any power supply, and it won't turn on even if you press the power button.

3. Damaged Logic Board

In rare cases, poorly executed screen swaps can also damage the logic board of your iPhone 6. This usually happens when the screws are tightened too much, and the board is bent or warped. A damaged logic board can cause a slew of problems, including failure to turn on, failure to charge, and data loss.

4. Software Issues

If your iPhone 6 turns on but can't connect to iTunes after a screen swap, it's possible that the software was damaged during the repair. This could happen if the firmware wasn't updated or if a software update was interrupted mid-way. In such cases, a restore through iTunes might be the only solution.

What Can You Do?

If you're in a situation where your iPhone 6 won't turn on after a screen swap or iTunes can't recognize it, here are a few things you can do:

1. Recheck all the connections and make sure they are plugged in correctly.

2. Try resetting your iPhone 6 by holding the power button and the home button simultaneously.

3. Check the battery connection and make sure it's not loose or disconnected.

4. Check if the connectors are damaged and if they are, replace them.

5. Check if the logic board is damaged and if it is, a professional may need to step in to help you repair it.

6. Use a different USB cable or port and try to connect your phone to iTunes again.

7. Try putting your phone in DFU mode and restoring it through iTunes.

Conclusion

Swapping an iPhone 6 screen can be a tricky job, and sometimes things can go wrong. However, with the right tools and instructions, you can repair your phone easily. If you're unsure about swapping your iPhone 6 screen by yourself, it's always better to seek professional help to avoid any further damage. Remember, prevention is always better than cure!

## Chosen Solution
 Changed my phone screen today as i was assembling it the screen was on but had rectangular shapes at top of screen so i took it apart then back together and it was fine, as i put the screws in for the shield the phone went off, the apple logo then showed and then blank again. phone was dead for ages tried everything. anyway put it back together and left it on charge and somehow after around 45 mins it came on randomly at 61%. It then worked fine for about 30 mins before turning off again and is now dead. Any ideas? I'm thinking either Long screw damage or bigger fault, i just want it back on long enough to back it up or even work fine again. Thanks

 Have you checked for water damage or that all the connectors are seated properly and the right screws are in? Even using a different screw can make it short out!
