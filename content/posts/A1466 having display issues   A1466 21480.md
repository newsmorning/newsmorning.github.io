# Is Your A1466 MacBook Air Display Flickering? Here's the Quick Fix You Need!

If you own a MacBook Air with a model number A1466, you may have experienced screen flickering. This issue is more common than you might think, but don't fret! There are simple solutions that can get your MacBook Air back to its typical, reliable self.

## What Is Screen Flickering?

Screen flickering is when your MacBook Air's display flashes or blinks while you're using it. It can occur at any time, whether you're browsing the web, working on a document, watching a video, or simply scrolling through social media feeds.

Screen flickering can be caused by a multitude of issues, from software problems to hardware malfunctions. In most cases, it's a software issue, which can be fixed with a few easy steps.

## Causes of Screen Flickering

As mentioned, screen flickering on your MacBook Air A1466 can be caused by various factors. Below are some common causes:

### Software Issues

Software conflicts, bugs, and glitches could be the reason behind your flickering screen. This can be fixed by updating your macOS or resetting the NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory).

### Graphics Card Issues

The graphics card, a vital component in any computer, controls how images are displayed on your screen. A faulty graphics card could be causing your screen to flicker. Make sure to update the driver software to the latest version to fix this issue.

### Hardware Issues

Having a loose or faulty display connector can also be the reason behind your screen flickering. However, it's best to let a professional handle this issue to avoid causing more damage to your MacBook Air.

## Quick Fixes for Screen Flickering

If you're still experiencing a flickering screen, don't worry; there are a few quick remedies you can try.

### Reset the SMC

The system management controller (SMC) is a component in your MacBook Air that regulates power settings and other hardware features. Here's how to reset it:

1. Turn off your MacBook Air
2. Hold down the shift, control, and option keys, along with the power button, for about 10 seconds
3. Release the keys
4. Power on your MacBook Air again.

### Reset the NVRAM

Another component that could be causing screen flickering is the NVRAM. Resetting it could resolve the issue. Here's how:

1. Shut down your MacBook Air
2. Press the power button to turn on your MacBook Air and immediately hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys until the Apple logo appears
3. Release the keys and let your MacBook Air reboot.

### Update your macOS

Updating your macOS could fix screen flickering issues, especially when caused by software glitches. Here's how to update your macOS:

1. Click on the Apple icon on the top left corner of your screen
2. From the drop-down menu, select System Preferences
3. Click on Software Update
4. Click on Update Now to install the latest version of macOS.

## Final Thoughts

Screen flickering on your MacBook Air could be caused by various issues, from hardware to software problems. The good news is that most cases can be fixed with a few simple steps. If your screen continues to flicker, you may need to take your MacBook Air to a professional repair service. However, before that, try the above solutions and see if they work for you.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi there. I have a A1466 with no display but it works perfectly with external display. It should not be the screen problem as I saw the screen works just once, so I guess it maybe video cable or something.  Anyone knows which part may go wrong?  Regards.

 There are nine A1466 from 2012 to 2015, which one are you teaching help with:
