Title: You Won't Believe How Simple It Is to Fix Your Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S Proximity Sensor - Learn How Now!

Introduction:

The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S is a premium smartphone with some of the best features and specifications in its category. It has an excellent display, powerful processor, and great cameras. However, some users have reported issues with its proximity sensor, which can make it difficult to use certain apps or take calls. Thankfully, fixing the proximity sensor issue is straightforward and simple, and in this article, we will show you how to do it.

Step 1: Clean the Proximity Sensor

The first thing you need to do is to clean the proximity sensor. Dust, dirt, and debris can accumulate on the sensor, which can interfere with its functioning. To clean the sensor, you need a soft, dry cloth or a cotton swab. Gently wipe the sensor to remove any dirt or residue. Make sure you don't apply too much pressure or use any liquid as it can damage the phone.

Step 2: Check the Screen Protector

If you have a screen protector on your Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S, it may be interfering with the proximity sensor. Some screen protectors have a coating that can block the sensor, making it difficult to use. Check if your screen protector is causing the issue by removing it temporarily and testing the proximity sensor. If the sensor works fine without the screen protector, then you need to replace it with a new one.

Step 3: Check for Software Issues

If the above steps don't fix the proximity sensor issue, there may be a software issue causing the problem. First, make sure your phone is running the latest software update. You can check for the update in the settings menu under the system update section. If an update is available, download and install it.

If the issue persists even after updating your phone, you can try resetting the proximity sensor settings. Go to the phone's settings, select the "Additional Settings" option, and tap "Proximity Sensor." Here, you will find the option to reset the Proximity Sensor settings. Tap on it, and the phone will reset the sensor's settings to default.

Step 4: Visit a Professional

If none of the above steps work, then it is best to take your phone to a professional to have it checked. There may be a hardware issue, which requires a technician's expertise to fix. It is always better to get a professional to fix your phone so that you don't damage it further.

Conclusion:

Fixing the proximity sensor issue on your Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S is easy, and you don't need any special tools or technical expertise to do it. In most cases, simply cleaning the sensor or removing the screen protector can fix the problem. If there's a software issue, resetting the settings or updating the software can help. However, if the problem persists, it's best to take your phone to a professional for a thorough investigation. With these steps, you can easily fix the proximity sensor issue and get back to enjoying your phone's excellent features.

## Chosen Solution
 Can the proximity sensor be changed or it's soldered in the mainboard?

 Hello. The lower PS / light sensor comes on a flex cable which can be replaced. It is at the bottom of the device behind the little circuit board that has the charge port and microphone on it.
There could possibly be another PS at the top of the phone which is an ultrasonic PS and I do not believe that it is replaceable, but I could be wrong.
