If you're a tech-savvy person like me, then you know that smartphones are pretty delicate gadgets that require careful handling. Even the slightest mistake can cause severe damage to the device's hardware, which could cut short the lifespan of the phone. That's why you should always pay attention to small details like loose screws, especially if you're trying to repair or upgrade your phone's hardware.

I learned this lesson the hard way when I was trying to replace the battery of my trusty Oneplus One smartphone. Everything was going smoothly until I accidentally dropped one of the screws that held the motherboard in place. At first, I thought it was no big deal; I'm a careful person, and I always work on a clean surface, so I was sure I could find the screw easily. However, after a few minutes of searching, I realized that the screw was nowhere to be found. That's when the panic set in.

I knew I had to act fast, so I turned to my friend Google for some help. I searched for terms like "lost screw motherboard phone," and I found an overwhelming number of forums and articles about how a tiny screw could cause significant damage to a phone's hardware. Some people reported issues like battery drain, overheating, and even motherboards frying because of a single missing screw. I was terrified.

At that point, I had two options: I could take my phone to a professional repair shop and hope that they could fix the problem, or I could try to fix it myself. Since I'm a DIY enthusiast and I had some experience working on smartphones, I decided to give it a shot. I read up on the subject and found out that the missing screw could cause the motherboard to bend or warp, which could lead to short circuits and other problems. So, I made sure to secure the remaining screws as tightened as possible.

I was nervous as I started my phone, half expecting it to not work at all. But to my surprise, everything seemed to be working fine! My phone was running smoothly, and the battery was holding its charge. I breathed a sigh of relief and realized that I had dodged a significant bullet.

That experience taught me one thing: never underestimate the importance of small details like a loose screw. It may seem insignificant, but the consequences could be significant. If you ever find yourself in a situation like mine, don't panic. Take a deep breath, do your research, and do what you can to fix the problem. You might just save yourself a lot of money and time in the long run.

## Chosen Solution
 Despite my magnetic pad-thingy, AND my super-deluxe magnetic screwdriver, I dropped that ONE screw for the motherboard... the one with NO duplicates!
Does it ground the motherboard, or am I able to complete repair without it?

 Hi Mike,
Sorry I don't have your answer but I was wondering if you ever found out the answer.  I too lost my motherboard screw. Don't know how it happened because I put the motherboard in a rubbermaid container labeled "motherboard and screw" but somehow the screw is gone.  Ahhhg!
Thank you!
Valerie

 I lost the screw as well and the device runs fine without it.
