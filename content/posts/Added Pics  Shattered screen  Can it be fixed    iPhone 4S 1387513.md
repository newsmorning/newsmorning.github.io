## Chosen Solution
 Dropped phone from 50'. Can it be fixed? is it just the screen and frame?  How would I know if internal damage has occurred without incurring money spent on replacement parts.
The screen is shattered, the frame of the screen is bulging and it looks like the camera in front is shattered as well.
Help, I want my iPhone back! Thank you to whoever showed me easy way to upload pics.

 Easily fixed if it is only the screen. Find your local iPhone repair person on craigslist if it is out of warranty.
If it is under warranty or not first go to your nearest GENUIS bar sometimes they will just give you a new iPhone free. If they want to charge you alot, look online for a nearby place to get it replaced for Nader $100
