# Unleash the Power of Your Village: Loop Hero's Hidden Secrets to Upgrade Buildings!

Are you addicted to the gaming world of Loop Hero and want to upgrade your buildings to their maximum potential? Do you struggle to find the hidden secrets and strategies to improve your village's strength? Look no further! In this article, we will share with you some powerful tips and tricks to help you unleash your village's power!

First and foremost, remember that building upgrades require specific resources. To acquire the necessary materials, you should keep exploring different terrains and keep track of the resource requirements for each building. The available resources include the necessary stones, logs, and food that can help upgrade the buildings.

But what if you're struggling to find the exact resources and need to upgrade quickly? Here's where the gameplay loop comes in. Your hero's journey affects the progression of the game, and the loop can be maximized to help you get more resources. Explore terrains, fight monsters, add cards, trigger bonuses, and keep expanding your village. The more you progress, the more resources you will acquire. It's all about maintaining the balance between the resources you have and the upgrades you need.

Another vital aspect of upgrading your village is having an accurate plan. Unlike the rushed, disorganized approach that many gamers have, the key to upgrading buildings is to have a well-thought-out plan with a long-term outlook. Don't always go for the most straightforward upgrades, start with structures that will benefit your village's daily life the most. For instance, if your village lacks food, consider upgrading the farms. If you want more supplies, focus on upgrading the logistics center. Plan each step methodically, and it will be easier to achieve little wins that can translate into significant progress.

Also, as simple as it sounds, managing your resources effectively is crucial for steady village upgrades. You need to preserve the resources that you have and spend efficiently. With better resource management, you'll be able to make informed upgrade decisions, use the resources that are vital at a particular time, and upgrade your buildings in the most optimal order.

Finally, keep exploring new terrains to discover hidden secrets, side quests, and more resources than you can fathom. It's essential not to forget the unknown areas behind you because you never know what you might find there!

In conclusion, upgrading buildings in Loop Hero requires strategy, planning, resource management, and exploration. Applying these tips will help you unleash the power of your village and take the game to the next level. Have fun upgrading, and don't forget to let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

The main characteristic of Loop Hero is to go through the same process again & again in a loop to progress ahead in the game. The Hero recalls bits and pieces from his memory and tries to make sense of all of them. Moving along the loops will get you better weapons, resources, gears and more memories manifested as cards in-game. But one of the things you need to change in the game is building a base and upgrading buildings. And the tutorial tells you everything about how to build buildings but nothing about upgrading or demolishing them. So let’s look at how to upgrade buildings in Loop Hero.
 
## How to Upgrade Buildings in Loop Hero?
 
To upgrade building in Loop Hero, you need to select them from your base and select the “Upgrade” option just beside the “Dismantle” option. It’s as simple as that even it might seem a bit confusing at the beginning. And even though the game instructs us about constructing buildings, it doesn’t guide us about upgrading them. At any time of the gameplay, you may return to “Base” to build any new building. But note that all upgrades need resources. And to upgrade all the buildings with their max options you are going to need quite a lot of them.
 

 
Loop Hero combines all the best elements of retro games. It will take you to the old days when you had your 16-bit Fantasy RPG. The gameplay might feel nostalgic, but the idea of the loop is something different from other games. You start by selecting one of the three-class available Warrior, Rogue, and Necromancer. You do not control your hero directly in this game. Your goal is to create a path and fill the world with different elements, which your hero on auto exploration mode loops around again and again. The environmental changes you add determines the health and attack stats of both your hero and the enemies. Among all this chaos, you need to build your base, add buildings to it and also upgrade those buildings to get the best out of them. Enough said! Not spoiling anything more!
