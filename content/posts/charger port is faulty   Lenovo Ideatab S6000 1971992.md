Is Your Lenovo Ideatab S6000 Dying? Find Out if the Charger Port is to Blame!

If you own a Lenovo Ideatab S6000, you might have experienced some issues with charging your device. Sometimes, the tablet won't charge, or it charges very slowly, and you might be wondering if it's time to bid your trusty companion goodbye.

However, before you start shopping for a new tablet, there's one thing you should check â€“ the charger port. Often, the reason behind charging problems is a faulty or damaged charger port, which can easily be fixed by a technician.

So, how can you find out if your charger port is the culprit? Here are some signs that indicate your charger port might be to blame:

1. The tablet won't charge at all or charges very slowly

If you plug in your charger, and your tablet doesn't start charging, or charges very slowly, it's possible that the charger port is obstructed or damaged. You can try using a different charger and see if that helps. If not, it's time to get the charger port checked.

2. The charging cable falls out of the port easily

If the charger cable falls out of the port easily or doesn't stay in place, it's another indication of a faulty charger port. This could be due to a loose connection, a broken lock, or a damaged port. In any case, you'll need to get your port checked.

3. The charger port looks loose or crooked

If you notice that your charger port looks crooked or doesn't sit flush with the tablet, it's another sign of a problem. This could be due to a loose or broken connector inside the port or a damaged port.

So, what should you do if you suspect your charger port is to blame? The best solution is to take your tablet to a reputable technician who can diagnose and fix the issue. Don't attempt to fix it yourself, as it could cause further damage and void your warranty.

In conclusion, charging issues with your Lenovo Ideatab S6000 might not necessarily mean it's time to purchase a new tablet. By checking your charger port for signs of damage, you might be able to save yourself the cost of a new device. Remember to always consult a professional technician for any repairs to ensure that your device is in good hands.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi could you replace the inbuilt charger port as it is intermittent and if so how much please.
Thank's
Derek.

 i've seen the motherboard that the usb (broken off or breaking off inside) attaches to on sale on ebay for 80-100 bucks.
the little usb connector can be bought for 99cents and up, but the soldering job is mighty fine...delicate.
but, the service to repair the ideatab s6000 usb/charging port is also for sale on ebay ...roughly 35 bucks...mail in your device and they fix it.
good luck

 once they have your money the company doesn't give a hoot  about the person who bought it and they no doubt  know that there will be  problems with the usb  ports  but will never tell you.   Will never buy another  Lenovo  and tell people not to buy one. Theyre no good

 Just replaced the usb port on the Levovo. Requires removal of the back, desoldering the right speaker, and removing the motherboard. Be really careful of the flexfilm connector for the display, it is easily torn when removing it (ask me how I know>>). If you have a reworking station with hot air the repair is a breeze after this. I bought one just for this repair and will use it a lot.
