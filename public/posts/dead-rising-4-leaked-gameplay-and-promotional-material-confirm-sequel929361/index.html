It appears that a gameplay leak of Dead Rising 4 has surfaced, revealing an epic plot twist that is sure to shake up the franchise in a major way.\nThe gameplay footage showcases Frank West, the protagonist from the original game, returning to Willamette, Colorado- the location of the first Dead Rising game- during the holiday season. As expected, a zombie outbreak ensues, and Frank is once again pitted against hordes of the undead.\nHowever, the leak also reveals a major twist- the zombies are no longer mindless drones. They are now able to use weapons, communicate with each other, and even organize themselves into factions. This raises the stakes significantly, as players must now be prepared to face a much more formidable enemy.\nBut that’s not all! The gameplay leak also suggests that the game will feature new and improved weapons such as an electrified axe and a crafting system that allows players to create unique and deadly combinations.\nIt’s clear that Dead Rising 4 is set to up the ante in a big way. The addition of intelligent zombies adds a new layer of complexity to the gameplay, forcing players to constantly adapt and evolve their strategies. With the promise of new weapons and crafting systems, the game is poised to be an even more immersive experience than its predecessors.\nOf course, fans of the series will undoubtedly have questions about the plot twist and how it will impact the overall story. Will the zombies become a more dominant presence in the game’s world, or will they remain a minor threat? What will happen to the existing characters as they navigate this new world order?\nAs of now, these questions remain unanswered, but one thing is for sure- Dead Rising 4 is shaping up to be an epic addition to the franchise. With its blend of action, horror, and humor, the game is sure to be a hit with fans of the series and newcomers alike.\nSo, are you ready for the zombie apocalypse? Dead Rising 4 is coming, and it’s going to be a thrilling ride. Get your weapons ready and keep your wits about you, because this time, the zombies are fighting back.\nDead Rising 3 could finally have a sequel, three years after its official release. Dead Rising 4 will most likely feature the same background as its predecessor and will improve the original game with cooperative multiplayer and other interesting online features.\nCPU, RAM and Network limiter with hot tab killer Integrated with Twitch, Discord, Instagram, Twitter and Messengers directly Built-in sound controls and custom music Custom color themes by Razer Chroma and force dark pages Free VPN and Ad blocker Download Opera GX The game’s developer has yet to confirm its intention of creating a sequel for this popular zombie-killing game, but recently leaked gameplay images and promotional material suggest that Dead Rising 4 is in the works. The source of these materials also suggests that the sequel will actually be a remake starring Frank West, the original protagonist of the series.\nThe same source also goes as far as implying that Dead Rising 4 will actually be announced at E3 and claims that the game will be available only on the Xbox One and Windows 10. It appears that Microsoft is funding the sequel, therefore the company wants to make sure as many users as possible have access to the game.\nAs far as the game action is concerned, rumors also suggest that players can team up in units of four, working together to smash as many zombie heads as possible.\nIf you’re into this kind of games, check out Judge Dredd vs. Zombies, a free mobile shooter with very intense gameplay. After a few levels, you will have hordes of zombies coming at you from every direction. This aspect is more visible in the Arena gameplay where you have a great number of zombies and not much time to kill them all.\nIf you want to take fear to the next level, we suggest you try Agony, a horror game that will be released this year. You’ll play the role of an amnesiac spirit who tries to escape from Hell. While you have no memory about your past besides your fall to Hell, what you know for sure is that you don’t want to be in that horrific place. Of course, you’ll have to kill many demons to get out.\nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:\nXbox One Slim to be announced at E3 2016?\nWatch Dogs 2 release date leaked online, watch the announcement here\nTitanfall 2 gameplay details leaked revealing new tactical plays and bigger multiplayer maps\nRed Dead Redemption sequel leaked map reveals game details\nDead Rising 4windows games\nEmail *\nCommenting as .
