Title: Warning: MacBook Pro Owners Beware - Lineamental Process is Devouring Your CPU and Here's How to Fix It!

Are you experiencing slow performance and overheating issues on your MacBook Pro? The culprit might be a process called Lineamental and it's known to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources, which can lead to catastrophic consequences. In this post, we explore the Lineamental process, its impact on your MacBook Pro performance, and how to fix it.

What is the Lineamental Process?

Simply put, Lineamental is a process that runs in the background on your MacBook Pro. It's a part of the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client software, which helps in establishing a secure network connection for remote workers. Its purpose is to ensure the security of the online communication channel, but it can have a significant impact on your computer's performance.

How Does Lineamental Impact Your MacBook Pro Performance?

The Lineamental process consumes an enormous amount of CPU resources, which can slow down your MacBook Pro's performance. It can also cause overheating issues that can ultimately damage your device's hardware. Once the process starts, it continues to consume high CPU usage, even when you're not connected to a VPN network. This means that you'll likely notice slower performance, reduced battery life, and reduced overall usability of your MacBook Pro.

How to Fix the Lineamental Process

Thankfully, there are several ways to fix the Lineamental process, including:

1. Disable AnyConnect VPN Client Software - If you're experiencing slow performance and overheating issues, it's best to disable the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client software. To do this, go to the Applications folder and locate the AnyConnect client app. From there, right-click on the app and select "Move to Trash."

2. Uninstall AnyConnect VPN Client Software - If you don't need the AnyConnect VPN client software, it's best to uninstall it completely. To do this, go to the Applications folder and locate the AnyConnect client app. From there, drag the app to the trash and empty the trash.

3. Kill the Lineamental Process - If you're unable to disable or uninstall AnyConnect, you can kill the Lineamental process manually using the Activity Monitor app. To do this, open the Activity Monitor app by searching it in Spotlight. From there, locate the Lineamental process and click the "X" button in the upper left corner to force quit the process.

Conclusion

The Lineamental process can have a significant impact on your MacBook Pro's performance, especially in terms of slower performance, reduced battery life, and overheating issues. By disabling, uninstalling or killing the process, you can dramatically improve your MacBook Pro's performance and avoid hardware damage. If you're still experiencing issues, you might want to consider contacting Apple support or consulting a professional for further assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi. I have had a problem with the macbook overheating for several days. I installed iStat which showed me that the system process which is called “lineamental “consumes all CPU resources. It is interesting that when I activate the activity monitor, this process automatically closes and the problem disappears. I did a virus scan with a bitdefender scanner and found nothing. Help

 Well, that’s a new one!
Using a different Mac system create a bootable external drive of the same macOS your Mac is using. Using it see if your system still boots up cleanly (use the Option (⌥) key to using your external drive). If it does you’ll need to slowly install your apps afresh to the external drive. One of the apps you installed is the likely culprit.
