Title: Streaming at a Snail's Pace? 5 Genius Tricks to Turbo-Charge Your Viewing Experience!

Streaming videos online is one of the most popular pastimes for people from all walks of life. However, nothing can be more frustrating than trying to watch your favorite show or movie only to be stopped in your tracks by poor streaming speeds. That's where these five genius tricks come in to help you turbo-charge your viewing experience and get you back to enjoying your programs in no time!

1. Check Your Internet Speeds Before you even start streaming, it's important to check your internet speeds to ensure that they can handle the demands of video playback. A good speed test will let you know how the connection to your home, office or mobile network is performing. If the speeds are too slow, upgrading your internet plan might be a worthy investment to ensure you're never waiting for that spinning wheel again.

2. Use Ethernet Cables Instead of Wi-Fi Wi-Fi is convenient, but it can't match the reliability and speed of a wired Ethernet connection. Ethernet cables are faster and provide a more stable connection, making them ideal for streaming videos online. Make sure your modem or router allow Ethernet cables and you can purchase one at any computer store for a reasonable cost.

3. Close Unused Tabs and Apps Streaming videos uses a lot of data, and unused tabs and apps can eat up more bandwidth than you'd expect. By closing out tabs and apps on your devices that are not necessary for streaming, you can even out the load and free up speed.

4. Upgrade Your Hardware Streaming videos can be hard on your devices, especially if they're already outdated. Upgrading to the latest version of software or hardware can boost your streaming speeds and eliminate compatibility issues.

5. Use a VPN Service Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can sometimes throttle streaming speeds, meaning your connection is slowed down when you're using heavy bandwidth like streaming. Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help to tackle this. VPN services work by establishing a private connection between your streaming device and a secure server in another location, bypassing your ISP's restrictions and enabling you to stream without interruption.

Streaming videos online doesn't have to be a frustrating experience. By utilizing these five genius tricks, you can turbo-charge your viewing experience and enjoy your favorite programs. Remember to always check your internet speeds, use Ethernet cables, close unnecessary tabs and apps, upgrade your hardware, and use a VPN service to improve your streaming speeds. Now go forth and enjoy your shows!

When we’re enjoying watching our favorite content online, there’s nothing more annoying than experiencing slow buffering. As soon as the video quality drops, we snap (story of every cinephile ever). Struggling with streaming issues is nothing but a hindrance, which we don’t wish to deal with, right? We surely cannot live without online streaming services, so here are some most common streaming issues along with their quick fixes that will allow you deal with all streaming related troubles and make the most of your entertainment sessions.
 
Let’s get started.
 
## How to Deal with Slow Streaming Issues
 
### Reset Device
 
Yes, the same old trick that has saved us every time, the moment anything goes wrong. If you’re experiencing any kind of buffering issues, while streaming online, pause the content and exit the app, and then restart the device (Television, smartphone or laptop) on which you were viewing.
 
Also, as an added measure, you can also try resetting your home’s Wi-Fi network to see, if it improves the streaming quality.
 
### Check Internet Speed
 
 If you’re viewing content on a mobile device or laptop, then you can start off by checking the current Internet speed on your network connection. Head on to Google, type speed test and hit enter. Pick any website to check your network’s speed to assess, if there’s an issue with the Wi-Fi or mobile data pack. To stream in high quality, you require a minimum speed of approx. 15 MB per second for buffering HD content.
 
### Limit the Number of Connected Devices
 
Almost all of our gadgets and appliances are connected to our home’s Wi-Fi network, right? You may not realize it, but roughly 7-8 devices are always connected to your Wi-Fi, be it all your family member’s phone, smart TV, coffee maker, video doorbell and more. So, in a situation like this, it can give rise to a possibility that your smart TV or phone or any device on which you’re viewing content might not get enough bandwidth from the Internet connection. To avoid this, you can try disconnecting all other devices from your Wi-Fi, and only connect one device at a time to check if it solves the slow buffering issue.
 
### Switch the Video Quality
 

 
No matter which streaming service you use, it always offers an option to pick the streaming speed which includes: High, Medium and Low. So, next time, whenever you’re facing slow streaming or buffering issues, try switching the speed and change the current setting. If you’re streaming in high quality then switch to low, let the playback run for a while and then again revert back to the original setting. This is a useful hack that can considerably improve the streaming quality of your content.
 
### Try a Different Streaming Service
 
 If the above-mentioned steps didn’t work out too well for you, then there may be some server related issues from the streaming service’s end. You can either contact their support team to get the issue fixed or switch to an alternative streaming service in the meanwhile.
