Revamp your Boat's Waterski Compartment with these Ingenious Floor Cover Hacks!

Are you tired of the outdated and dull waterski compartment in your boat? Well, it's time to give it a fancy and sleek water-resistant floor cover that is perfect for your waterski compartment. Not only you will improve the aesthetic appeal of your boat, but you will also protect your equipment and improve your experience while skiing. 

You don't have to break your bank to achieve this revamp goal; here are some ingenious floor cover hacks that you can use to give your boat's waterski compartment a complete transformation.

1. Use Rubber Mats

One of the most popular waterski compartment floor cover options is using rubber mats. These mats are natural water-resistant, easy to clean, and durable, making them perfect for waterski compartments. They are also affordable and come in various sizes and colors to fit your boat's compartment.

To install the rubber mats, cut them to the exact shape of your compartment floor using a sharp blade, and use adhesive glue to stick them to the surface.

2. Go for Linoleum Sheets

Linoleum sheets are another affordable and excellent waterski compartment floor cover option. They are durable and water-resistant, and they come in various colors and designs to enable you to match them with your boat's overall look. Linoleum sheets are also easy to install and maintain, making them perfect for boat lovers.

To install them, clean your compartment floor with a suitable detergent and let it dry completely. Then, cut the linoleum sheet to fit the compartment's shape and size, lay it on the floor, and use adhesive glue to seal it in place.

3. Get Creative with Plastic

If you're looking for a more affordable waterski compartment floor cover hack, then using plastic might be your go-to option. You can buy a big plastic sheet, cut it to your compartment's size and shape, and seal it in place using adhesive glue. However, plastic sheets can be slippery, so it's essential to ensure that they have a gritty texture to enable you to step on them without sliding.

4. Use Marine Carpet

Marine carpets are specially designed to withstand water, mildew, and UV rays, making them perfect for waterski compartments. They come in various colors and designs, and their thick and cushioned nature makes them comfortable to step on. To install them, cut them to fit your compartment's size and shape, lay them on the floor, and use adhesive glue to seal them in place.

In conclusion, revamping your boat's waterski compartment with these ingenious floor cover hacks is a fantastic way to give your boat a new look and enhance your skiing experience. Whether you choose to use rubber mats, linoleum sheets, plastic, or marine carpet, ensure that you consider durability, water resistance, and comfortability when selecting the best option. Simple hacks like these can give your boat a fresh start for the summer season!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi Folks
I'm trying to fix a floor cover for a water ski compartment in the floor of my boat. Unfortunately its proving challenging to get the part replaced via the manufacturer, so I'm trying to see what solution I can come up with.
I've looked into plastic injection moulding as an option to replace it, but its rather expensive. For now my preference would be to see how could I fix the cover itself and ensure its still aesthetically pleasing. The cover itself runs along the floor of the boat in the centre and stores water skis, so its a highly trafficked area of the boat
If its not clear via the photos its got a few cracks in the middle of it. I'm not sure if super glue will be able to hold this area and amount of usage.
dimensions are aprox 33cm x 97cm x 4cm
Looking forward to your ideas please
Thanks

 @twalis you know deep down there that superglue is definitely not a viable option. Go all out and go fancy. Get some Epoxy resin with some awesome stains and pour it, using your current plastic part as the base. Tons of Youtube video showing you what can be done with epoxy resin.
