# Is Your MacBook Air Hinge Damaged? Shocking Reason Why Lines Appear on Screen When Opened Revealed!

If you're a MacBook Air user and have been experiencing problems with the screen display, such as lines or distortion when the laptop is opened, then you may have a damaged hinge.

This issue has been reported by many MacBook Air users, and the cause of it may surprise you. According to Apple, the issue arises due to the hinge being damaged. This damage may occur over time due to frequent use or accidental drops.

The hinge is an essential component of the MacBook Air, as it connects the display with the keyboard and houses the cables that transmit the video signal from the logic board to the screen. A damaged hinge can cause the cables to fray or become disconnected, leading to the appearance of lines on the screen.

If you suspect that your MacBook Air hinge is damaged, there are a few things you can do to check. First, try gently moving the screen up and down to see if there is excessive play or if the screen wobbles. Second, close the laptop and inspect the hinge for any visible damage or cracks.

If you detect any issues with the hinge, it's important to address them promptly. Ignoring the issue can lead to further damage to the MacBook Air, which can be costly to repair or even irreparable.

To prevent damage to the MacBook Air hinge, always handle your laptop with care, only open the screen by the center, and avoid dropping the laptop or applying excessive force when closing or opening it.

In conclusion, a damaged hinge can cause lines on the screen of your MacBook Air, so it's essential to keep an eye on its condition and promptly address any issues. Remember to always treat your laptop with care to avoid preventable damages.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a MacBook Air that shows distorted vertical lines and blocks on the screen when the hinge is opened and closed. I suspect that the screen cable may be bad since it only happens when opening the lid, and not when pressing around the LCD. Can anybody else give me some knowledge on this? Thanks in advance.

 Your display is damaged not the cable!
What is happening is the tension you are applying to the lid when you open it or close it causes the fine metal oxide deposits which are the wires that make your LCD work on the glass to break apart and then re-connect.
Similar to how a piece if torn paper which have a bunch of lines drawn across can be joined together so they appear as they once were before the page was ripped.
What likely happened is something heavy pressed on the lid or you gave the system a good bang.
