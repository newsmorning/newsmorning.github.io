At first glance, the new firmware update may not seem like much. It's a simple program that runs in the background and optimizes your laptop's power consumption based on your usage patterns. But don't be fooled by its humble appearance – this update packs a powerful punch that can extend your battery life by up to 25%.

So how does it work? The Dell XPS 13 S firmware update uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms to analyze your usage habits and adjust power settings accordingly. It takes into account factors like screen brightness, CPU usage, and background processes to ensure that your laptop is using only the resources it needs to get the job done. This means less wasted energy and more time between charges.

But that's not all. The new firmware update also includes a number of other features designed to maximize your battery life. For example, you can now set custom power profiles based on your specific needs – whether you're editing videos, browsing the web, or working on a presentation. You can also see detailed information about how your battery is being used, so you can make informed decisions about when to charge and when to conserve power.

Perhaps most impressively, the Dell XPS 13 S firmware update even includes a feature called "Adaptive Charging" that can actually extend the life of your laptop's battery over time. This feature monitors how you use your laptop and adapts its charging patterns to maintain the health of your battery. It can even learn from your habits over time to optimize its settings for maximum longevity.

Overall, the Dell XPS 13 S firmware update is a game changer for anyone who relies on their laptop for work or play.

Reviewers and laptop fans are impressed with the Dell XPS 13, which has a beautiful 11-inch aluminum frame that surrounds its edge-to-edge 13-inch Infinity Display. The bezel is only 5.2-inches thin and the laptop weighs in at only 1224 grams, coming in at a super slim 9-15mm. This is an ultrabook that already offers above average battery life and thanks to its latest firmware update, the XPS 9360’s battery received a 14% boost.
 
The Dell XPS 13 9360 is sold for $1,150 and ships with Windows 10 Home. Its LCD touchscreen has a resolution of 13.3-inches and supports a Full HD pixels resolution while its pixel ratio is 16:9. The device might not have the best webcam, but its stereo speakers get pretty loud and the typing experience is comfortable.
 
A month ago, Dell added the latest 7th-generation Intel Core CPUs (Kaby Lake) with pricing starting at $799. The base model comes with an Intel Core i5-7200U processor (with a score of 7,159 points on Geekbench 3) that’s backed by 8GB of RAM and houses a 256GB hard drive, while the other model uses a 3200 x 1800 pixels touchscreen and is powered by an Intel Core i7-7500U processor (which scored 7,915).
 
The latest BIOS update that was issued for the 9360 devices added a 14% boost in battery life, which is noticeable when watching a video with Netflix or playing videos using Windows 10’s Movie & TV app. This was achieved by offloading the device’s audio processing from the processor to a digital signal processor. The BIOS update has also fixed a Thunderbolt dock, the USB “Safe Remove” prompts, boot looping and hibernation issues.
 
Owners of the XPS 9360 can find the BIOS update, as well as other updated drivers, on Dell’s official website.
