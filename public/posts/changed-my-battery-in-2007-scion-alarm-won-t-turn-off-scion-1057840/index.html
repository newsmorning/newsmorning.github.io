Unfortunately, a man recently experienced an unexpected and frustrating issue while replacing the battery in his Scion. As he tried to start the car, the alarm went off and would not turn off, sending him into a frenzy.\nBody:\nThe man, whose name is not disclosed, had recently purchased a new battery for his Scion, which was due for replacement. After removing the old battery and installing the new one, he tried to start the car. However, he quickly realized that the alarm system had been triggered and would not shut off despite several attempts.\nHe contacted the dealership where he had purchased the car and explained the situation, but they were unable to offer a solution. He then sought help from a local car mechanic, who suggested that the alarm system might need to be reset.\nThe man followed the mechanic’s instructions and tried to reset the alarm system, but it still wouldn’t turn off. Frustrated, he started searching online for advice and came across a forum where others had faced similar issues with their Scion alarms.\nHe learned that some Scion models have a feature that activates the alarm when the battery is replaced, as a security measure. The alarm can only be reset with a specific procedure that involves pressing a combination of buttons in a specific sequence.\nThe man tried the button combination, and to his relief, the alarm finally turned off. However, he was surprised to find that other features of his Scion, such as the radio and clock, had been reset and needed to be reconfigured.\nHe later discovered that the Scion’s manual had instructions on how to reset the alarm after changing the battery, but he had not read it thoroughly. He advises others to take the time to read the manual thoroughly to avoid similar mishaps.\nConclusion:\nChanging a car’s battery is a simple task that can sometimes cause unexpected issues. If you own a Scion, make sure to read the manual and follow the instructions carefully to reset the alarm system after replacing the battery. Not doing so can cause the alarm to go into a frenzy that can be frustrating and time-consuming to disable.\nChosen Solution So drive the car to work battery was shot bought a new one changed it when I hooked up new battery alarm went crazy tried to turn off with key fob won’t turn off put key in to start car no power no lights only thing works is alarm and headlights worked fine before I swapped out battery it’s like it’s stuck in theft mode or something any help would be great thank u once again it’s a 2007 Scion tC\nthis usually happens when the security guard was active when the previous battery was removed or drained. now the car security program think someone is tempering with that car battery to get in. it’s probably stuck in a loop or just stuck on the actually wheels try pressing the horn for couple of times if that didn’t work open the bonnet and look for the fuse box and try to located a fuse named horn remove it and place it back that should shut the horn down and reset it if you don’t know where your fuse box it check your physical manual or online and if you still can’t find the fuse box . look towards the AC fan in front the horns should be around there be careful with your hands try cutting one of the horn wire it can be easily re-attached if you can’t seem to do that look for where the cable linked back and should almost be parallel to each other at some point because they’re circuit from same section. now try wrapping them together with a tape or something they should stop after touching each other hope this help cheers\nI know it’s a long shot getting a response but how did you get it out of theft mode?\nI have the same problem. 2006 scion tc .
