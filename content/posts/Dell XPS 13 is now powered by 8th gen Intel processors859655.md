XPS 13 and other Dell laptops are getting the 8th gen Kaby Lake chips, Intel’s newest CPUs.
 
### XPS 13 receives two of Intel’s quad-core chips
 
The first option is the i5 which runs at 1.6GHz featuring speeds up to 3.4GHz and the second option is the i7 which runs at 1.8GHz featuring speeds up to 4GHz.
 
Regarding the pricing and availability, you should know that Dells plans on phasing in the Core i7 chip on September 12th, and the i5 chip will come in October. There’s no pricing info available just yet for the XPS 13 models with the 8th gen CPUs, but the i7 is now being sold for $1,349.99, so they’ll probably be priced somewhere around this amount.
 
### The XPS 13 got fierce competition
 
XPS 13 will not get any more changes other than the new CPU options. This laptop featured one of the most impressive designs back in 2015 when it came out, but now there’s some fierce competition on the market. This happens as a result of the fact that more PC manufacturers have figured out how to make their own devices with smaller bezels.
 
### Lower-end Inspiron line gets CPU upgrades as well
 
Dell is also upgrading several laptops from the lower-end Inspiron line with the 8th generation CPUs. The 13 and 15-inches models of the Inspiron 5000 2-in-1 (this one is also getting an option for an active stylus), the Inspiron 7000 2-in-1, the 17-inch Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 and the standard Inspiron 7000 get the new CPUs as well. The Inspiron 7000 will also be getting a really nice and catchy rose gold option, but it will not be available in the States.
 
The 8th gen latest Intel chips replace the 7th gen options featured by these laptops; therefore, they will maintain their starting prices between $799 and $949. All the upgrades will become available starting October 3rd.
