Is Your Hairdo Ruined? Here's Why You NEED to Fix Your Curling Iron ASAP!

There's nothing more frustrating than having your hair finally styled to perfection, only for it to fall flat or frizz out within a few hours. Unfortunately, many people blame their hair when their curling iron is actually to blame!

If you're experiencing a failed hairdo due to your curling iron, it's time to take action to fix it. Here's why:

1. Damaged Hair

Using a curling iron that has dirty, worn, or damaged plates can cause serious harm to your hair. The heat from the iron can cause burns, breakage, or severe damage to the hair follicles. This can lead to split ends, dullness, or even hair loss.

2. Curling Irons with Temperature Control

Not all curling irons are created equal, and many models do not feature temperature control. Using an iron with a temperature setting that is too high for your hair type can quickly scorch or damage your locks.

3. Proper Use of Curling Irons

Many people use their curling irons in a way that is not safe or effective. They may leave the iron on the hair for too long, or use it at the wrong angle, leading to uneven or fried hair.

4. Using Heat Protectant Spray

If you're using a curling iron without a heat protectant spray, you are doing damage to your hair. Heat protectant spray acts as a barrier between the heat of the iron and your hair, reducing the risk of damage.

5. Hairbrush Maintenance

Your hairbrush can also impact your hairdo. If your brush is dirty or clogged with hair, it can transfer oil, dirt, and bacteria to your hair while you're styling it, causing it to become dirty and greasy.

So, how do you fix your curling iron to save your hairdo? Start by ensuring you are using a curling iron with temperature control and using heat protectant spray. Also, regularly clean your iron and replace its plates as necessary.

Practice proper curling iron technique and angle the iron correctly. This means using the right amount of pressure and heat for your hair type, and not leaving it on for too long.

Finally, make sure you take care of your hairbrush, cleaning it regularly and replacing it when necessary. By following these simple steps, you can enjoy a healthier, more beautiful hairdo every time!

 if i needed someone to work o my curling iron  can i send it in to you to fix it for a charged fee?

 Hi @maryde ,
ifixit does not do repairs.
Its’ volunteers offer advice on how to fix it yourself or what to do if you can’t.
What is the make and model number of the curling iron?
What is the problem with it?
Generally to fix electrical appliances you need a DMM (digital multimeter) and some appropriate tools e.g. soldering iron, sidecutters, screwdrivers etc to diagnose and fix the problem.
If you have none of them and unless you know someone who is interested in repairing electrical devices, then it may be better to contact a reputable professional electronics repair service or even a computer  or mobile phone repair service for a quote as they should have the tools and expertise to do the repair.
Just so that you are aware, sometimes with some electrical appliances, if a part is faulty or broken it may not be able to be repaired as the manufacturer doesn’t supply parts. They only wish to sell product. This is not to say that this is the case with your curling iron just so you know it is a possibility.
