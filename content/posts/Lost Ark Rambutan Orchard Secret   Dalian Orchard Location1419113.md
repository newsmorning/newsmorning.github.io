Step One: Find the Clue to the Orchard.

The first step to uncovering the rare Rambutan Orchard is to find the clue that leads to it. The clue is not an easy one to find, but it is essential for discovering the hidden gem.

To find the clue, players need to enter the City of Yu, located in the East of the continent. The city is a bustling metropolis full of traders, craftsmen, and adventurers. Players will need to talk to a trader named Zhang Ti in one of the markets located in the city.

Step Two: Look for the Hidden Path in the Mountains

With the clue in hand, players need to venture into the mountains. The path is hidden, and players will need to use their wits and intuition to find it.

As players travel through the dense forest and high mountains, they will eventually come across a hidden cliff path. Following this path will lead them to a majestic waterfall that cascades down into a cove. The hidden path to the Rambutan Orchard is hidden behind the waterfall.

Step Three: Explore the Rambutan Orchard

Once players have discovered the hidden path, they will arrive at the Rambutan Orchard, a hidden gem of Lost Ark. The Orchard is a beautiful and serene location filled with unique wildlife and vegetation.

The Rambutan fruit is a delicious tropical fruit that is rare to find in the mainland. The Orchard is the only place in the game where players can obtain these fruits.

Players can use the Rambutan fruit to create potions, or they can sell them for a high price in the market. Apart from the fruit, the Orchard is also home to unique creatures and rare herbs that players can use to enhance their gameplay.
