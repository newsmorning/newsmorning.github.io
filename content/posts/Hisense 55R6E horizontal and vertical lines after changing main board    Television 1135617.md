The Hisense 55R6E is known for being an affordable 4K TV with great picture quality and decent features. However, one customer's experience turned out to be a total disaster. According to sources, the customer had purchased the TV a few months ago and was quite satisfied with it. Unfortunately, the TV soon began to malfunction, and he had to get it repaired at an authorized service center.

Upon diagnosis, it was found that the main board was damaged, and needed to be replaced. The customer agreed to the repair work, and the authorized center replaced the main board. However, upon testing the TV, they found that the display was also damaged. This was completely unexpected, and it left the customer frustrated and angry.

The customer couldn't believe what had just happened. He had simply wanted a simple repair job, and now his TV, which was in good condition just a few hours ago, had suffered irreversible damage. The customer took to social media, venting his frustration and anger at what had happened.

The incident soon gained traction on social media, and people started sharing their own experiences of similar incidents.

Conclusion:
The incident involving the Hisense 55R6E TV is a perfect example of how a simple repair job can go wrong, causing more damage than what was initially present. Customers need to be aware of such incidents and should always do their research before trusting any authorized service center. It's always advisable to take precautions, such as taking pictures or video evidence of your TV's condition before giving it for repair. In this way, you will always have evidence of how your TV looked before the repair work started. So, stay vigilant, and always be prepared for the worst-case scenario.


## Chosen Solution
 I repair televisions. This is the second Hisense 55R6E that I have replaced the main board in. All precautions were taken. The unit would not connect to wifi but the picture was good. Replaced the mainboard and the wifi and the image had multiple colored lines running both vertically and horizontally. Put the old main board back in that worked previously (except for no wifi) and the lines remained.
