The good news is that you don't have to buy a new computer. A simple upgrade hack can help you boost the performance of your Late 2013 iMac - add a SATA HDD.

What is a SATA HDD?

SATA HDD (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment Hard Disk Drive) is a type of disk drive that stores and retrieves digital data using a series of spinning disks.

The Late 2013 iMac comes with a fusion drive that combines a traditional hard drive with solid-state storage. While fusion drives are faster than traditional hard drives, they can still slow down over time. By adding a SATA HDD to your iMac, you can increase the storage space, speed up data transfer rates, and improve overall performance.

## Chosen Solution
 iMac Intel 27" late 2013
OK, having search through most of the questions it seems that users would most often like to upgrade their hard drive to a solid-state drive using the standard SATA connector.
I've read that system with factory installed SSDs have the require PCI-e slot, but if originally equipped with a HHD, the logic board doesn't have that port available.
In my case, I have a late 2013 27" iMac with the PCI-e SSD, but want to add an internal HDD. Did Apple build this logic board with a SATA port for that? I would assume the SSD only and Fushion drive iMacs used the same board, which means it should, but I was looking for someone with a bit of experience with this chassis to confirm it before I begin dissembling it.
Lastly, if so, will this unit require the same temperature adapter as earlier iMac's when using non-Apple sources HDDs?
Thanks so much!
