EXPOSED: Lost Ark's In-Game Shop CRASHES! Find out the QUICK FIX here!

Are you a fan of Lost Ark, the MMORPG sensation that took the gaming world by storm? Do you often spend hours exploring the game's vast world, hacking and slashing your way to glory? If yes, then you are probably familiar with the game's in-game shop, which allows players to purchase various items and boosts to enhance their gameplay experience. However, what happens when this shop crashes, leaving players frustrated and helpless? Well, it seems like Lost Ark's in-game shop has been facing some issues lately, with players reporting crashes and error messages while trying to make purchases. In this article, we will explore the causes of this problem and suggest some quick fixes that can help you get back into the game.

The Cause

Before we delve into the solutions, let's first understand the cause of this problem. As per reports, Lost Ark's in-game shop crashes occur due to server overload. With increasing numbers of players joining the game daily, the server can get overwhelmed, leading to slow response times and crashes. Another reason for the crashes could be a bug in the game's code that is causing the shop to malfunction.

The Solutions

Now that we know what's causing the problem let's look at some quick fixes that can help you get back into the game. These fixes are easy to understand and can be implemented quickly.

1. Restart the Game

The easiest and quickest solution is to restart the game. Sometimes, the shop crashes may be due to a temporary glitch, and restarting the game will solve the problem.

2. Check Your Internet Connection

Sometimes, unstable internet connections can cause the shop to crash. Check your internet connection and make sure that it is stable. If your internet connection is down, try restarting your modem or router.

3. Clear Cache and Cookies

Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can also help solve the problem. The cache and cookies can accumulate over time, leading to a slow response time from the server, which may cause the shop to crash.

4. Wait for a While

With so many players joining the game, the server can get overloaded leading to slow response times and crashes. It's not uncommon for the shop to crash during peak hours. If you are facing the same problem, wait for a while, and try again later.

5. Report the Issue

If the problem persists, report the issue to the game's support team. They will be able to investigate the issue and provide you with a solution.

Conclusion

Lost Ark's in-game shop crashes can be frustrating, but they can be easily resolved with some quick fixes. By restarting the game, checking your internet connection, clearing cache and cookies, waiting for a while, or reporting the issue, you can get back to the game in no time. Don't let these occasional hiccups ruin your gaming experience. Use these tips to solve the problem and continue to explore the vast world of Lost Ark.

The in-game Store in Lost Ark offers various items that you can purchase (even with real-world currency via the Steam wallet). So, if you are planning to buy a certain product but Lost Ark shop is not working at that moment, it can be a bit annoying.
 
## How to Fix Lost Ark Shop Not Working Issue?
 

 
If you want to buy some Shards, Fragments, Mounts, or more Essential in-game items in the Lost Ark Shop but are unable to connect to it or load it up, here’s what you need to do:
 
### Check if Lost Ark Servers are Down
 
Here’s how to check if Lost Ark servers are down due to an outage/server overload or maintenance period. In such a scenario, there is nothing you can do from your end. Wait until the server issues are resolved by the developers and then you can jump back into the game and check out the in-game shop.
 
### Check your Internet Connection
 
This is the obvious thing to check – but worth doing every time you face a connection error. Reset your router and load up the game to see if you are able to access the shop again.
 
### Restart the Game
 
In case a bug has appeared while you were playing the game for a long time, make sure to close Lost Ark and reload it. Check if the Shop is working now.
 
### Verify Steam Game Files
 
- Open the Steam client.
 - Find Lost Ark in the Library.
 - Right-click on the name and click on Properties.
 - On the left side, there’s a Local Files tab that you need to click on.
 - Click on Verify Integrity of Game Files.
 - After the verification process is over, start the game again and see if it still crashes midway or at startup

 
### Update the Game to the Latest Patch
 
The devs of Lost Ark are quick to fix issues and release patches that address issues related to currency exchange, bugs, and yes, even the Shop. You can check out the official Forum to see if they have responded to a player query regarding the same. For example, here’s a comment by a moderator.
 
So, if you see an error message that says “Shop response is slow. Please try again later” know that it’s something that only the developers can fix.
