This means that your pins will only be visible to your followers, and you will have to approve every new follower request. To do this, go to your profile, click on the three dots in the top-right corner, select “settings,” and toggle the “Privacy” switch to “on.”\nTurn Off Search Engines Pinterest allows search engines like Google to index boards and pins, which means that they can show up in search results.

To do this, navigate to their profile, click on the three dots in the top-right corner, and select “Block.”\nHide Your Boards If you have certain boards that you don’t want your followers to see, you can hide them. To do this, go to your profile, click on the board you want to hide, click on the three dots in the top-right corner, and select “Edit.” Then, scroll down to “Who can see this board?” and select “Just me.”\nHide Your Likes If you don’t want your likes to be visible to others, you can hide them. To do this, go to your profile, click on “Pins,” and then click on “Liked.” Then, click on the pencil icon in the top-right corner and toggle the “Show on profile” switch to “off.”\nDisable Email Notifications If you’re getting too many email notifications from Pinterest, you can disable them. To do this, go to your settings, click on “Notifications,” and toggle off any notifications that you don’t want to receive.\nDisconnect Social Media Accounts If you’ve connected your Pinterest account to your other social media accounts, you may be sharing more information than you realize. To disconnect your accounts, go to your settings, click on “Social Networks,” and click on “Disconnect” next to any accounts that you want to unlink.\nClear Browsing History Pinterest uses cookies to track your browsing history and personalize your experience. If you don’t want Pinterest to track you, you can clear your browsing history.

Not everyone wants their information out there.\nFortunately, Pinterest has a lot of tools at the disposal of its users that they can use to protect personal information or just want to keep things to themselves.\nBut there’s still one question you may have on your mind. Can Pinterest itself be trusted?\nInternet security is something on everyone’s mind and worries that their favorite site may be tracking them. Several websites have combated this, but the same can’t be said about Pinterest.\nCan we download videos from Pinterest? Pinterest doesn’t allow you to download videos by default. This is to prevent copyright infringement and distribution of other people’s content.\nBrowse the web from multiple devices with increased security protocols.\nAccess content across the globe at the highest speed rate.\nConnect to thousands of servers for persistent seamless browsing.\nHowever, if you just want to make a backup of a video, you can do it with many third-party services.

Yes, but only if you allow them to.
