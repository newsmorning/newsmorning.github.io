Title: Is Your LG RC9011B Dryer About to Quit? Discover Why It's Making a Strange Humming Noise!

Introduction: 

A dryer is an essential appliance in any household, especially during the cold and rainy seasons. The LG RC9011B Dryer is a popular choice among homeowners due to its advanced features and reliability. However, if your LG RC9011B Dryer has started making a strange humming noise, it could be an indication of a problem that needs immediate attention. In this article, we will discover the reasons behind the humming noise and how to fix them.

Body: 

1) Damaged Motor: One of the main reasons why your LG RC9011B Dryer is making a humming noise is due to a damaged motor. The motor is responsible for rotating the drum, and when it is damaged, it could cause an unusual sound. If you suspect a faulty motor, call a professional technician to inspect and repair or replace it.

2) Worn-out Belt: Another possible reason behind the strange humming noise from your LG Dryer is a worn-out belt. The belt connects the motor to the drum, and when it becomes loose, it may start to make a sound that resembles a low humming noise. This problem is relatively easy to fix, but doing it yourself may be challenging. Therefore, it is advisable to call a professional technician to fix or replace the belt.

3) Obstructed Fan: The fan is responsible for circulating hot air in the dryer, and when it is obstructed by lint or debris, it may start to make a strange humming noise. The good news is that this is a simple problem to fix. All you have to do is unplug the dryer, remove the lint screen, and clean any debris from the fan.

4) Loose or Damaged Parts: The humming noise could also be due to loose or damaged parts such as screws, bearings, or rollers. If left unchecked, these parts could cause more damage to your dryer. To fix this problem, call a professional technician to inspect the dryer and replace the damaged or loose parts.

Conclusion: 

A strange humming noise from your LG RC9011B Dryer is a sign of a problem that requires attention. The above-discussed issues could be the underlying causes of the noise, and it is essential to address them immediately to avoid more significant problems. Always call a professional technician to inspect and repair your dryer to ensure safety and maximize its lifespan.

## Chosen Solution
 I've tried repairing my dryer with no luck, so far I've replaced the drain pump and motor but still having same issue. The dryer will hum and slowly spin whilst turned off but plug switch turned on. When powering up it will continue to make the hum. I choose any program and it will spin up for approx 3 seconds before halting, creating a larger humming sound and spinning the drum backwards. I have tried to do a video as will make more sense. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated as would prefer to fix rather than send to landfill.

 Hi,
A humming motor usually indicates either a faulty motor start winding or perhaps the motor capacitor (supplier example only) may be faulty. It seems that the motor is trying to start on the run winding only and this doesn’t produce enough magnetism to start the motor rotating, therefore the hum.
The capacitor is there to increase the torque of the motor on startup if it is wired as a start capacitor or to improve the efficiency of the motor if it is wired as a run capacitor. I don’t know which it is in your dryer.
The current flowing through both windings ensure that there is sufficient magnetism produced to overcome the inertia of the motor from the at-rest position and once the motor is up to speed an internal centrifugal switch operates and disconnects the start winding from the circuit, allowing the motor to run on the run winding only.
Here’s a link to the section of the service manual that shows the resistance values of the motor windings and also the capacitor, which may help.

 The service manual is available (I looked). But I’d make sure I’ve got real 220 VAC on the power in. Humming motors are usually under excessive load or are under powered. Losing 1 leg of the 220 could easily be the issue.  Check the easy stuff first. Good Hunting <<<)))
