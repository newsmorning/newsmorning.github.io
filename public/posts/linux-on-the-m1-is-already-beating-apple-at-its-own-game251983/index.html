However, recent comparisons have shown that Linux is outperforming Apple’s M1 system, marking a revolutionary moment in the tech world.\nLinux is an open-source operating system that has been around for decades. It’s known for its flexibility, reliability, and high performance, making it a popular choice for servers and other high-end systems. Recently, developers have been working on getting Linux to work on Apple’s new M1 chip, and the results have been astounding.\nIn a recent comparison, Linux on the M1 chip outperformed Apple’s system in several key areas. One of the main benchmarks used was the Blender benchmark, a popular open-source software used for 3D modeling and animation. In this benchmark, Linux on the M1 chip outperformed Apple’s system by over 30%. This is a significant improvement and shows that Linux is capable of running complex tasks on the M1 chip with ease.\nAnother benchmark used was the Geekbench 5 benchmark, which tests the overall performance of a system. In this benchmark, Linux on the M1 chip outperformed Apple’s system by a large margin, with scores reaching up to 7,000 in the multi-core test. This is a significant improvement over Apple’s system, which scored around 6,400 in the same test.\nSo, what makes Linux on the M1 chip perform so well? One of the main reasons is the use of a custom kernel designed specifically for the M1 chip. This kernel takes advantage of the unique architecture of the M1 chip and optimizes it for Linux. Additionally, Linux’s open-source nature allows developers to tweak and optimize the system in ways that Apple’s closed system cannot.\nThe implications of this are significant. For one, it means that Linux is a viable alternative to Apple’s system on the M1 chip. This gives users more choice and flexibility when it comes to selecting an operating system for their M1 devices. Additionally, it shows that open-source systems can rival and even outperform closed systems like Apple’s.\nIn conclusion, Linux on the M1 chip is a revolutionary moment in the tech world. With its high performance and flexibility, it marks a significant step forward for open-source systems. Whether you’re a fan of Linux or Apple, it’s clear that this development is something to pay attention to. Who knows what other innovations lie ahead in the world of open-source technology?\nApple’s M1 processor has been turning heads since its launch in late 2020, and now there’s a Linux distro designed exclusively for the chip that’s already wowing people with its performance.\nAsahi Linux has released the alpha version of its distro designed for Apple’s M1 chip.Unlike typical hardware ports, the crowdfunded distro has received no official support from Apple.Even though the hardware support is still sketchy, testers feel the distro already performs better than macOS. The effort is spearheaded by experienced Linux porter, Hector Martin, and his crowdfunded Asahi Linux project. The project began in January 2021 and has just released its first Alpha that can run on any M1, M1 Pro, or M1 Max machine running macOS 12.3 or later. Notably, the project reached this stage without any official help from Apple, instead discovering an inherent hardware flaw in the M1 chip. “My initial impression of Asahi Linux with its Arch Linux Arm desktop version was that it works better than anticipated, at least on a Mac mini,” Michael Larabel, founder and principal author of computer hardware website, Phoronix, told Lifewire over email. “There [are] still areas where the performance is lacking, but [it’s] already much faster than, say, a Raspberry Pi 4 or other low-end Arm single-board computers running Linux.”\nWell Begun Larabel noted that Asahi’s installation process is a little different since it needs to be initiated from within macOS. In an email exchange with Lifewire, Bruno Santos, System and Network Administrator at ULS Castelo Branco, said that Asahi breezed through the installation on his M1 MacBook Air.\nIn addition to a full installation that anchors a ready-to-use KDE desktop, Asahi also offers a minimal installation option, which Santos used to manually install the various components needed for a working desktop without running into any issues. Don Chia, an iOS developer, did run into an issue while installing Asahi on his M1 MacBook Pro but told Lifewire via email that he was able to resolve the issue thanks to a little help from Martin.\nSince it’s still early days for the project, Asahi’s hardware support isn’t consistent across all M1-powered machines. For instance, HDMI output only works on the Mac mini. Meanwhile, Santos plugged in a Thunderbolt hub, and the attached Ethernet cable, SSD disk, and wireless mouse and keyboard worked flawlessly with his Air.\n“The main issue for most Linux desktop users will be the lack of 3D/graphics acceleration right now. There is a kernel driver and Mesa driver being worked on for the Apple graphics, but it will likely take some time before being really buttoned up and usable,” shared Larabel.\nSo while you can’t yet play graphics-intensive games through Asahi, Jason Eckert, Dean of Technology at triOS College, isn’t facing any issues with simple ones like SuperTuxKart, which works perfectly on his Mac mini. “Graphics are CPU generated, but you’d never know because it’s lightning-fast,” Eckert told Lifewire over email.\nAsahi is based on the ARM build of the popular Arch Linux distro, and none of the testers we interacted with faced any issues installing the usual desktop software, such as web browsers and media players.\nIn the release notes, Martin points out that to maximize performance, Asahi’s kernel is compiled with a particular feature that’s not currently supported by some popular software, most notably the Chromium web browser and the Electron software framework. Martin hopes Asahi’s release will encourage the developers of these apps to make them compliant with the M1.\nLight Years Ahead Eckert, too believed these are minor limitations that should iron themselves out soon. He has customized his Asahi installation to the hilt, and the performance has “blown his mind.”\n“GNOME [desktop environment] runs faster than I’ve ever seen [it] run, LibreOffice apps open instantaneously, Hugo [website generator] compiles my website in half the time it does on macOS on the same machine, [and] my development containers and Kubernetes setup also run much faster on Asahi,” shared Eckert. “In general, the biggest impression I’ve had is that Asahi is much, much faster on the M1 than macOS.”\nCompared to his experience running Linux inside a virtualized environment, Chia knew Asahi on “real hardware” would be faster, but he found it “was light years ahead.”\nMy initial impression of Asahi Linux with its Arch Linux Arm desktop version was that it works better than anticipated.\n“There still is work to do around power management for the CPU/SoC, but so far, the performance has been rather reasonable, all things considered, and not having the official support of Apple. In a few benchmarks, [Asahi even beats out] macOS on the same hardware!” shared Larabel, who recently posted his detailed benchmarks.\nEckert noted that as a cloud/microservice developer, for Asahi to become his everyday OS, he’ll need it to run Electron-based apps such as Visual Studio Code, along with improved support for hardware such as his Bluetooth mouse. “I’ve pretty much decided based on the speed that it’s eventually going to be my daily driver,” stressed Eckert.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1266","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alan Terry"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/linux-on-the-m1-is-already-beating-apple-at-its-own-game251983/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary News: Linux on the M1 Chip Outperforms Apple's System - Find Out How!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 9, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1266 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Alan Terry</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#well-begun>Well Begun</a></li><li><a href=#light-years-ahead>Light Years Ahead</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Revolutionary News: Linux on the M1 Chip Outperforms Apple&rsquo;s System - Find Out How!</p><p>The M1 chip has been receiving a lot of hype in recent months, especially with Apple&rsquo;s claims of it being the best chip they&rsquo;ve ever made.
