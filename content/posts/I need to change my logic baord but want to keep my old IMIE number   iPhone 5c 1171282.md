Shocking Solution to Keep Old Imie on Iphone 5C - You Won't Believe How!

The Imie number is a unique identifier for every mobile phone, and it is used to track stolen devices or to identify them when they are lost. However, some iPhone 5C users might want to keep their old Imie number, even after upgrading to a new device. This might sound like an impossible task, but it is actually quite simple. In this article, we will explore the shocking solution to keep your old Imie number on your iPhone 5C.

First and foremost, it is important to note that changing an Imie number is illegal in most countries. Therefore, it is crucial to use this solution only for personal use and not to engage in any illegal activities.

The solution involves using a technique called Imie cloning. In simple terms, Imie cloning involves copying the Imie number from one device to another. This technique is commonly used by fraudsters to activate stolen devices, but it can also be used by individuals to keep their old Imie on a new device.

The first step in Imie cloning is to find a device with the desired Imie number. This can be either a broken device or a device that is no longer in use. Once a device is found, the next step is to extract the Imie number.

The easiest way to extract the Imie number is by using a specialized tool called an Imie reader. This tool reads the Imie number directly from the device's hardware. Imie readers can be purchased online, and they are relatively affordable.

Once the Imie number is extracted, it can be copied onto the new iPhone 5C. This involves opening up the device and swapping out the old Imie number for the new one. This is a delicate process that requires some technical knowledge, so it is recommended to seek assistance from a professional if you are not comfortable with it.

It is important to note that Imie cloning has its risks. The process can potentially damage the device, and it can also lead to the device being blacklisted by the carrier. Therefore, it is crucial to proceed with caution and weigh the risks before attempting Imie cloning.

In conclusion, keeping your old Imie number on your iPhone 5C might seem like an impossible task, but with Imie cloning, it is possible. However, it is important to note that Imie cloning is illegal in most countries and should only be used for personal use. Additionally, Imie cloning requires technical knowledge and carries its risks, so it is recommended to seek assistance from a professional. With the right precautions, Imie cloning can be a shocking solution to keep your old Imie number on your iPhone 5C.


## Chosen Solution
 I have a logic board that is messed up in my iPhone 5C I am going to put a new logic board in my phone but I want the new logic board to have the same IMIE nuber as the one that is not working properly. How would I reprogram the new logicbaord with my IMIE nuber from the back of the phone??

 I honestly do not think there is a way. The imei is in the motherboard’s “mainframe” and cannot really be changed unfortunately.
