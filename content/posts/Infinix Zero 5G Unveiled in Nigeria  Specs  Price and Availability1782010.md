We are a month into the new year and as expected, new smartphone iterations are beginning to flood in. First, we saw Samsung with the unveiling of the Galaxy S22 series (Galaxy S22, S22+, and S22 Ultra) and the Galaxy Tab S8 series (Galaxy Tab S8, S8+, and S8 Ultra). 
 
Now, we have Infinix with the unveiling of the new Infinix Zero 5G – it has launched in Kenya and now, Nigeria. Now that two telecom operators (MTN and Mafab) have been granted 5G licenses in Nigeria, we expect to see more 5G smartphones in Nigeria this year. The Infinix Zero 5G has been unveiled in Nigeria and it is available in retail stores at a retail price of 169,500 nairas ($340). 
 
The Infinix Zero 5G features a massive 6.78-inch display with an FHD+(1080 x 2460 pixels) resolution. It is also surprising to see that the LCD display comes with a 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate. And a peak brightness of 500 nits. 
 
The display also includes a punch-hole that houses the front-facing camera – a single 16-megapixel selfie camera. On the rear of the Infinix Zero 5G, however, there is a triple camera set up: a 48-megapixel main sensor that comes with a 30X zoom capability, a 13-megapixel secondary sensor, and a 2MP sensor. To support this camera setup is a quad-LED flash and dual front flash. 
 
It is powered by the 6nm MediaTek Dimensity 900 chipset, supported by 8GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage, with a microSD card slot to expand your storage up to 256GB. There’s also the 5,000mAh battery that, according to Infinix, can offer up to 22 hours of Talktime and 27 days of standby. Furthermore, it comes with support for 33W fast charging technology.
