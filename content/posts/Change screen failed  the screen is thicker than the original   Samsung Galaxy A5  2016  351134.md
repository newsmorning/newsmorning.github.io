Title: Samsung Galaxy A5 2016 Upgrade Fail: Thicker Screen than the Original!

Samsung has been one of the world's leading brands when it comes to smartphones. In recent years, the Korean tech giant has released a number of high-quality devices that have revolutionized the smartphone industry. But it looks like the brand's latest release - the Galaxy A5 2016 upgrade - has failed its customers mightily.

Samsung has always been known for producing phones with sleek, slim designs. One of the defining features of the Galaxy A5 2016's predecessor was its slim profile, which made it easy to handle and felt great in our pockets. However, with the A5 2016 upgrade, Samsung has chosen to go a different route, and not for the better.

While the previous model had a 5.2-inch screen, the A5 2016 features a slightly larger 5.5-inch screen that was supposed to be better in every way. But the change in screen size is just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is how much thicker the new screen is compared to the original.

This is a jarring change for Samsung fans who are accustomed to the brand's slim designs. The added thickness makes the phone feel bulky and cumbersome to handle, affecting the overall user experience. And, needless to say, it's a major letdown for Samsung users who were expecting an upgrade that would improve on the flaws of the previous model.

A thicker screen also means that the phone's internal components, including the battery, have to be stacked differently. This can cause issues with heating and battery life, which are obviously significant concerns for any smartphone user.

It's unclear why Samsung made this decision. The brand is known for innovating and taking risks, but this departure from their established design principles seems to be a step too far. If anything, it seems to be a regression in design quality, rather than an improvement.

To be fair, the Galaxy A5 2016 still has a lot of great features. The phone's camera is impressive, and it runs on an octa-core processor that promises smooth performance. But for many smartphone users, design quality is just as important as technical specs. And with the A5 2016, Samsung seems to have missed the mark on this count.

In conclusion, Samsung has always been a brand that pushes boundaries and takes risks. But with the Galaxy A5 2016 upgrade, the company seems to have crossed a line. The added thickness of the phone's screen is a major disappointment for anyone who values sleek design and a slim profile. While there are still some great features to be found in the A5 2016, the design flaws are too significant for many users. Hopefully, Samsung will take note and make the necessary adjustments in their next release.

 There are a ton of these budget Samsung models. They may look very similar however parts for them differ slightly from model to model. You could have the wrong part. Could also be a low quality replacement since you got it from Ebay. I steer clear of these sites for parts since you never know what you are going to get.
