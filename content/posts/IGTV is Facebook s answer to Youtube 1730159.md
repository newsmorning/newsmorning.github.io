# Facebook's Revolutionary Move Will Change Online Video Forever - Introducing IGTV, The Ultimate YouTube Killer!

In the world of online videos, YouTube has been dominating the market for the past decade. However, competitors have been constantly trying to knock them off their pedestal. The most recent challenger is IGTV from Facebook, and it might be their best shot yet to become the ultimate YouTube killer.

IGTV is a standalone app from Instagram that allows users to upload and watch longer videos in a vertical format. This feature is a game-changer as most video platforms are predominantly horizontal, which is not optimized for mobile devices. By creating a vertical video experience, Facebook is catering to its core demographic, the younger generation, who primarily consume video content on their smartphones.

One of the standout features of IGTV is that it accepts videos up to 60 minutes in length. This is a stark difference from Instagram's existing 60-second video limit. This feature allows creators and publishers to upload longer content, which could potentially attract more viewers and advertisers.

In addition, IGTV's algorithm works similarly to Instagram's algorithm, creating a personalized experience for users. This feature integrates conveniently with Instagram, allowing users to easily navigate between the two apps. Users can access IGTV directly from their Instagram app, making it an all-encompassing social media platform for both pictures and videos.

Facebook is also putting a lot of effort into promoting IGTV through partnerships with major influencers and brands. This move could potentially attract more users and gain legitimacy in the eyes of advertisers. Additionally, Facebook is giving creators and publishers the opportunity to monetize their content through ads, making it an attractive option for creators who want to monetize their audience.

Facebook's deep pockets and intricate user data collection make it a formidable opponent that could potentially topple YouTube's dominance in the online video market. The combination of a vertical-only video experience, longer video options, personalized algorithm, seamless integration with Instagram, and monetization opportunities create a compelling offering for creators and viewers alike.

In conclusion, Facebook's introduction of IGTV is a revolutionary move that is set to change the online video space. With a few tweaks and improvements, it could very well become the ultimate YouTube killer, capturing the younger demographic who prefer consuming video content on their mobile devices, and putting Facebook back on top of the social media game. It's an exciting new development in the world of online videos, and we can't wait to see how it will change the landscape.

Facebook-owned photo-sharing social media platform, Instagram, wants to be the TV for young people. This was made official on Wednesday, June 20 in San Francisco where the company officially launched IGTV, a new app specifically for long-form, vertical video. Since its launch way back in 2010, Instagram has only grown. So much so that it is now a global platform with up to one billion users.
 
Facebook is trying hard to make IGTV the next big thing by luring prominent content creators to the platform. Popular Instagrammers like LaurDIY and my personal favorite comedian, King Bach, are among the first content creators to be brought on board to make the IGTV push.
 

 
To take on the likes of Google’s YouTube, which is the world’s most popular platform for both content creators and consumers, Facebook needs to find a way to pay these creators. YouTube has recently had issues with content creators in the platform. The company is continuously changing its advertising guidelines which affect how channels earn money. Last year, during an effort to automatically demonetize offensive videos, YouTube ended up stripping innocent creators of revenue. Needless to say, a lot of YouTubers are desperately looking for alternatives to Google’s video site.
 
## So what is IGTV?
 
IGTV at its core, a video streaming platform like YouTube. However, it is different in a few ways. First, it’s built for how you actually use your phone, so videos are full screen and vertical. Also, unlike on Instagram, videos aren’t limited to one minute. Instead, each video can be up to an hour long.
 
IGTV has channels. But, in IG TV, the creators are the channels. When you follow a creator on Instagram, their IGTV channel will show up for you to watch. Anyone can be a creator — you can upload your own IG TV videos in the app or on the web to start your own channel.
 
Justifying Instagram’s push into video streaming and content creation, Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom has a straightforward argument: Teens are watching less TV, but they’re watching more video on Instagram than ever before. And that video is often coming from “creators,” the term used for popular YouTube stars, former Vine stars and the like.
 
## How to get IGTV
 
While there’s a stand-alone IGTV app, you’ll also be able to watch from within the Instagram app. This means all Instagram users also have IGTV accounts from day one. This is one of the reasons Instagram’s video platform could soon challenge YouTube’s dominance. IGTV will be rolling out globally over the next few weeks on Android and iOS.
