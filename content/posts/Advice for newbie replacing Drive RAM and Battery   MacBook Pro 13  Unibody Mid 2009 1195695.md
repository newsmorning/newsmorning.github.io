Revive Your Old Macbook Pro 13! Expert Tips For Upgrading Your Drive, RAM, and Battery

If you have an old MacBook Pro 13 lying around and gathering dust, don't throw it away just yet! With some expert tips, you can upgrade your MacBook Pro’s drive, RAM, and battery to breathe new life into it. In this article, we will go over some expert tips for upgrading your MacBook Pro 13, so you can get the most out of your old device.

Upgrading the Drive

The first thing you should consider upgrading is your MacBook Pro 13's drive. This is because after years of use, your storage may start to fill up quickly, and your device may become slower. Upgrading your drive will give you more storage space and a significant speed boost.

The easiest way to do this is to upgrade to an SSD or solid-state drive. SSDs are way faster than the standard hard disk drives that come with most laptops, including the MacBook Pro 13. With an SSD installed, your Mac will boot up faster, and applications will load more quickly.

The process of replacing your MacBook Pro 13's hard drive with an SSD is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. Backup your data: Backup your data before you start the upgrade process. You can use Time Machine or any other backup software for this.

2. Purchase an SSD: Purchase an SSD that's compatible with the MacBook Pro 13. Popular choices include the Samsung 970 EVO Plus and the Crucial MX500.

3. Clone your drive: Download and install a cloning software, like Carbon Copy Cloner, to clone your existing hard drive onto the new SSD.

4. Swap the old and new drives: Once you've cloned your drive, install the new SSD into your MacBook Pro 13. Restart your device, and your new SSD should be up and running.

Upgrading the RAM

Upgrading your RAM is the second upgrade you should consider. If you notice that your MacBook Pro 13 has become sluggish or is taking too long to launch apps, this could be a sign that you need to upgrade your RAM.

The MacBook Pro 13's RAM is upgradable to 16GB, and you can add more RAM by purchasing a compatible module. Follow these steps to upgrade your RAM:

1. Determine if your MacBook Pro 13 is upgradable: Some older MacBook Pro models are not upgradable, so check if your device is upgradable before purchasing the RAM.

2. Purchase compatible RAM: Choose a RAM module that is compatible with your MacBook Pro 13. Popular choices include Crucial and Kingston.

3. Install the RAM: Remove the MacBook Pro 13's back cover to gain access to its memory. Add the new module and ensure that it's securely in place by pressing down on it. Replace the back cover, and you're good to go.

Upgrading the Battery

If your MacBook Pro 13's battery is not holding a charge like it used to, upgrading the battery is the final upgrade you should consider. Follow these steps to do this:

1. Determine if you need a new battery: First, check if you need a new battery. Open the Apple menu, go to About This Mac, and click System Report. Navigate to Power, and check your Battery Health. If your battery is below 80% capacity, it may be time for a new battery.

2. Purchase a new battery kit: Purchase a genuine Apple battery kit that's compatible with your MacBook Pro 13. You can also purchase a third-party battery kit, but we recommend sticking with genuine Apple parts.

3. Install the new battery: Remove the back cover, disconnect the old battery, and put the new battery in its place. Replace the back cover, and you're done.

Conclusion

Reviving an old MacBook Pro 13 is easy with the right upgrades. Upgrading the drive, RAM, and the battery will give your MacBook Pro 13 a new lease on life. We hope that these expert tips have helped you to upgrade your MacBook Pro 13 to its full potential. Remember to always backup your data before starting the upgrade process and ensure that you purchase compatible parts. With the right upgrades, your old MacBook Pro 13 may become your primary device once again.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi All,
Apologies for a question that is no doubt asked here pretty frequently… Im about to replace the Hard Drive, RAM and Battery on a pretty knackered Macbook Pro 2009 - this is my first time doing this and I’m not much of a tech wiz - I have a couple of questions…
Other than the guides on here (which I plan to follow) - can anyone offer any further advice - i’m thinking mostly about what happens once everything is (hopefully) successfully replaced and I boot up for the first time… is there a specific page for that that I have missed in my searches?With regards to the battery - I know I have to charge fully for as long as possible, then unplug and use etc as per the instructions here however I’m anxious about doing this with all the new hardware etc to install etc - Is it preferable to perhaps try and install the new hardware first and then go about replacing the battery or is it ok to do it all at once? I’m reluctant to take the back cover off more than I have too!
Again, apologies if this is total beginners stuff!
Many thanks in advance for any replies

 It’s best to do one change at a time. As to which to do first of the three you talked about. I would do the battery, then RAM and lastly the drive.
Your drive changeout is the more complex! First, you’ll want to also replace the HD SATA cable as these cables tend to fail as you move them about. You also want to fortify the insulation a bit by placing a strip of electricians tape under neath it protecting it from the rough surface of the uppercase. You also want to be careful in your bending of the corner folds, you don’t want to crease them! You want a smooth arc. I use a BIC pen ink straw to help me form the needed radius, it doesn’t take much.
The last issue on the drives is the I/O speed of your system is only SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) so you do need to be careful the drive you use is able to support this slower I/O speed. Many of the drives available today have dropped support for the slower SATA I & II speeds. As an example a Samsung 860 EVO SSD offers the ability to work across all three SATA I/O speeds as you can see in the ‘Interface’ line. Make sure the drives spec sheet clearly states 3.0 Gb/s is supported.
