## Chosen Solution
 Hi there, a slight problem I have with my 2007 Ford Escape 4x4 the ABS light is flashing + 4WD light as well as service 4WD & service brake info messages. Do I need a new tranny? It seems like the transmission has a hard time changing gears.Any help is greatly appreciated.Tony

 ABS has nothing to do with tranny, but if it is locking up it may seem like the tranny is having a problem since the brakes are on. It might also be the emergency brake. The ABS would be a sensor/computer issue. The E brake would be more mechanical and easier to check.
