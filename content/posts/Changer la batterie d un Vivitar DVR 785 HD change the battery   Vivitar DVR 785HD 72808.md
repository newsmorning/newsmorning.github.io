Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Swap Out The Battery Of Your Vivitar DVR 785HD!

If you own a Vivitar DVR 785HD, you know that it is one of the best budget-friendly action cameras available in the market. It has several features that a beginner-level user would love to explore, such as a built-in microphone, a 2 inch LCD screen, and an ability to record videos in 720p resolution. However, one of the most significant downsides of this camera is its poor battery life.

If you are out on a hiking trip or traveling, you may want to ensure that your camera remains charged for the entire duration of your activity. However, with the Vivitar DVR 785HD's battery life, this might be a problem. Thankfully, replacing the battery is a relatively easy process. In this article, we will explore how to change the battery of your Vivitar DVR 785HD.

What You Need
To change the battery of your Vivitar DVR 785HD, you will need a spare battery, which can easily be purchased online. You will also need a precision screwdriver set to remove the back case of the camera.

Step by Step Guide
1. Power off the camera and remove the microSD card and back case
Powering off the camera ensures that there is no in-progress recording, preventing damage to the file system. Remove the microSD card and then flip the camera over. Use the precision screwdriver set to remove the small screws holding the back case. Once the screws are released, the rear case will come off.

2. Remove the existing battery
The battery of the Vivitar DVR 785HD is clipped into place, making it easy to remove once you know the correct technique. Gently press down on the battery at the top and bottom while pushing it towards the top of the camera. This will release the battery clip and allow you to pull out the battery.

3. Insert the new battery
Place the new battery back into the same slot, applying gentle pressure to ensure that it snaps into place. You might hear a click sound when the clips re-engage.

4. Replace the back case and screws
Align the back case with the camera body and push it down until it clicks in place. Insert the screws back into their respective holes and use the precision screwdriver set to tighten them.

5. Power on the camera
Once the battery is in place and the back case is fixed, you can turn on the camera and test it out to ensure that it is working correctly.

Conclusion
As you can see, swapping out the battery of your Vivitar DVR 785HD is a simple task, and it won't take much of your time. It is recommended that you always carry an extra battery with you when using this camera for extended periods. This will ensure that you never miss capturing any precious moments because of a dead battery.
