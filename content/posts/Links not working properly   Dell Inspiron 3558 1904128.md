## Chosen Solution
 When I click on links now, instead of working as usual, I get a drop down menu with options to "open in another window" and related options. I have to click several times for the link to work. This just started happening - I reset with a fresh install of Windows 10 but still have the problem. The new install went correctly and everything else is working.

 That's a right click menu. What you want to do is reverse it in mouse settings.
Go to mouse properties. Click on start and search for "mouse" and it should be the first one. Click on the buttons tabClick on the checkbox that switches primary and secondary buttons.
You may have to do this process using the right mouse button.
Hope this helps!
