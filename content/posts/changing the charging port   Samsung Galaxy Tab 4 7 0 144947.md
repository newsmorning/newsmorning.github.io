Revolutionize Your Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 Charging Experience Forever With This One Simple Hack!

Are you tired of your Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 taking forever to charge? Do you constantly find yourself running out of battery in the middle of the day? The solution to your problem may be simpler than you think. In this article, we will share with you a simple hack that will revolutionize your Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 charging experience forever. 

Before we dive into the hack, it is important to understand why charging your tablet takes so long. Unlike smartphones, tablets have larger batteries which take longer to charge. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0, for example, comes with a 4000mAh battery that can take up to 4 hours to charge fully from 0% to 100%. 

Now, here's the hack you've been waiting for â€“ use a 2A (or higher) power adapter and a high-quality USB cable. The majority of Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 owners use the standard charger that comes with the device. However, using a 2A (or higher) power adapter and a high-quality USB cable can significantly reduce the charging time. 

The reason behind this is simple. Power is measured in amperes (A); the amperage determines the charging speed. The standard charger that comes with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 outputs 1.5A, which is not enough to charge the device quickly. Using a 2A (or higher) power adapter will increase the charging speed by up to 50%. 

Moreover, a high-quality USB cable is essential for fast charging. Low-quality USB cables cannot handle the power output of a 2A (or higher) power adapter, resulting in slower charging speeds. A high-quality USB cable can transfer more power to the device, resulting in faster charging times. 

In conclusion, if you're tired of your Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 taking forever to charge, try using a 2A (or higher) power adapter and a high-quality USB cable. This simple hack will revolutionize your charging experience forever by significantly reducing the charging time. Now, you no longer have to worry about running out of battery in the middle of the day. Try it out and see the difference for yourself.
