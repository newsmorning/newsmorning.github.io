Check Out Our Top 8 Breakdowns in This Informative Infographic! Are you considering hiring someone for your business, but not sure whether to classify them as an independent contractor or employee? It’s important to understand that these two types of workers are quite different, and each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we’ll explore the top 8 differences between independent contractors and employees, as presented in our informative infographic.\n#1: Taxes The first difference between independent contractors and employees is how taxes are handled. Independent contractors are responsible for paying their own self-employment taxes, which include both the employee and employer portions of Social Security and Medicare. Employees, on the other hand, only pay the employee portion of these taxes, while the employer pays the other half.\n#2: Benefits Another major difference is the benefits that each type of worker receives. Employees are typically eligible for a wide range of benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Independent contractors, on the other hand, are not entitled to any benefits and must provide their own.\n#3: Control One of the defining characteristics of an independent contractor is that they have control over their own work. They get to decide when and how they perform their tasks, and the client cannot dictate these details. Employees, on the other hand, are subject to the direction and control of their employer and must adhere to company policies and procedures.\n#4: Equipment Independent contractors are responsible for providing their own equipment and supplies, while employees are typically supplied with the tools and resources needed to perform their job. This can be a significant cost for independent contractors and may impact their profitability.\n#5: Pay Independent contractors are typically paid on a project or task basis, while employees receive a regular salary or hourly wage. This means that independent contractors have the potential to earn more money but also face more uncertainty about their income.\n#6: Protections Employees are entitled to a number of legal protections that independent contractors do not enjoy. For example, employees are covered by state and federal employment laws, such as minimum wage laws and anti-discrimination laws. Independent contractors are not protected by these laws and must negotiate their own payment and working conditions.\n#7: Insurance Employers are required to provide workers’ compensation insurance for their employees, which covers medical expenses and lost wages in case of a workplace injury. Independent contractors are not covered by this insurance and must provide their own liability insurance.\n#8: Termination Finally, there is a significant difference in how termination works for employees and independent contractors. Employees can only be terminated for specific reasons, such as poor performance or violation of company policies. Independent contractors can be terminated at any time, for any reason, as long as it does not violate the terms of the contract.\nIn conclusion, the differences between independent contractors and employees are significant and can have a significant impact on your business. Understanding the pros and cons of each type of worker is essential for making informed hiring decisions. Check out our informative infographic to learn more about these differences and make the best choice for your business.\nDifference Between Independent Contractor and Employee You are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Independent Contractor vs Employee (wallstreetmojo.com)\nIndependent Contractor vs Employee Infographics Comparative Table – Independent Contractor vs Employee What Is an Independent Contractor?

For example, in the US, a company has to file forms 1099-MISC and W-9 when hiring independent contractors instead of form W-2 for employees.Clients hire independent contractors for some unique skill set they have, which the organization requires temporarily. They do not receive any training or material inputs from the clients and practice only a temporary relationship with them.They do not perform any tasks or duties specified outside the contract.The independenet contractor can delegate their tasks to partners or other subcontractors. What Is an Employee? Any worker who earns a fixed salary or wage to work regularly can usually be classified as an employee. Unlike independent contractors, employees work for only one employer at a time.\nThe employer can tell the employees when, where, and how they should do their job. For instance, employers can direct their employees to clock in at the office at a particular time. Alternatively, if they’re working remotely, the employer can tell them to log in and log off at a specific time every day.An employer must provide the tools and equipment their employees need to do their work. For instance, if an employer hires a graphic designer as a full-time employee, they’d have to pay for the laptop and design software that they use on the job. If they hired the same graphic designer as an independent contractor, the contractor alone would be responsible for such expenses.Employers can provide them numerous non-monetary benefits, including paid vacations, sick leave, health insurance, and retirement benefits. The employer withholds taxesWithholds TaxesWithholding tax is a part of the salary an employer withholds from an employee’s compensation and pays to the legal authorities.

The Importance of Correct Categorization Employers need to know how to categorize their workers for tax purposes properly.
