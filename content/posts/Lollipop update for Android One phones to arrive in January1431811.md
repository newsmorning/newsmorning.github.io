Title: Revolutionary Android One Update: Say Hello to Sweet Lollipop Features in January!

Introduction:
Google's Android One operating system is widely known for providing affordable and high-quality smartphones. It is one of the most popular operating systems in the world, and millions of people rely on it to power their smartphones. In the world of technology, updates are a crucial aspect of the user's experience, and Android One's biggest update is just around the corner. The new update code-named 'Lollipop'. The release of Lollipop has brought many new features to the table which makes it an exciting release. So, get ready, and let's have a glimpse of some of the Lollipop's mouth-watering features.

Material Design:
The Material Design is one of the most exciting features of the Android Lollipop. The Material Design interface has a more contemporary look and is more user-friendly than the previous design. Android Lollipop, which comes loaded with Material Design, can quickly change the way you see, feel, and use your device. A new cleaner, brighter interface creates a more cohesive user experience across all of Google's services.

Battery Saver:
Another crucial aspect of the Android One update is the Battery Saver. With Battery Saver, you can save battery life by reducing the number of services running and prolong the amount of time your phone lasts between charges. In addition to that, the Battery Saver mode changes your screen color to black and white, which uses less energy-saving you much-needed battery life.

Improved Notifications:
Lollipop's new and improved notifications make it easier to manage your messages and emails. The lock screen now has notifications that let you see what's happening without switching on your device. You'll enjoy pop-ups as notifications, which let you see why the notification is important and what action you can take. Additionally, Lollipop sorts notifications, so the most important ones appear at the top.

Multi-User and Guest Mode:
Android Lollipop comes with a new update to its Multi-user feature. With Multi-User feature in Lollipop, you can create multiple user profiles on your device. This feature allows different users to have customized screens, apps, and settings for each user. The guest mode is another great feature, which lets your friends' e and family use your device without access to your data or changing your settings.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the new Android One update is a major step forward for the operating system. The Lollipop update is the most significant release yet and it is packed with advanced and exciting features. The Material Design and the Battery Saver modes are the standout features of the Lollipop update. Moreover, the improved notifications and Multi-user and Guest mode features all make for a great upgrade. The update is set to launch in January, so make sure you have your devices charged and ready to go for an entirely new experience. Say hello to Lollipop features and goodbye to the past.

The question about the schedule of Android 5.0 Lollipop update for Android One phones now has an answer- it is arriving this January. Though the update is said to be ready, the users will have to wait upto January, 2015 to get the official update for their Android One smartphones.
 

 
Prashant Bindal, CEO, Spice Mobility, when asked about the topic said, “We plan to provide Lollipop in our Android One devices around January 2015 and the update will be available for all Dream Uno users in India.”
 
Spice Dream Uno is one of the Android One phones, which Google had announced along with two other companies- Micromax (A1) and Karbonn (Sparkle V). Though the statement for the Micromax and Karbonn Android One Smartphones are not official yet, we can assume that they will get the update somewhat around the same time, as they all contain the same hardwares and other features. Once the update arrives for any of the three, it will not take long time to get the update for the rest.
 
Android One phones are the budget smartphones, targeted for the lower-end devices users, with which Google aimed to provide the smartphones with much better features for the people who can’t afford the high-end devices. They run on MediaTek chipset, and have 4.5 inch WXGA Display along with 1 GB RAM and a 5 MP Rear camera.
 
Though almost none of the Android devices with the similar specs of similar price range get the major version updates, these phones are getting the Lollipop update because Google had announced it at the announcement. This is a mind-blowing case for the Android One users, as even many of the much high-ended flagships of several manufacturers will not have the update notification till then.
