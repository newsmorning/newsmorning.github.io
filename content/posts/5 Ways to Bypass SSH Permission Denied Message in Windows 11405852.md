Title: Unlock Secret SSH Hacks: Learn 5 Foolproof Methods to Escape Windows 11's Permission Denied Frustration Now!

Are you facing permission denied frustration issue in Windows 11? Are you tired of clicking 'okay' every time you run a command? No need to worry anymore! You can easily escape this frustration with 5 foolproof methods to unlock secret SSH hacks.

SSH (Secure Shell) is a powerful tool that allows you to connect to a remote system securely. It enables you to run commands, copy files, and perform other operations remotely. In this article, we will discuss 5 strategies to help you escape the permission denied frustration in Windows 11.

1. Grant Permissions

The first method is to grant permissions. To do this, you need to open Windows PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

Get-ExecutionPolicy

If the command returns 'Restricted', run the following command to set the execution policy to 'Unrestricted':

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser

When prompted, click 'Yes' to confirm. This will grant necessary permissions to run commands.

2. Use Enable-PSRemoting

Another useful hack is to use Enable-PSRemoting. This command enables the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service, which allows you to run commands remotely. To use it, open Windows PowerShell and run the following command:

Enable-PSRemoting

When prompted, click 'Yes' to confirm. This will enable you to run commands remotely.

3. Use WinSCP

If you need to transfer files between your local machine and remote system, WinSCP is an excellent tool to use. It is a free and open-source FTP client for Windows that allows you to transfer files securely. It also has a graphical user interface, making file transfer a breeze.

4. Use Pageant Authentication

Pageant authentication is a more secure method of authentication compared to traditional username and password authentication. It uses an encryption key to authenticate you. To use it, you need to download and install the Pageant software, generate a private key, and add it to the Pageant. Once set up, you can use it to authenticate to the remote system securely.

5. Use PuTTY

Finally, you can use PuTTY to connect to remote systems securely. It is a free and open-source terminal emulator that supports SSH, Telnet, and other protocols. You can use it to run commands remotely or transfer files securely. It has a graphical user interface, making it easy to use.

In conclusion, if you are facing permission denied frustration in Windows 11, you can easily escape it by using SSH hacks. These hacks include granting permissions, using Enable-PSRemoting, using WinSCP, using pageant authentication, and using PuTTY. By using these hacks, you can easily run commands and transfer files remotely without any issues. Try them out today and experience the convenience of remote access!

Some users also faced the SSH exchange identification error on the system but the link will bring you to a helpful guide to fix it.
 
## Why do I get SSH permission denied message in Windows 11?
 
There could be a number of factors responsible for this error message, which are listed below:
 
- Incorrect server – If you are trying to connect to some wrong server with its IP address, you might receive an access denied message on your system
 - Wrong password – Some users try to access the server using the wrong credentials
 - Too many SSH keys – When there are a large number of SSH keys present in the system, so the system may select the wrong one from among those accessible
 - SSH key permissions are too open – If the SSH key’s permissions are wide open and accessible to the majority of users in the system, the security purpose of employing the key may be jeopardized

 
If you are encountering this problem on your Windows 11 PC, this article will walk you through the five best solutions available, which are detailed below.
 
## How do I bypass the SSH permission denied in Windows 11?
 
### 1. Check if you are connecting to the right server
 
This might sound silly, but many users tend to make this mistake and wonder why they are facing such an error message on their system.
 
When you are trying to connect to a server using the SSH key and the server address, you need to recheck the server address two to three times before trying to access it.
 
There might be a possibility of missing a few numbers or misplacing the numbers in the server address. So always confirm the server address before continuing.
 
### 2. Try to log in with a password
 
You can always try logging in to the server using the password method. But for this to work, you need to enable the Password Authentication feature. 
 
If it is already enabled, then you can access the server using the following command line:
 
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no [email protected]
 
In the above command, you have to replace [email protected] with the actual server address and password with the real password.
 
If the PasswordAuthentication is disabled, first you need to enable it and then generate a new ssh key using the following command: ssh-keygen -R server.IP.address
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

You have to replace the server.IP.address with the real IP address of the server.
 
### 3. Add your SSH key to the VPS server
 
In this method, you are trying to add the SSH key created on the system to the VPS server. This can be done by first generating a new SSH key on the system using the following command: ssh-keygen -t rsa
 
Now you might have to add this SSH key to the server by following this command: ssh-copy-id [email protected]
 
Here, you have to change the server.ip.address to the actual server address value and execute the command. 
 
Also, disable the Password authentication feature and edit the ssh_config file for changing the sole authentication method to SSH keys.
 
### 4. Manually select the key to use
 
When there are too many SSH keys available in the system, it can choose any random SSH key and create such issues.

So, you can execute the following command for making it choose the SSH key provided by you in the command: ssh -i /users/user_name/.shh/id_rsa [email protected]
 
Before executing the command, you have to replace /users/user_name/.shh/id_rsa with the path of the SSH key you want to add and [email protected] with the actual values.
 
### 5. Change the permissions of your SSH key
 
- Press the Windows key + F to launch File Explorer and open the folder where the SSH key is present.
 - Right-click on the SSH key and click Properties from the context menu.
 - Go to the Security tab and click Advanced at the bottom.
 - Now click Disable inheritance at the bottom and make sure Owner is your username only.
 - If the owner is somebody else, click Change and select your username.
 - After this, choose any other users from the Permission entries section and click Remove.
 - When done, click Apply and OK.
 - This will change the permissions to the SSH key.

 
### Where are SSH keys stored in Windows?
 
All the SSH keys are stored on the system drive in the following folder (replace username with the actual name): C:\Users\username\.ssh
 
Of course, if your system drive has another letter, you should replace the letter in the path above with your own.
