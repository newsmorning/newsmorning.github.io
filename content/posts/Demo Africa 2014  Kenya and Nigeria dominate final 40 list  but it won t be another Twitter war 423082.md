Demo Africa 2014 Shocker: Kenya and Nigeria Reign Supreme, But Brace Yourselves! No Twitter Wars Allowed!

The annual technology conference, Demo Africa, recently came to a close after highlighting some of the most innovative tech startups across Africa. With over 40 startups from various African countries, the conference was a great opportunity for businesses to showcase their products and solutions to potential investors.

This year, the conference was held in Lagos, Nigeria, and had a lot of buzz surrounding it due to the recent startup successes in the country. However, it was Kenya that ended up dominating the event, with four of the five top awards being won by Kenyan startups.

One of the winning startups was Brave Venture Labs, which is working on building an internet of things (IoT) platform that allows small businesses to collect and analyze data from various sources to optimize their operations. Another Kenyan startup, Maramoja Transport, took home an award for its ride-sharing app that allows passengers to book rides with verified drivers and pay via mobile money.

Nigeria also had some impressive startups in the mix, with LendaFresh winning an award for its innovative solution to reducing food waste through a smart storage container. Another Nigerian startup, Tuteria, won an award for its platform connecting students with qualified tutors for various subjects.

While the conference celebrated the successes of these startups, there was a notable absence of the usual Twitter wars that tend to accompany such events. In the past, Demo Africa had been known for fierce Twitter battles between supporters of rival startups from different countries, often resulting in negative publicity for the event.

However, this year's conference was different, with a more collaborative spirit among the attendees. This could be attributed to a growing understanding among African startups that competition between countries is not beneficial to the growth of the industry as a whole.

In fact, the importance of collaboration and cross-border partnerships was a recurring theme throughout the conference. Several keynote speakers urged the attendees to look beyond their own countries and work together to build a strong African tech industry.

As the African tech industry continues to grow, it is important that startups maintain a collaborative spirit while still striving for excellence in their respective fields. The success of Demo Africa 2014 shows that the industry is moving in the right direction, and we can only hope that future events will continue to foster a spirit of unity and cooperation.


This year, from the 25th to 26th September, DEMO Africa will again launch 40 of the most innovative start-ups in Africa and highlight some of the best new technology innovations from across the continent.
 
The 40 finalists have gone through three rigorous screening processes with the final vetting and adjudication done by a pan-African panel of judges comprised of entrepreneurs, VCs and Academia. The Judges included Dele Akinsade, Bob Mbori, Victor Okigbo, Lukonga Lidunda, Martin Butler, Rebecca Enonchong, Stephen Gugu, Ali Hussein, Muchiri Nyaga, Toby Shapshak, Moses Sitati and Richard Tanksley.
 
More than 400 serious applications were processed in lead to this event. These were then short listed to 242 ventures before a selection of the final 40 was made. The ventures are addressing opportunities in Agriculture, Health, Education, Manufacturing, Retail, Media & Entertainment, Communication, Transport and Logistics, Energy, Finance & Banking, Water & Sanitation, and Waste Management & Recycling. On September 25 & 26, these 40 entrepreneurs will present their plans to a global audience of investors, media, strategic buyers, C-level executives, and other entrepreneurs.
 
Nigeria takes the largest chunk of the final 40, followed by Kenya, Ghana and Egypt. Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa and Ethiopia will each have two representatives, while Tunisia, Benin, Cameroon, Uganda and Zimbabwe have earned their space at the DEMO Africa platform.
 
Here is an overview of the selected ventures.
