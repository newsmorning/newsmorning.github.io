Shocking Discovery! LG Refrigerator Freezer Suddenly Stops Cooling! Find Out Why!

As we all know, refrigerators and freezers are important appliances in the household, especially for storing and cooling our food and beverages. These appliances keep our food fresh and prevent it from getting spoiled. However, what happens when your LG refrigerator freezer suddenly stops cooling? This can be a scary and frustrating situation for any homeowner. But worry not as we explore some of the reasons why your LG refrigerator freezer suddenly stops cooling.

Temperature Settings

One of the main reasons why your LG refrigerator freezer suddenly stops cooling is a change in temperature settings. This can happen when you accidentally adjust the temperature knobs or buttons. It is always advisable to double-check your temperature settings before making a call to a technician. Ensure that the temperature settings are at the recommended levels.

Faulty Thermal Fuse or Thermostat

If your LG refrigerator freezer suddenly stops cooling, it could be due to a faulty thermal fuse or thermostat. The thermal fuse is responsible for detecting the temperature level of the fridge, and it shuts off the cooling system once the temperature is too high. The thermostat, on the other hand, regulates the temperature within the refrigerator. A faulty thermostat can cause your refrigerator to work harder than it should and result in the freezer suddenly stopping to cool.

Dirty Condenser Coils

Over time, the condenser coils of your refrigerator may become dirty, and this can cause the freezer to stop cooling. Dirty coils can restrict airflow and cause buildup of condensation, which could lead to overheating. It is recommended that you clean your condenser coils at least twice a year to prevent any issues with the cooling system.

Blocked Air Vents

Another cause for the sudden stoppage in cooling could be blocked air vents. Blocked air vents can prevent the circulation of cool air from the freezer to the fridge section. This could cause the fridge to warm up and stop cooling. It is important to ensure that your air vents are clear and free from any blockages, such as food or containers.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a sudden stoppage of cooling in your LG refrigerator freezer can be quite worrisome. However, with a clear understanding of the possible causes, you can easily solve the issue before seeking assistance from a professional technician. Always double-check the temperature settings, clean your condenser coils and ensure that the air vents are clear from any blockages. With these simple steps, you can keep your LG refrigerator freezer in perfect working condition for years to come.
