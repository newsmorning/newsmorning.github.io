Introduction

Have you ever shut the door of your Kenmore microwave and noticed that the light and turntable continue to spin? It may seem like a strange occurrence, but it actually has a logical explanation. In this article, we will explore why the light and turntable of a Kenmore microwave continue to spin when the door is shut.

Background 

Kenmore is a well-known brand in the appliance industry, and the company has been producing microwaves for many years. Microwaves operate by using electromagnetic radiation to heat food. The microwave emits radiation, which is absorbed by molecules in the food. This causes the molecules in the food to vibrate and generate heat, which cooks the food.

Understanding the Phenomenon

When you shut the door of your Kenmore microwave, the light and turntable continue to spin because of the way the microwave is designed. The turntable is connected to a motor, which is responsible for turning the glass plate. The motor is controlled by a circuit board, which is also responsible for controlling the microwave's other functions.

The light, on the other hand, is connected to a separate circuit. This circuit is designed to turn on the light when the door is opened and turn it off when the door is closed. However, when you shut the door of the Kenmore microwave, the circuitry that controls the light is not immediately disconnected. Therefore, the circuit continues to operate, and the light keeps spinning along with the turntable.

Safety Concerns

While this may seem like a harmless phenomenon, it is essential to note that the light and turntable should stop spinning when the door is shut. This is because the continued spinning of the turntable and light may cause unnecessary wear and tear on the microwave's internal components. Additionally, this could pose a safety hazard, as the microwave could continue to generate electromagnetic radiation even when the door is shut.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you own a Kenmore microwave or any other appliance, it is essential to pay attention to any unusual occurrences. This will help you understand how the appliance is functioning and ensure that it is operating safely. If you experience the phenomenon of the light and turntable continuing to spin when your Kenmore microwave is shut, it is recommended that you have the appliance serviced by a professional. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your appliances are working correctly and safely.

## Chosen Solution
 After removing the hot food and closing the door on my Kenmore microwave the light turns on and the turntable revolves without setting any of the controls.   Some times it does this  upon opening the door.  I have to open and close the door several times to get it to stop.  It does not appear to be heating when doing this.  The cancel button will not stop it.  This is an intermittent problem and does this about10-20% of the time.   Otherwise it heats and runs normally.  Any ideas on what might be causing this?

 Our Kitchen aid microwave does about the same thing when the door is shut except the  turntable turns in the opposite direction without heating.  It does not do it all the time, but it is annoying when it does.
