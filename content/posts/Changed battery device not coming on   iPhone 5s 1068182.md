Title: The Shocking Experience of Changing my iPhone 5S Battery: Device Won't Turn On!

Opening:

As my iPhone 5S started running out of battery frequently, I decided to replace the battery to save some money instead of buying a new phone. The process of replacing the battery seemed simple enough. However, what followed was an unexpected and frustrating experience that left me unable to use my phone for days. 

Body:

Firstly, I researched online and ordered a new battery kit with all the necessary tools. With the kit in hand and a tutorial video playing, I felt confident to start the task. After removing the old battery, I carefully inserted the new one and reassembled the phone. 

But to my horror, despite several attempts, the phone won't turn on. I panicked, thinking that I had damaged the device beyond repair or completely broke the battery while installing it. 

I tried several troubleshooting methods, such as connecting it to a computer, pressing the power and home button simultaneously, and charging it for more extended periods. However, nothing seemed to work. After further research, I discovered that the battery kit I purchased from an online store was faulty, and low-quality materials may have caused the issue. 

After wasting a few days, getting upset, and considering buying a new phone, I reluctantly ordered a more reliable battery kit from a reputable supplier. The shipment took a few days to arrive, and the whole time, I was living with a dead phone. 

Finally, the new kit arrived, and I carefully repeated the battery replacement process once again, holding my breath in anticipation. And guess what? My phone turned on, and that feeling of relief was indescribable. 

Conclusion:

The experience of changing my iPhone 5S battery was a nightmare, and I learned the hard way that opting for cheap and questionable products could lead to disastrous consequences. I recommend going to a service center or purchasing genuine products from reputable suppliers to avoid such issues. It was an expensive lesson, and I hope no one goes through the same ordeal as me.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the battery in my iPhone 5s process went good. But I can’t get any display.   Home button is not working. Didn’t work before and don’t know if it’s phone, display or bad battery.

 Was the phone working before? Do you get an apple logo with the battery unplugged then charger plugged in?
