# Unbelievable! Charge your ZTE Max Pro without a charger - The game-changing hack you need to know!

If you own a ZTE Max Pro, you probably know how frustrating it can be to run out of battery at the wrong time. Maybe you forgot to charge it overnight, or you're in the middle of an important call or meeting. Whatever the reason, you may be surprised to learn that there's a way to charge your ZTE Max Pro without a charger. Yes, you read that right! In this article, we'll reveal the game-changing hack you need to know.

## How does it work?

Before we get to the nitty-gritty, let's first explain how this hack works. The ZTE Max Pro has a USB Type-C port, but that's not the only way to charge it. It turns out that the phone's battery can be charged wirelessly through its NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna. NFC is a technology used for wireless communication between devices in close proximity. It's commonly used for contactless payments, but it can also be used for wireless charging.

## What do you need?

Here's what you'll need to charge your ZTE Max Pro wirelessly:

* A wireless charging pad (compatible with NFC)
* A credit/debit card (or any other plastic card)

That's it! You don't need any special tools or accessories. Just make sure the wireless charging pad you're using supports NFC.

## How to charge your ZTE Max Pro wirelessly

Now that you have everything you need, it's time to put this hack into action. Follow these simple steps:

1. Place the credit/debit card on top of the wireless charging pad.
2. Put your ZTE Max Pro on top of the card.
3. Wait for a few seconds, and voila! Your phone is charging wirelessly.

It may take a bit longer to charge your phone this way than with a traditional charger, but it's definitely a lifesaver when you're in a pinch.

## Bonus tip

If you're worried about damaging your credit/debit card, you can use any other plastic card instead. Just make sure it's thick enough to support your phone and won't bend or break.

## Conclusion

Charging your ZTE Max Pro wirelessly without a charger is definitely a game-changer. This hack can come in handy when you're on the go, or when you don't have a charger at your disposal. While it may not be the fastest charging method, it's a great alternative in a pinch. So next time you're running low on battery, remember this hack and save yourself from the stress of a dead phone.

## Chosen Solution
 I need to charge my ZTE Max pro but no charger.  Is there a way?

 First off, DO NOT do what Albert Gone says. DO NOT. It does NOT work.  It will severely damage the battery and does not give it an additional charge. The phone will say it does, but IT DOES NOT. Doing so will increase the chance of both battery and microwave exploding, severely injuring or killing you.
There is no other way to charge a phone without a charger. Just buy a micro USB one at a gas station or something. Repeat, DO NOT microwave it.

 Put it in the microwave for 5 secs no longer than 5 seconds and it will give you a little more than half a battery i have done this lots of times but try it at your own risk dont leave it in the microwave longer than 5 seconds becasue it will blow ur phone up if leave in there for longer than 5 seconds

 What a jack@$$!!! Who would be that lame?
