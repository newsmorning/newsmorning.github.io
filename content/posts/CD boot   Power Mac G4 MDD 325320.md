Revive Your Old Power Mac G4 MDD with This Insane CD Boot Trick!

The Power Mac G4 MDD computer is a classic piece of technology that was released by Apple back in 2002. It was the first Mac to use dual liquid-cooled PowerPC G4 processors, making it a beast of a machine for its time.

Unfortunately, as with all technology, the MDD has become somewhat outdated in recent years. Many owners have found that their once-powerful machines are struggling to keep up with modern software and operating systems.

However, there is a trick that can help you revive your old Power Mac G4 MDD and give it a new lease of life. This trick involves using a special CD boot disk that can help your machine run more modern operating systems.

The CD boot disk in question is called "XPostFacto," and it was created by a team of developers who wanted to find a way to run newer operating systems on older Macs. XPostFacto essentially tricks your Mac into thinking that it's a newer machine, allowing you to install and run newer versions of macOS.

Using XPostFacto is a relatively simple process, but it does require a bit of technical know-how. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

Step 1: Download the XPostFacto software from the developer's website.

Step 2: Burn the XPostFacto software to a CD or DVD.

Step 3: Insert the CD/DVD into your Power Mac G4 MDD and restart the machine.

Step 4: Hold down the "C" key on your keyboard during startup to boot from the CD.

Step 5: Follow the on-screen instructions to install your chosen operating system.

It's worth noting that not all versions of macOS will work with XPostFacto, and you may need to do some additional research to find the best version for your machine.

Once the installation is complete, you should find that your old Power Mac G4 MDD runs much more smoothly and is better equipped to handle modern software.

Of course, it's impossible to make an old computer as powerful as a modern machine, but using XPostFacto is a great way to get more life out of your old Mac and to keep it running for a little while longer.

In conclusion, if you have an old Power Mac G4 MDD gathering dust in a closet somewhere, don't despair! With the help of XPostFacto, you can bring it back to life and enjoy all the benefits of a more modern operating system. It's an insane trick, but it's well worth the effort for the nostalgia alone.

## Chosen Solution
 Will not boot from Apple Install CD or Diskwarrior CD.  Optical drive kick CD out when pressing "C" key.  Any suggestions?

 What install CDs have you been using? The mirror door G4s are a fussy set, will only boot from OSX 10.2.2(approx and above) CDs, not OS9 CDs (even the dual boot models).
If the machine is booting, check the machine can see the CD or DVDs ordinarily, if it isn't the optical drive has probably failed. The last few of those I've looked at I've had to put a new DVD drive in them as the laser had failed.

 Try holding option down instead, if you manage to boot to the selection, then select the DVD.
What exactly is wrong with your computer that you need to boot from your install disk?
