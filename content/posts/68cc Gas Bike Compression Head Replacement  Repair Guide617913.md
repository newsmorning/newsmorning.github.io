Transform Your Ordinary Bike into a Speed Demon with this Easy 68Cc Gas Bike Compression Head Replacement & Repair Guide!

Are you tired of your ordinary bike and wish to make it faster? Look no further, as we have the solution for you – a 68Cc gas bike compression head replacement and repair guide!

Before we dive into the specifics of how to achieve a speedier and more efficient bike, it's essential to understand the purpose of the compression head. The compression head is responsible for sealing combustion gases and maintaining the proper pressure within the combustion chamber. It's an essential component of the engine and contributes significantly to the overall performance of your bike.

The 68Cc gas bike compression head replacement and repair guide we're about to discuss will help you in upgrading your bike's engine for greater speed and efficiency.

Step 1: Gather Your Materials

Before beginning any work on your bike, it's crucial to collect all the necessary materials. In this case, you'll need a replacement compression head, a spark plug, a gasket seal, and a torque wrench. Also, have a clean and well-lit workspace with all the necessary tools for working on your bike.

Step 2: Remove the Old Compression Head

The first step in replacing your bike's compression head is to remove the old one. Begin by disconnecting the spark plug wire and removing the spark plug. Then remove the cylinder head, being careful not to damage the piston rings or any other engine components. Once the cylinder head is removed, you should be able to see the compression head.

Step 3: Install the New Compression Head

The next step is to install the new compression head. Begin by cleaning the mating surfaces of the cylinder head and the engine block, removing any debris or gaskets. Then, place the new compression head onto the engine block and firmly press it down. Ensure that it's seated correctly and doesn't move around.

Step 4: Replace the Gasket Seal and Spark Plug

After installing the new compression head, it's time to replace the gasket seal and spark plug. Use a new gasket seal to help create a tight seal between the cylinder head and the engine block. Once installed, connect the spark plug wire, and insert a new spark plug.

Step 5: Torque the Bolts

The final step in the process is to torque the bolts to the manufacturer's specifications. Follow the torque recommendations closely, as over-tightening or under-tightening can cause damage to the engine.

Once you've completed these steps, your bike should be good to go. With the new compression head, you'll notice faster acceleration and more top-end speed.

In conclusion, upgrading your bike's compression head is an effective way to increase speed and overall performance. The 68Cc gas bike compression head replacement and repair guide we've discussed is an easy and straightforward process that any bike enthusiast can perform. Follow the steps carefully, and you'll be able to transform your boring bike into a speed demon in no time!

Step 1

                  Compression Head               


 
- 
 - Clean the compression head with an alcohol based cleaner to ensure a perfect fit on the engine.
 - 
 - DO NOT use soap or an acid based cleaner. They will ruin the  compression head.

Step 2


 
- 
 - Detach the rubber CDI from the spark plug by gently pulling up and away from the engine.
 - 
 - The rubber part that grabs the spark plug on the CDI is very delicate and may break with excessive force, use minimal force

Step 4


 
- 
 - Place your 3/8"  wrench on any of the four top cap nuts on the compression head currently on the bike.
 - 
 - Turn the wrench counter clock wise to loosen the cap nut and remove it. Then remove the washer and the locking washer. Repeat this for all cap nuts.
 - 
 - Keep the washers and lock washers with the cap nut they were with on the compression head, it is not recommended to mix them up.
 - 
 - Use the flat head screw driver to remove washers stuck to the compression head.
 - 
 - Sometimes the bolt gets stuck on the nut and comes out, do not worry, this is normal.

Step 5


 
- 
 - Remove the compression head by lifting up.
 - 
 - Remove the head gasket from the engine. Sometimes the head gasket gets stuck to the compression, remove the head gasket if it is stuck to the compression head.
 - 
 - Clean metal head gasket with the rubbing alcohol.
 - 
 - Reinstall metal head gasket on the engine after cleaning.
 - 
 - Without the head gasket properly cleaned and replaced onto the engine the engine will not run properly.

- 
 - This is important information for the next few steps.
 - 
 - This is nut #1, the one on the  right closest to the camera.
 - 
 - This is nut #2, the one on the  right farthest from the camera.
 - 
 - This is nut #3, the one on the  right farthest from the camera.
 - 
 - This is nut #4, the one on the  left closest to the camera.
 - 
 - Pay close attention to the relation of the nuts to the carburetor and the exhaust.
 - 
 - If you are looking at the engine from this view  the handle bars will be to your right and the seat will be to your left.
