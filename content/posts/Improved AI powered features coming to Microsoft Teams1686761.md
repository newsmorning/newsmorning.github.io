# Revolutionary AI Upgrades just dropped for Microsoft Teams - Here’s why you need to check it out!

Microsoft Teams just got a major upgrade! The tech giant recently announced the release of several new artificial intelligence (AI) features, aimed at enhancing communication and collaboration within the platform. The new upgrades are a game-changer for remote teams, and they may just be what your organization needs to streamline its workflow.

If you're unfamiliar, Microsoft Teams is a communication and collaboration platform designed for groups, facilitating seamless communication between team members, regardless of their location. With the new AI upgrades, the platform's capabilities have increased tenfold.

Here are some reasons why you should check out Microsoft Teams' AI upgrades:

## Enhanced Productivity and Efficiency

The AI-powered features maximize workflow efficiency by automating specific tasks. For instance, the new "Priority notifications" will immediately draw the recipient's attention to urgent messages, ensuring quick responses to time-sensitive communications.

Additionally, the new AI-powered feature "Suggested Replies" provides ready-made phrases to frequently asked questions, saving team members time in typing out these common queries.

## Improved Communication Quality

Microsoft has also integrated AI-powered features that improve communication quality. The "Background Blur" function uses AI to eliminate background noise and distractions, significantly improving video and audio quality.

And for non-native speakers, the platform's new translation function can now provide real-time translations in 60 different languages! This feature ensures that language is no longer a communication barrier while working globally.

## Streamlined Collaboration

The platform's new AI upgrades make collaboration more streamlined than ever before. For instance, the "Meet Now" feature allows users to start video calls quickly, even without scheduling them, improving spontaneous collaboration.

Additionally, the "Whiteboard" feature generates a digital copy of any whiteboard that team members use during meetings, ensuring that no ideas get lost. Microsoft's AI-powered assistant, Cortana, can now also be used to schedule meetings, automate repetitive tasks, and more.

## Customizable and Scalable

The AI upgrades to Microsoft Teams aren't one-size-fits-all. Teams of all sizes and industries can customize their experience to fit their specific needs. They can select from a suite of AI-powered features to tailor their communication needs to their team's workflows.

And as your team grows or evolves, the platform's scalability ensures that your communication and collaboration needs are covered, regardless of size or complexity.

## Conclusion

The advancements in AI technology are continuously shaping the way we work, communicate, and collaborate. And Microsoft Teams' latest AI-powered features are a testament to this. They offer immense value to remote professionals, businesses, and organizations, streamlining workflows, improving communication quality, and fostering seamless collaboration.

## What’s coming to Microsoft’s Teams?
 
We know you want specifics, so we’re actually talking about echo cancellation, de-reverberation, background noise suppression, and real-time optimization for content sharing.
 
The Vice President for Microsoft Teams, Nicole Herskowitz, has actually outlined the new features, mentioning that disruptive echo effects, poor room acoustics, and choppy videos are some common issues that hinder the effectiveness of online calls and meetings. 
 
Thus, through AI and machine learning, Microsoft has identified and is now delivering innovative enhancements in Microsoft Teams that improve such audio and video challenges.
 
This means that, even if you’re using one of the best webcams, a room with poor acoustics can drastically reduce audio quality. 
 
Microsoft’s above-mentioned AI features for the Teams software should alleviate this to some extent by canceling echoing, reducing reverberation, and allowing two people to speak at once. 
 
That last feature should also make it less awkward when trying to hold a normal conversation that involves back-and-forth communication.

- Echo cancellation
 - De-reverberation adjusts for poor room acoustics
 - Interruptibility for more natural conversations
 - Background noise suppression
