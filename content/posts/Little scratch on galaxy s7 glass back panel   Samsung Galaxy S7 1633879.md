If you are like most smartphone users, you are probably concerned about the durability of your device. After all, you spent a lot of money on it, and you want it to last as long as possible. Thankfully, modern smartphones are designed to be more durable than their predecessors. But how can you be sure that your phone is truly durable? The answer to that question might be as simple as a tiny scratch on the back panel of your Galaxy S7.

When your phone gets scratched, it can be frustrating. You might worry that the scratch will spread or that it will make your phone look battered and worn. However, that tiny scratch might also reveal something important about your phone's durability. Specifically, it can give you a clue about the materials used to make your phone.

The back panel of the Galaxy S7 is made of a material called Gorilla Glass 4. This material is designed to be tough, scratch-resistant, and able to withstand everyday wear and tear. However, if your phone has a scratch on the back panel, it means that something hard enough to scratch Gorilla Glass 4 has come into contact with your phone. This could be anything from a key to a piece of gravel.

The fact that your phone has a scratch doesn't necessarily mean that it is not durable. After all, Gorilla Glass 4 is designed to be scratch-resistant, not scratch-proof. But it does indicate that your phone has been subjected to some level of abuse. If the scratch is deep enough, it could even compromise the structural integrity of your phone.

So, what can you do to make sure that your Galaxy S7 stays as durable as possible? First of all, be careful with your phone. Avoid carrying it in the same pocket as your keys, and try to keep it protected in a case. Second, if your phone does get scratched, take it as a sign that it might be time to invest in a new case or a screen protector. These accessories can help protect your phone from damage and keep it looking like new.

In conclusion, a tiny scratch on the back panel of your Galaxy S7 can reveal a lot about your phone's durability. It can give you insight into the materials used to make your phone and help you understand how resistant it really is to wear and tear. While a scratch might not necessarily mean that your phone is not durable, it is a sign that you should take steps to protect it from further damage. With a little care and attention, you can keep your Galaxy S7 looking and functioning like new for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
There is a little scratch on the glass back panel of my gs7, is there any way to remove it/buff it out? I looked through some tips on the internet, so far I tried: baking soda, toothpaste, metal polish, but they didnt work. I ordered a Smitty's Glass Wax off amazon and still waiting for it to arrive, is there anything I can try? The scratches are superficial. If you have any previous experience with solutions/creams/tips please let me know. Thanks in advance.
