# Never Run Out of Battery Again! Discover 5 Mind-Blowing Tips to Faster Smartphone Charging on the Go

In this era of technology, it's no secret that our smartphones have become the most important gadget in our lives. From daily communication to work, entertainment, and time management, we depend on our smartphones for almost everything. However, with its constant use, the battery life drains out quickly, leaving us in situations where we desperately need our phones but can't use them due to a low battery. Fortunately, we have discovered some mind-blowing tips to faster smartphone charging on the go, and never have to worry about running out of battery again.

## Tip 1: Use an Original Charger

One of the primary reasons for slow charging and battery drain is the use of cheap third-party chargers. While these chargers may seem like a good deal due to their low price, they do not provide the right voltage required for fast smartphone charging. To ensure fast charging, always opt for an original charger - the one that comes with your phone.

## Tip 2: Turn on Airplane Mode

Turning on airplane mode while charging your phone helps to cut back on the incoming notifications, texts, and calls, allowing your phone to charge faster. Whenever you're in a rush and need your phone to charge up as quickly as possible, turning on airplane mode should be your go-to option.

## Tip 3: Close all Running Apps

Running multiple apps on your smartphone requires a lot of energy from the battery. If you're charging your phone while running these apps simultaneously, it can slow down the charging process drastically. For faster charging, close all running apps before connecting your phone to a charger.

## Tip 4: Invest in a Power Bank

The power bank is a life-saver when it comes to charging your smartphone on the go. It's a portable device that can charge your phone multiple times before needing to be recharged itself. Investing in a high-quality power bank can provide you with a quick source of power whenever you need it.

## Tip 5: Reduce Brightness and Volume

The brightness of your phone screen and volume levels consume a lot of battery power. By reducing your phone's brightness and lowering the volume, you can prolong your phone's battery life and charge your phone faster. You can also put your phone on power-saving mode for better battery optimization.

In conclusion, these are the five mind-blowing tips to faster smartphone charging on the go. By using an original charger, turning on airplane mode, closing all running apps, investing in a power bank, and reducing brightness and volume, you can charge your phone faster and never have to worry about running out of battery again.
