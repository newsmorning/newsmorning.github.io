Title: Scandalous! Is LG Holding Your Clothes Hostage? Find Out Why Their Washing Machines Refuse to Spin!

Introduction:

Washing machines are one of the essential household appliances that make our lives easier. However, LG washing machines have recently been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. They are not spinning, and many people are complaining that their clothes are being held hostage.

It is not just a minor inconvenience or a technical issue. There is a specific reason why LG washing machines are refusing to spin, and it is causing frustration, inconvenience, and even financial loss to some users. In this article, we will explore the scandalous issue of LG holding your clothes hostage and find out why their washing machines are refusing to spin.

Body:

The main issue with LG washing machines is related to their drum bearings. Bearings are small metal balls that allow the drum of a washing machine to rotate smoothly. However, in LG washing machines, these bearings are made of cheap materials and prone to wear and tear. When they wear out, the drum may stop spinning, and the machine makes a loud noise, as if there were a thousand tiny elves inside it, hammering away.

This issue of drum bearings is not new to the LG brand. Many users have complained about it in the past, but the company has not taken adequate steps to fix the problem. When the bearings fail, the only solution is to get them replaced, which is a costly affair.

Another issue with LG washing machines is the lack of adequate customer support. When users call the customer service for help, they are often given run-around responses and told that the issue is not covered under warranty. This can be a frustrating process, especially when users have to deal with it repeatedly.

Conclusion:

The bottom line is that LG washing machines are not worth the investment. The company's lack of accountability and poor quality of bearings not only causes inconvenience but also poses a financial risk to users. If you are looking for a reliable washing machine, it is best to look elsewhere.

We hope this article has shed light on the scandalous issue of LG holding your clothes hostage and why their washing machines are refusing to spin. If you are experiencing this issue, we recommend you contact a reliable technician or service provider to have your bearings replaced. And if you are considering purchasing a new washing machine, make sure to do your research and invest in a high-quality brand that values customer satisfaction and quality.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi I have got a LG washing machine will not go on a spinning at all I empty the pipe at the bottom of the washing machine as well wash the clothes but stop on the spinning will

 Cause 1
Lid Switch Assembly
The lid switch assembly prevents the washer from spinning when the lid is open. If the lid switch assembly fails, the washer will not spin. To determine if the lid switch assembly is defective, use a multimeter to test the lid switch for continuity. If the lid switch does not have continuity, replace it.
Cause 2
Motor Coupling
The motor coupling connects the motor to the washing machine transmission. If the washer is overloaded, the motor coupling will fail in order to protect both the motor and transmission. The motor coupling can also fail due to normal wear. Inspect the motor coupling to determine if it is broken. If the motor coupling is broken, replace it.
Cause 3
Drive Belt
Inspect the drive belt to determine if it is broken or if it is loose on the pulleys. If the drive belt is broken or loose, replace it.
