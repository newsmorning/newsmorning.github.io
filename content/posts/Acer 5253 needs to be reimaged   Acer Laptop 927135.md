Have you ever experienced a malware attack on your laptop? If not, it's a nightmare that you don't want to experience. Unfortunately, that was the reality for a customer with an Acer 5253 laptop.

The Acer 5253 laptop is a great device that can handle most basic computing tasks with ease. It has a 15.6-inch HD display, an AMD Brazos Dual-Core Processor C-50, and 2GB DDR3 SDRAM. It also has a 320GB Serial ATA hard drive, which provides ample storage for your personal files.

However, despite its great features, the Acer 5253 laptop can still fall victim to malware attacks. Our customer was using their laptop to surf the web and download some files when they accidentally clicked on a malicious link. Before they knew it, their laptop was infected with malware.

The malware quickly spread throughout the laptop, causing several issues. The customer reported that their laptop was running slowly, and there were frequent crashes while using different applications. Additionally, their browser was redirecting them to strange websites that they had not intended to visit.

After a thorough investigation, we found that the malware had caused significant damage to the laptop's operating system, making it impossible to fix without a complete reimaging. Reimaging the laptop involves wiping the entire hard drive and reinstalling the operating system, which is essential for ensuring that all malware is removed and the system is restored to its original condition.

Our recommendation to the customer was to have their Acer 5253 laptop reimaged as soon as possible to prevent any further damage to the system. We also advised them to install an anti-malware software to prevent any future attacks.

In conclusion, cybersecurity is essential to ensure the health and security of your devices, and malware attacks can render your devices useless. If you notice any strange behavior on your device, it's always best to have it checked by a professional immediately. Don't wait for the worst to happen before taking action.


## Chosen Solution
 this laptop is not connecting to a HP scanner. HP says the services needs to be restarted and the laptop reimaged.

 @pearlieman I cannot see how re-imaging would find the HP scanner. Re-imaging usually refers to the hard drive or storage media. I would try to uninstall all files related to the HP scanner and then reinstall the drivers that match the scanner and your OS
