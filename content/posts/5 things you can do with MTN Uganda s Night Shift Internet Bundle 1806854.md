Remember the glory days of Waptrick when Telecoms offered GPRS Internet? Successfully loading a page was worthy of a celebration. Those were the days of midi ringtones and super tiny wallpapers. Glory days indeed. Now that the Internet has well and truly arrived and has become a household budget item for many, the question is, what are we going to do with it? 
 
People are looking to Telecoms and ISPs that offer affordable and flexible data bundles to help them stay connected and do just about anything online. One of those internet bundles that excite us is the Night bundle that gives you 1GB of data at only Ugx 2,500 from midnight to 6pm on most Telecoms.  All ye geeks, developers and night owls, here’s a reason to smile into the night.

 
Here are 5 things you can do with MTN Night shift bundle. 
 
## Skype/Viber/WhatsApp/Messenger Video Calls
 
Back in the day, making Video calls on Skype was a miracle but these days we have Viber, WhatsApp, Messenger and so many more applications that can help you make calls or chat with your friends across the world for free. To enjoy good quality calls though, one needs a steady connection and enough data. This is where the Night shift bundle comes in. 
 
## Download your favorite Movies Music or watch NETFLIX
 
With the Night Shift, you can download your favorite movies with no hustle. You can also take a break off your busy schedule and watch some comedy from Uganda’s household names like Anne Kansiime and Pablo on YouTube. Watch inspiring talks like Steve Jobs Stanford Commencement Address or listen to Podcasts of your favorite speakers online. You might be looking for new sounds on Soundcloud, Reverbnation or iTunes or just listening to Online Radio. 
 
With Netflix now available in Uganda, you may want to catch the trailer to that most anticipated Movie coming soon or maybe an episode of your favorite sitcom or soap that you missed. these are just a few of the things you can do with 1GB.
 
## Backup your data
 
If you have ever lost data before, this needs no explanation. I learnt the hard way when I lost all my photography archives because they were not backed up. If you have a computer or smartphone, it means you accumulate data everyday. From new photos, videos to documents and various files, this data needs to always be backed up on the cloud so that in the event a catastrophe occurs, you still have your data. Back up those photos and files on your computer/smartphone using Google Photos, OneDrive, Dropbox
 
## Online Courses and Tutorials
 
In this day and age, modern school is online Whatever you need to learn regardless of your profession or skills is available and chances are that it is free. From step by step tutorials on almost anything to DIY (Do-It-Yourself) projects or even professional courses, all of them are online and the only wall between you and this free knowledge is internet. Use platforms like Udacity, Coursera and EdX among many others to access those free courses. 
 
## Update your smartphone/computer software 
 
Just like your computer, most smartphone apps require regular updates of your software like your antivirus or system updates and these can be quite heavy. On some iPhone and Android phones, you can update the entire phone operating system (If available) which requires some good data too. 
 
Windows 10 as well is out and free for download so if you want to update from your current OS to the latest, the Night Shift would come in handy wouldn’t you think? Not all this can be done in one night, but we’re giving you the options. MTN took a while to get on board but with the millions of subscribers it has, it should soon make amends and perhaps surpass the competition.
