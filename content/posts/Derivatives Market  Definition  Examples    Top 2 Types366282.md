# Unlock the Power of Financial Success with Derivatives Market

Are you tired of making the same amount of money each month? Are you ready to unlock the power of financial success? If so, it's time to learn about the derivatives market. In this article, we'll define derivatives, provide some top examples, and explain two must-know types that can help you take your financial game to the next level.

## What Are Derivatives?

Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset. The underlying asset can be anything, from stocks and bonds to commodities like oil or gold. The value of a derivative is derived from the price or value of the underlying asset.

Derivatives can be traded either over the counter or on organized exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange. There are many different types of derivatives, but some of the most common include futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements.

## Top Examples of Derivatives

Now that we know what derivatives are, let's take a look at some top examples.

### Futures Contracts

A futures contract is a derivative that obligates the buyer to purchase an underlying asset at a specified price on a future date. Futures contracts are commonly used for commodities, such as oil or wheat, because they allow buyers to lock in prices and protect against price increases.

### Options Contracts

An options contract is a derivative that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on a future date. Options contracts can be used for hedging, speculation, or income generation.

### Swap Agreements

A swap agreement is a derivative that allows two parties to exchange cash flows based on an underlying asset. The most common type of swap agreement is an interest rate swap, which allows parties to exchange fixed and floating rate payments.

## Must-Know Types of Derivatives

While there are many different types of derivatives, there are two must-know types that can help you take your financial game to the next level.

### Forwards Contracts

A forwards contract is a derivative that is similar to a futures contract, but it is not traded on an organized exchange. Instead, the two parties agree to a contract between themselves. Forwards contracts are commonly used in foreign exchange transactions, as they allow parties to lock in exchange rates.

### CFDs (Contracts for Difference)

CFDs are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price movements of an underlying asset, without actually owning the asset. CFDs are popular among traders because they offer leverage, which means that traders can amplify their potential gains (or losses).

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the derivatives market can be a powerful tool for unlocking financial success. By understanding what derivatives are, exploring top examples, and learning about must-know types, you can take advantage of the many opportunities that the derivatives market offers. Whether you are interested in hedging, speculation, or income generation, there is a derivative product that can help you reach your financial goals. So what are you waiting for?

#### #1 – Exchange Traded Derivatives
 
They consist of derivative contractsDerivative ContractsDerivative Contracts are formal contracts entered into between two parties, one Buyer and the other Seller, who act as Counterparties for each other, and involve either a physical transaction of an underlying asset in the future or a financial payment by one party to the other based on specific future events of the underlying asset. In other words, the value of a Derivative Contract is derived from the underlying asset on which the Contract is based.read more that are traded on a regulated market. These are standardized futures or options contracts that are traded on organized markets hence require initial payment while entering the contract as a margin. Investors and traders prefer to exchange-traded derivatives since it eliminates a certain amount of defaulting risk and has a standard structure that needs to be followed.

The exchange-traded derivatives have special codes depending on the month in which the contract expires. Across the market, the code for the contract would remain the same. Even if the market price for the contract can be checked on Bloomberg or Reuters using the codes depending on the contract expiry month. All contracts have a generic prefix code followed by the expiry month code and the year.
 
The codes for expiry month are as below:
 
A 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note has a generic code as ‘TU’ so a 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note that expires in September 2019 will have a code as ‘TUU9’.Similarly, a 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note that expires in Feb 2020 will have a code as ‘TUG0.’
 
A futures contract for 2-Year U.S. Treasury NoteTreasury NoteTreasury Notes are government-issued instruments with a fixed rate of interest and maturity date. As a result, it is the most preferred option because it is issued by the government (therefore, there is no risk of default) and also gives a guaranteed amount as a return, allowing the investor to plan accordingly.read more, which expires in September 2019 that is traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), is an example of an exchange-traded derivative.
 
Similarly, any options trade or any futures contract that is traded on the exchange will be an exchange-traded derivative. Equity options, bond options, bond futuresBond FuturesBond Futures is a contract that puts liability on the holder to purchase and sell a fixed amount of bonds as specified in the contract agreement at a price which is predetermined by the contract holder where the other side is the exchange. It can be bought and sold in the exchange market, the price and dates are standardized at the time when an agreement is entered into by the holder.read more are a few derivatives to name a few that are traded on the exchange.
 
#### #2 – Over the Counter (OTC)
 
Over the counter, trades are private trades between two parties. The deal is made between the parties involved and is unknown to the external market.

An over the counter trade does not involve being traded in the market. Over the counterOver The CounterOver the counter (OTC) is the process of stock trading for the companies that don't hold a place on formal exchange listings. The broker-dealer network facilitates such decentralized trading of derivatives, equity and debt instruments.read more, trades are not as structured as exchange-traded derivatives and hence can be modified and customized as per the trading needs of the parties involved in the transaction. Unlike exchange-traded derivatives, there is no specific nomenclature for over the counter derivatives, and it follows the same codes as exchange-traded derivatives.
 
Swaptions are perfect examples of over the counter derivatives trades, although counterparties can also trade a futures contract over the contract when it is an over the counter derivative trade, it is called a forward contractForward ContractA forward contract is a customized agreement between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset in the future at a price agreed upon today (known as the forward price).read more.

In layman's terms, once an investor has purchased a European option, even if the underlying security's price moves in a favourable direction, the investor cannot take advantage by exercising the option early.read more, the European swaptions can be exercised only at the expiration date. The same goes for American swaptions, like American optionsAmerican OptionsAn American option is a type of options contract (call or put) that can be exercised at any time at the holder's will of the opportunity before the expiration date. It allows the option holder to reap benefits from the security or stock at any time when the safety or supply is favorable. A European option is the exact opposite of an American option wherein the option holder cannot sell the option until the day of expiration, even when it is favorable.
