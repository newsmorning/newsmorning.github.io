Services such as Audible offer audiobooks that we love listening to, but some books never make the leap to audio, so they aren't part of audiobook retailer catalogs. Fortunately, you can convert a text or ebook file to an MP3-based audiobook by using a specialized conversion program on your PC.

 

Although these programs rely on synthesized voices of varying quality, they're still a great way to convert your local ebooks or plain text files into a format you can listen to while commuting or running errands.

 
##  Most Robust Text Converter: Balabolka 
 

Balabolka supports an impressive range of text-based file formats that it can convert, including files with the extensions TXT, DOC, PDF, ODT, AZW, ePub, CHM, HTML, FB2, LIT, MOBI, PRC, and RTF.

 
- Opens and converts to several file formats.
 - Installation options include portable and command line.
 - Pportable version runs from USB without installation.

 
- So many settings can be overwhelming.
 - Lacks a modern, clean UI.
 - Hasn't been updated recently.

 

Balabolka uses Microsoft's Speech API (SAPI 4 and 5) to convert text into synthesized speech. You can tweak voices using Balabolka's interface to change parameters such as pitch and speed.

 

The program outputs audio in formats with extensions including MP3, WMA, OGG, WAV, AAC and AMR (probably the best format for voice).

 

Balabolka supports subtitled text in the LRC format or in the metadata of the audio file so you can view the text (just like lyrics) on a device with a screen as the audio plays.

 

Balabolka supports the Portable App standard, which means you can put it on a flash drive and start it on any PC without first running an installer program.

This application (like the majority of free tools of this type) uses the Microsoft Speech API to convert text into speech. DSpeech can encode to MP3, AAC, WMA, OGG, and WAV, which covers most of the popular formats in the digital audio world.
