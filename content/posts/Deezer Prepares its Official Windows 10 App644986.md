# Breaking News: Deezer Unleashes Game-Changing Windows 10 App - Here's What You Need to Know!

Deezer, the popular music streaming service, has just released a new Windows 10 app that promises to change the game. The app, available now in the Windows Store, offers a number of features that make it stand out from the competition. Here's what you need to know.

## A Sleek New Design

The first thing you'll notice about the new Deezer app is its sleek new design. The app now features a clean, modern look that's both eye-catching and intuitive. Navigation is simple, and everything is laid out in a way that makes sense. Whether you're searching for a particular artist or browsing through playlists, you'll find everything right where you'd expect it to be.

## A Massive Library of Music

Of course, the most important feature of any music streaming service is the selection of music it offers. Deezer doesn't disappoint in this regard. The service has a massive library of over 73 million songs, which means you're sure to find something you love, no matter what your tastes are. From classic rock to EDM, hip-hop to country, Deezer has it all.

## Personalized Recommendations

One of the coolest things about the new Deezer app is its personalized recommendations feature. This feature uses data from your listening habits to recommend new music you might like. As you listen to more songs, the app gets better and better at predicting what you'll enjoy. If you're always on the hunt for new music, this feature is a game-changer.

## High-Quality Audio

Another great thing about the Deezer app is its high-quality audio. The service offers high-fidelity streaming in FLAC format, which means you're getting the best possible sound quality. If you're an audiophile, this is a big deal.

## Offline Playback

Finally, the new Deezer app offers offline playback, which means you can download songs to your device and listen to them even when you're not connected to the internet. This is perfect for those times when you're on a plane or somewhere without Wi-Fi. And with the app's massive library of songs, you won't have to sacrifice selection for convenience.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the new Deezer app for Windows 10 is a game-changer. With its sleek new design, massive library of music, personalized recommendations, high-quality audio, and offline playback, it's the ultimate music streaming experience. Whether you're a casual listener or a serious audiophile, there's something for everyone here. So what are you waiting for? Download the app now and start enjoying your favorite tunes!

One of the most popular music streaming service in the world (especially in Europe), Deezer will finally release its official app for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile devices. The new Deezer app will first be available as a Preview version, and only Deezer Premium+ subscribers will be able to use it, but the full version will eventually find its way to the Store.
 
Deezer Preview Windows 10 app will be launched in the coming weeks, according to Deezer’s registration form, but we don’t know when the full version will arrive.
 
Deezer already has an app for Windows Phone 8.1, but it’s quite inconsistent between the mobile and desktop versions. Actually, the only noteworthy feature of the old app is the ‘Flow’ feature. This feature allows Deezer to automatically create playlists for you, based on the artists and music genres you listen to, or mark as favorites.
 
But since Windows 10 apps are designed to work equally well on all platforms running Windows 10, the new Deezer app should be no different, as the sync will be much better, and you’ll be able to pick up exactly where you left of on another device.
 
We’ll definitely have more info about the upcoming app when Deezer launches its Preview versions, so the users will be able to try it and test it. If you want to sign up for a Preview Deezer app, you should check out their Preview Registration Form.
 
Deezer features more than 35 million songs, along with over 30 million radio stations. So, besides TuneIn Radio, it will be another great solution for listening to music on your Windows 10 device.
 
Are you looking forward to the release of Deezer Windows 10 app? Is Deezer your favorite music streaming service? Or you prefer to use others, like Spotify and Microsoft’s Groove Music? Tell us in the comments.
