# You Won't Believe What's Causing the Squeaky Sound from My iMac Stand - Find Out Now!

If you own an iMac, you probably know how beautiful and practical its design is. One part of it that usually goes unnoticed is the stand that holds the computer. However, if you've been experiencing a squeaky sound, you'll notice it every time you move your screen. But, what's causing that sound? Let's find out!

## First, let's identify the problem

To understand why your iMac stand is squeaky, you have to know what kind of stand you have. There are two types of iMac stands: the VESA mount adapter and the foot. The VESA mount adapter is used to mount the iMac onto a wall or an arm. The foot, on the other hand, supports the iMac on a desk or table.

Now that you know what kind of stand you have, you can start troubleshooting the problem. Begin by checking the connection between the stand and the iMac. Make sure the stand is securely attached to the computer. If the connection is loose, it may cause the stand to wobble and create a squeaky sound.

## What could be causing the squeaky sound?

If the connection between the stand and the iMac is secure, the squeaky sound could be caused by a few different factors:

- Loose screws - The screws holding the stand to the iMac may be loose, causing the stand to move around and squeak.

- Worn-out parts - With regular use, the stand's parts can wear out, causing it to creak and squeak.

- Dirt and debris - If dirt and debris get into the stand's moving parts, it can cause friction and create a squeaky sound.

## How to fix the squeaky sound?

Once you've identified the problem, it's time to fix it! Here are a few tips to help you silence your squeaky iMac stand:

- Tighten the screws - If the screws holding the stand to the iMac are loose, use a screwdriver to tighten them.

- Lubricate the parts - If the problem is caused by worn-out parts or dirt and debris, try lubricating the stand's moving parts with a silicone spray or a dry lubricant.

- Replace the stand - If the stand is too worn out, you may need to replace it with a new one.

## In conclusion

Your iMac stand is an essential part of your computer setup, and it's frustrating when it starts making a squeaky sound. However, with a little troubleshooting and some simple fixes, you can silence your noisy stand and get back to enjoying your beautiful iMac.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi I need help to identify whats causing my iMac stand to make squeaky noise when the screen tilted backward or forward

 You’ll need to decide if the squeak is worth the effort to fix! In the 2011 and older models I had ways to get to the hinge without opening the system. The 2012 models forward prevents that pathway, now you need to open the system up and remove the logic board to get to the hinge area.

The Blue pivot area and the Purple tension spring areas can benefit with some WD40. I spray into the cap to create a puddle which I can then dip a cotton swab into and wipe the parts area with the damp swab. You don’t what to spray directly in as you don’t want the oil going onto the logic board or fan!

Here’s the guide you’ll need to follow: iMac Intel 21.5" EMC 2544 Logic Board Replacement
Now a big warning! The newer 2012 onward ‘Thin Series’ require a bit more care as you can damage the display taking it off. First make sure you review the guide a few times as a common cause of damage to the display is digging in too deep with the tools as well as prying! Use the iMac Opening Wheel cutter tool making sure not to go to deep and I like using the Plastic Cards Don’t forget to get the needed adhesive strips as well.
