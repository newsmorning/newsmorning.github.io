## Introduction
 
A sun visor is a component of an automobile located on the interior just above the windshield. They are responsible for shading the eyes of drivers and passengers from the glare of sunlight. For this reason, a sun visor should be replaced immediately if faulty to ensure the driver's safety.
 
This guide will require you to use a drill. If you are not old enough to handle a power tool or do not know how to use power tools, I strongly recommend you use a screwdriver instead to keep you safe.
