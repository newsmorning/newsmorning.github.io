# Your Phone is Holding A Grudge! Unlock the Secret to Fast Charging NOW!

Do you ever feel like your phone is taking revenge on you by refusing to charge quickly? It may sound strange, but it's not uncommon for phones to hold a grudge, especially when it comes to fast charging. If you're frustrated with your phone's slow charging, don't worry because there's a solution. In this article, we will explore why your phone may be holding a grudge and how you can unlock the secret to fast charging.

## Why Is Your Phone Holding A Grudge?

Your phone may be holding a grudge against you, but it's not personal. There are several reasons why your phone may be charging slowly. For example, if you are using a low-quality charger, your phone may not charge as fast as it should. Additionally, if your phone's battery is old or damaged, it may not be able to charge as quickly. Furthermore, if you have too many apps running in the background or if you are using your phone while it's charging, it may slow down the charging process.

## How Can You Unlock the Secret to Fast Charging?

Fortunately, there are several ways to unlock the secret to fast charging. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get your phone charged quickly:

### Use a High-Quality Charger

The charger you use plays a significant role in how fast your phone will charge. Therefore, you should invest in a high-quality charger that is compatible with your phone. You can check your phone's manual or look for the specifications online to find out what charger you should use.

### Use a Wall Socket

If you're accustomed to charging your phone from your computer, you may want to reconsider. Charging your phone from a wall socket may be faster because it provides more power than a USB port.

### Turn Off Your Phone

Turning off your phone while it's charging can help it charge faster. This is because your phone won't be using any power while it's off, which frees up more power to charge the battery.

### Use Airplane Mode

Putting your phone in airplane mode while it's charging can also help it charge faster. When your phone is in airplane mode, it doesn't use any power to connect to the internet or receive calls/texts, which means that more power will be available to charge the battery.

### Remove Your Phone Case

Lastly, removing your phone case while it's charging can help it charge faster. This is because some phone cases can trap heat, which can slow down the charging process. By removing your case, your phone can cool down and charge faster.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, your phone may be holding a grudge against you, but it's not personal. There are several reasons why your phone may be charging slowly, but there are also several ways to unlock the secret to fast charging. By using a high-quality charger, charging from a wall socket, turning off your phone, using airplane mode, and removing your phone case, you can help your phone charge faster. So, if you're tired of waiting around for your phone to charge, try these tips and tricks today and enjoy the benefits of fast charging!

A phone that charges fast comes in handy almost all the time. When your smartphone takes longer (than usual), on the other hand, it becomes excruciatingly annoying. I mean, if you charge your phone for longer hours than you use it, then there’s a problem. If any of the scenarios reflect what’s happening to you and you have found yourself constantly asking why your smartphone charges slowly, then it could be as a result of one or more of the factors below.
 
As a bonus, we’ve also described some fixes to the possible causes of your smartphone’s slow charging.
 
## 1. Faulty & Counterfeit Charging Accessories
 
Bad and faulty chargers and charging accessories are the most common causes of slow charging. Yes, nothing is wrong with your smartphone; it’s most likely the charger. More precisely, if you use a two-part charger (adapter + USB cable), the slow charge problem most likely stems from the (faulty) USB cable. This is because USB cables are generally twisted, dropped, stepped on, bent, coiled, and more exposed to activities that reduce effective power flow-through and ultimately damages them.
 
If your devices charges wirelessly, it’s possible your charging pad/ charging mat is either faulty or not compatible with your smartphone.
 
Troubleshooting and Fixes
 
- Use another USB cable: Before you buy a new cable, you can borrow a friend’s cable and charge for some minutes. If the slow charging persists, you should replace your wall adapterUse compatible and out-of-the-box accessories to charge your deviceBuy high-quality cables made out of copper wire.

 
## 2. Charging Port Issues
 
Sometimes, your phone’s charging port is the culprit behind the slow charging problem. It’s possible that your phone’s charging port has been clogged with dust particles, debris or some materials that are preventing your charger from efficiently supplying the required power. Also, your phone’s charging port could be faulty, damaged or loose.
 
- Gently blow air into your charging port to remove dirt.Examine your phone’s charging port for particles and remove them using a toothpick, soft fabric or brush. Be extra careful while doing this though; you don’t want to cause more damge to your port.Visit an authorized service center in your location to have your charging port examined.

 
## 3. Power Source
 
A weak, faulty, or malfunctioning power outlet can also cause your phone to charge very slowly. The wall socket could be old and faulty or perhaps the room’s wiring, sketchy. To add: charging your phone from a computer or laptop will not charge your phone as fast as using a wall adapter.
 
- Try charging from a different socket in the same room or in a different room/building.Avoid charging your phone from a computer’s port as they are weak power sources; use wall adapters instead.If your phone charges faster in a different wall socket, have an electrician fix the faulty socket.

 
## 4.  Background Apps
 
Having too many applications running in the background not only drains your battery and eat up your phone’s RAM, they also slow down the rate at which your phone charges. Also, using your phone or having too many apps actively running in the foreground can also causes slow cahrging.
 
Trobleshooting and Fixes
 
- Avoid having too many apps running in the background. Learn how to find and close background apps on your phone.Avoid using your smartphone while it is charging.

 
## 5. Faulty/Old Battery
 
Sometimes, it’s not you, your charger, your cord, neither is the problem multiple background apps. Typically, the older a smartphone’s battery gets, the longer it takes to get charged. Aging is a common problem smartphone batteries face. Some OEMs have tried to combat the problem in the past by slowing down their phones but that turned out to be a bad idea. The same fates applies to a faulty battery; it’ll charge pretty slow too.
 
- If your phone’s battery is removable, swap out and replace it.Otherwise, visit an authorized service center to repair your non-removable battery. You may get a free replacement if your phone is under warranty.When buying a replacement battery, ensure you purchase original batteries recommeneded and sold by the manufacturer.To avoid damaging your battery, abide by some industry-standard battery maintenance tips.Calibrate your battery i.e completely discharge your phone’s battery and charge from 0%.

 
Other troubleshooting options for a smartphone that charges slowly include restarting the device or soft resetting it.
