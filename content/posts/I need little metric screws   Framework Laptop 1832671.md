# URGENT: Searching for the Tiniest Screws to Save My Framework Laptop!

As a Framework laptop user, I have come to appreciate the uniqueness of this device in terms of its modularity and repairability. The laptop's design allows me to easily upgrade or replace components, such as the RAM, SSD, or Wi-Fi card, without having to throw away the entire machine.

However, this modularity comes with a drawback: small screws. Lots of them. When I recently opened up my laptop to replace the keyboard, I realized that I had lost some of the tiny screws that hold the keyboard in place. Without those screws, the keyboard won't stay securely attached to the frame, and typing on it is a frustrating experience.

So, I set out on a quest to find those elusive screws. I searched online for replacement screws, but quickly realized that there are hundreds of different types and sizes of screws, and it's not easy to find the exact match for my laptop. I checked hardware stores, but they only carried a limited selection of screws, mostly for larger projects like furniture or construction.

I contacted Framework support, and they were very helpful in providing me with the specifications for the screws I needed: M2.0 x 2.5mm in size, with a Phillips head. Armed with this information, I continued my search, going to multiple stores and even checking the screws on other laptops at a local computer repair shop.

Finally, after several hours of searching, I found a small bag of M2.0 screws at a hobby store, used for model building and electronics. They were the perfect size and type for my laptop, and I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that I could now fix my keyboard.

This experience has taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of small parts in a modular design. While Framework laptops are designed to be easily repairable, it's still crucial to keep track of all the screws and other components if you plan on doing any repairs or upgrades. It's also useful to have a reliable source for replacement parts, whether through the manufacturer or third-party sellers.

In the end, I am grateful for the modularity of my Framework laptop, which allows me to customize it to my needs and prolong its lifespan. I am also grateful for the community of users and support staff who helped me find the screws I needed, and for the satisfaction of fixing my own device instead of throwing it away. And, I am happy to be typing on a keyboard that is firmly attached to my laptop.

Unfortunately, frame.work does not sell these screws.  Thanks.

 Hi
I would try eBay or AliExpress as they have most things
EBay is most likely your best shot but have you considered asking framework directly as I know they are repair focused
They might sell you them if you ask for them nicely as they might not be available on the online store
Hopefully this helps
Any questions please ask
Thanks:-)
