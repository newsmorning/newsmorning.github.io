# MacBook Pro Disaster: After Changing Thermal Paste, My Keyboard Stops Working! Get My Desperate Help!

If you're a MacBook Pro user, you know how frustrating it can be when something goes wrong with your beloved device. And if you've ever attempted to perform a DIY fix, you know that there's always some element of risk involved. Well, I'm here to tell you about my recent MacBook Pro disaster – one that could be easily avoided with the right knowledge and precautions. 

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to change the thermal paste on my MacBook Pro. This is a common maintenance task that can help to improve the device's overall performance and prevent overheating. I've done it before on other laptops, so I didn't think it would be a big deal. I watched a couple of YouTube tutorials, bought some high-quality thermal paste, and got to work. 

The process itself wasn't complicated – I removed the backplate, carefully cleaned off the old thermal paste, applied the new paste, and put everything back together. But as soon as I turned my MacBook Pro back on, I noticed that something was wrong. My keyboard was completely unresponsive. I tried typing, but nothing happened – not even the caps lock light would turn on. 

I was frantic. I had no idea what had gone wrong, and I had no access to my computer. I started Googling for solutions, but most of the advice I found involved resetting the SMC or PRAM, which wouldn't work without keyboard functionality. I was completely stuck. 

After a while, I decided to take my MacBook Pro to a professional for repair. After inspecting the device, the technician told me that I had likely damaged the keyboard cable when I removed the backplate. The cable was sensitive and needed to be handled carefully during any repairs. 

I was devastated. Not only had I damaged my MacBook Pro, but I had also wasted time and money on a repair that I could have avoided. I learned a valuable lesson from this experience – never attempt any DIY repairs without researching thoroughly and following the appropriate precautions. 

If you find yourself in a similar situation to mine, here are some steps you can take:

1. Don't panic: Take a deep breath and try to stay calm. Sometimes the solution can be simple, and even if it isn't, panicking won't help. 

2. Research: Before attempting any repairs, make sure you've read up on the process and watched some tutorials. Make sure you understand all the steps involved and any potential risks. 

3. Prepare: Gather all the tools and materials you'll need before starting the repair. Make sure you have a clean, well-lit workspace and some spare time to dedicate to the task. 

4. Take it slow: Remember that DIY repairs can take longer than you think. Don't rush through the process, and take breaks if you need to. 

5. Seek help if you're unsure: If you're not confident that you can complete the repair on your own, don't hesitate to seek professional help. 

In the end, I got my MacBook Pro repaired, but it was an unnecessary hassle and expense. If you're considering a DIY repair, take my advice and proceed with caution. Don't make the same mistake I did and damage your device – just take the time to do it right.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi!
First time writing on this forum but in desperate need of help.
My MacBook Pro 13” was running hot so I figured I should replace the thermal paste. Popped the back up, disconnected battery, and cleaned/re-applied the thermal paste.
Assembled everything again and started the computer only to find out that only 3 keys are working on the keyboard, preventing me from logging on to my computer.
Any thoughts on what to do?
Cheers
Viktor
