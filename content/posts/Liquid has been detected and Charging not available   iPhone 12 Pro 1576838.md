Title: You won't believe what happened when liquid was detected on my iPhone 12 Pro - charging now impossible!

Subtitle: A cautionary tale about the dangers of liquid damage and how it can affect your iPhone's charging capabilities.

Introduction
The iPhone 12 Pro is one of the most advanced smartphones on the market, with cutting-edge features that make it a favorite among tech enthusiasts. However, despite its robust design and durability, the device is not immune to liquid damage. In this article, we will tell you the story of what happened when liquid was detected on an iPhone 12 Pro and how it affected its charging capabilities.

Body
It all started when I accidentally spilled some water on my iPhone 12 Pro. At first, I didn't think much of it, as the device seemed to be working just fine. However, a few hours later, I noticed that the phone was not charging properly. The battery level was decreasing despite being connected to a charger, and the lightning symbol indicating charging was not appearing.

I tried various troubleshooting measures, such as rebooting the phone, changing the charger, and cleaning the charging port. However, nothing seemed to work. Upon closer examination, I discovered that the liquid had seeped into the charging port and damaged the delicate circuitry, which prevented the charging process.

I was devastated, as I knew that repairing the damage would cost a fortune, and my warranty did not cover liquid damage. I did some research, and it turns out that liquid damage is one of the most common problems encountered by iPhone users, and it can lead to a variety of issues, including reduced battery life, malfunctioning buttons, and unresponsive screens.

Fortunately, I learned some valuable lessons from this experience, which I want to share with others. Here are some tips to prevent liquid damage:

1. Use a waterproof case or screen protector
2. Avoid exposing your phone to direct water or other liquids.
3. Don't take your phone near the pool, beach, or bathtub.
4. If you happen to drop your phone in water, turn it off, and dry it immediately.

Conclusion
In conclusion, liquid damage can have severe consequences on your iPhone's charging capabilities and other functions, thereby rendering it useless. Therefore, it's crucial to take adequate measures to protect your device from liquid damage. Prevention is always better than cure when it comes to costly repairs, so take care of your device and keep it away from liquid as much as possible.
