Title: You won't believe what happened when I tried to remove the back of my Asus Zenwatch 2... I need back screws NOW!

Introduction:
Asus Zenwatch 2 is a popular smartwatch with a sleek design and powerful features that make it a valuable accessory for tech-savvy individuals. However, despite its advanced technology, it is not impervious to damage, and there may come a time when you need to remove the back of your Zenwatch 2. In this article, we'll discuss a surprising incident that occurred when our writer tried to remove the back of their Asus Zenwatch 2, and why back screws are more important than you might think.

Background:
Asus Zenwatch 2 is one of the most popular smartwatches on the market today. It has a durable body with a round display and a stainless-steel back that houses the watch's sensors and battery. The watch is also water-resistant, which makes it a reliable device for fitness enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers. However, while it's designed to withstand daily wear and tear, accidents can still happen, leading to the need for repairs, which can require removing the back of the device.

The Incident:
Our writer had been using their Asus Zenwatch 2 for several years when they noticed that the battery life had started to decrease rapidly. They decided to order a replacement battery and attempted to remove the back of the watch to install the new battery. However, as they unscrewed the back casing, the screws suddenly fell out, and the back cover popped open. To their horror, they discovered that the battery had swollen and pushed the back cover out of the watch. Needless to say, our writer was surprised and shocked by what they found.

Why Back Screws are Important:
The back screws on the Asus Zenwatch 2 may seem like an insignificant detail, but they play a crucial role in holding the back cover securely in place. Without the screws, the back cover becomes loose, and the risk of water or dust entering the device increases. Additionally, the screws provide pressure to ensure that the watch's sensors and heart rate monitor are accurately positioned against the skin. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your smartwatch has sturdy back screws to keep it functioning correctly.

Conclusion:
The incident with our writer's Asus Zenwatch 2 highlights the need for back screws in smartwatch maintenance. Without these tiny yet critical components, the watch's back cover becomes loose, letting in water and dust and compromising the accurate positioning of sensors and heart rate monitors. Therefore, if you're looking to replace the back cover of your Asus Zenwatch 2, be sure to invest in sturdy back screws to keep your device running smoothly.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a zenwatch 2 that needs back screws. Can't seem to find.

 Hi @rsodos ,
I don’t know the watch or the back screw size but here’s a link to the screw parts for the watch.
Search online only using the Asus part number for the screw to find suppliers (other than the one shown if they don’t suit).
Hopefully this is of some help.
