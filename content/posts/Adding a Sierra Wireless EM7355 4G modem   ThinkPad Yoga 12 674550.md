If you're someone who heavily relies on a good internet connection for your work, then you must know the pain of having to deal with slow internet speeds. It can hinder productivity and even cause frustration during work hours. But what if we told you that there's a simple upgrade you can make to your Thinkpad Yoga 12 that can drastically improve your internet speeds? Yes, you heard that right - you can experience lightning-fast internet speeds on your Thinkpad Yoga 12 with a simple upgrade.

Before we dive into how you can achieve this upgrade, let's take a look at the Thinkpad Yoga 12. It's a laptop that's designed for professionals who are always on-the-go. It comes equipped with a 5th-generation Intel Core processor and up to 8GB of RAM, making it a powerful device that's perfect for multitasking. It also has a 12.5-inch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 that supports touch and pen input.

But when it comes to internet speeds, it's not just the laptop's hardware that matters. The laptop's Wi-Fi capabilities are equally important. The Thinkpad Yoga 12 comes with a dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter that supports speeds up to 867Mbps. While that's a decent speed, it's not the fastest on the market.

To achieve lightning-fast internet speeds, you need to upgrade your laptop's Wi-Fi adapter to a faster one. We recommend the Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 adapter. It's a high-speed Wi-Fi adapter that supports speeds up to 867Mbps on the 5GHz band and up to 400Mbps on the 2.4GHz band. The upgrade is simple and can be done in a matter of minutes.

To upgrade your Thinkpad Yoga 12 with the Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 adapter, follow these simple steps:

1. Turn off your laptop and disconnect any cables.

2. Remove the back cover of your laptop. You may need a screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the cover in place.

3. Locate the Wi-Fi adapter. It's usually located near the back of the laptop and is connected to the motherboard with two small connectors.

4. Carefully remove the connectors and remove the Wi-Fi adapter from the laptop.

5. Insert the new Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 adapter into the same slot and connect the two small connectors.

6. Replace the back cover of your laptop and screw it back in place.

7. Turn on your laptop and install the drivers for the new Wi-Fi adapter.

That's it! You've successfully upgraded your Thinkpad Yoga 12 with a faster Wi-Fi adapter. Now, you can experience lightning-fast internet speeds that will make all your work tasks easier and faster.

In conclusion, if you're someone who's constantly struggling with slow internet speeds on your Thinkpad Yoga 12, then it's time to make the upgrade.

## Chosen Solution
 Is this part compatible with the Thinkpad 12?How could I find out?Any particular tips or cautions on process?

 Hi @batlips ,
I don’t think that it is compatible.
Looking at the hardware maintenance manual for the laptop, there is a sata slot and an M.2 slot for storage devices.
Looking online at images of M.2 SSDs that are compatible with the laptop, the laptop’s M.2 slot may be keyed for  B + M keyed devices.
If this is the case, since the Sierra Wireless EM7355 4G modem is keyed for an M key slot only, it won’t insert. You may want to verify this by checking the keying of the M.2 slot in the laptop.
B + M devices will insert into an M keyed slot but not vise versa i.e. an M keyed device will not insert into a B + M keyed slot.
If it is compatible then you will be losing an SSD to install the modem.
The usual precautions apply when working inside a laptop:
Remove or disconnect the battery as soon as it is accessible after opening the laptop (if the battery is internal). There is always power on the motherboard somewhere, even when the laptop is turned off. The Power button is not a power isolating button. You don’t want to accidentally touch something with tools etc, that may still have power on it and cause electrical problems in the laptop. This forum is full of questions by users who left the battery connected when working on electronic devices and then found out it didn’t work afterwards due to electrically damaged components.
Wear a wrist strap connected to an earth point, to avoid any ESD damage to any of the components due to you touching them. Try not to touch anything that you don’t have to, inside the laptop.
Keep some jars handy for storing and sorting the screws that are removed in the disassembly process. If any screws are longer, shorter than others etc, mark where they go. It amazing how far screws can bounce when they hit the floor ;-)
If unplugging internal cables, study how they are secured first, in case of latches, locking bars etc. Do not just yank them out by the wires.
Take your time and don’t rush it
