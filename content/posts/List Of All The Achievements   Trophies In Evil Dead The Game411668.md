When playing multiplayer mode, you should try to focus on completing the game's challenges. These challenges will require you to complete certain objectives during the game, such as killing a certain number of monsters, obtaining a certain amount of experience points, or reaching a specific level, to name a few.

Moreover, you can also unlock achievements and trophies by completing specific tasks or challenges while playing multiplayer mode. For example, there are achievements for killing certain monsters, taking damage, or winning a certain number of matches.

Another way to unlock certain achievements and trophies is by using specific characters. The game features several characters, each with unique abilities and playstyles. By playing as different characters, you can unlock specific achievements and trophies that are specific to those characters.
