# You won't believe what happened to my MacBook! Hinge disaster leads to stunning Display Housing Replacement on Unibody Model A1278

I have owned my MacBook Unibody Model A1278 for the past six years, and it has been my trusty companion throughout my college and professional life. I have taken great care of it, ensuring that it remains in excellent condition, and have never had any significant issues until recently.

About a month ago, I noticed that the hinges on my MacBook were loose, and the display was wobbly. At first, I thought it was just a minor issue that could be fixed quickly, but over time, things started to get worse.

The hinge on the left side of my MacBook started to crack, and the display became more unstable. I knew something was wrong, but I had no idea how severe the issue was until I took it to a repair shop.

The technician who inspected my MacBook informed me that the hinge had completely failed, and the display housing was severely damaged. He suggested that I replace the entire display housing to fix the problem. I was shocked and didn't quite understand the extent of the damage until he showed me the inside of my MacBook.

The hinges that guide the display's movement had broken off causing the entire housing to disintegrate. The damage was so severe that there was no way to fix it other than a complete display housing replacement. I was devastated, but I knew I had no other option.

The technician showed me a few housing options, and I was pleased to see that there was an Apple genuine part that was available. He then proceeded to explain the process and the estimated time for repair.

A few days later, I received a call from the repair shop, and to my delight, they'd completed the repair. As soon as I arrived at the store to pick it up, I was stunned by how brand new my MacBook now looked. I could not believe my eyes; it looked like I had got a brand new MacBook.

The repair had not only fixed the hinge and display housing issues, but they also upgraded the entire battery! The keyboard and touchpad felt much smoother, and the overall performance was much better.

In conclusion, I had never experienced such a significant issue with my MacBook until this hinge disaster. However, the stunning display housing replacement that the repair shop provided exceeded my expectations. The MacBook looks and feels brand new and works like it was when it was just out-of-the-box. I'm glad I trusted the professional team at the repair shop as they did an exceptional job of fixing my MacBook, which I now have no doubt will continue to serve me for several more years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I dropped my Macbook some time ago and the hinges broke away from the display housing. I have purchased new hinges and have removed the screen together with the lcd using the tutorials on this site. I am looking at buying this item of ebay:
http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?...
It is the display housing. I have bought suctions cups and im ready to remove the lcd screen the only problem is I cant find any tutorials on how to remove the rest of the stuff in the display i.e. the webcam and the electronics at the bottom.
Most tutorials are written for removing/replacing the lcd however i am actually trying to replace the display housing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

 Peter that true about not having a tutorials, but it straight forward as you remove the cable and wires. Just make sure start from the bottom middle to the right then top right to top left. then mount them back those steps backwards.
First to make sure MB is just a MB or is it a MBP, because there's a difference on the cover.
the one you have link for is for a MBP. If you look at the top of the case at both ends there's single magnet and on the right side middle there's a magnet. The magnets on top are so you MBP could go to sleep when the lid is close and the side one is the lock.
Now on the other hand MB has double magnets on both top ends and on the left middle a single magnet.
There's a big difference so make sure you buy the correct one.
Hope that helps. Good luck with that.
