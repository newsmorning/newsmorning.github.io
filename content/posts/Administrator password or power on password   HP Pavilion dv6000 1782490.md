## Chosen Solution
 Computer wants administrator password or power on password

 @sentenall you could try to tap away at F11 as soon as you press the power button. This should launch Recovery Manager.  From there, just follow the on-screen prompts to reset your laptop to the factory condition. If you got a halt code let us know what that code is.
