You'll Never Believe This Shocking Revelation About iPad Air 2 Home Button Assembly in WiFi vs Cellular Versions!

If you're an iPad Air 2 owner, you may have never thought about the differences between the home button assembly on the WiFi and cellular versions. However, a recent revelation has shocked iPad enthusiasts around the world.

It turns out that the home button assembly on the WiFi version of the iPad Air 2 is significantly thicker than the home button assembly on the cellular version. This may seem like a minor difference, but it has major implications for repairability and durability.

The reason for this difference comes down to the fact that the cellular version of the iPad Air 2 has extra hardware inside, like the cellular antenna, that takes up space inside the device. To accommodate this extra hardware, the home button assembly on the cellular version had to be made thinner.

But why does this matter? Well, it turns out that the thicker home button assembly on the WiFi version makes it much easier to repair. A thicker home button assembly means that there is more space for the cables and connectors that make up the home button assembly. This makes it much easier for repair technicians to work with and replace the home button assembly if necessary.

On the other hand, the thinner home button assembly on the cellular version makes it much more difficult to repair. The space constraints inside the device mean that there is less room for cables and connectors, which makes it harder for repair technicians to work with and replace the home button assembly.

This difference in repairability has major implications for the overall durability of the iPad Air 2. If you accidentally break your home button on a WiFi version, it will be easy and relatively cheap to repair. But if you have a cellular version, you may be in for a more difficult and expensive repair process.

So, what does this shocking revelation mean for iPad Air 2 owners? Well, if you're in the market for a new iPad Air 2, it's something to keep in mind. If you think you may need to have your home button repaired at some point in the future, the WiFi version may be the better choice.

And if you already own a cellular version of the iPad Air 2, it's something to be aware of. Make sure you take extra care to protect your home button to avoid the need for repairs.

In conclusion, the revelation that the home button assembly on the WiFi version of the iPad Air 2 is thicker than the home button assembly on the cellular version is surprising, but important. It highlights the importance of considering repairability when choosing a device and taking extra care to protect your devices from damage.

## Chosen Solution
 are the home button assemblies in an ipad air 2 with wifi and an ipad air2 with wifi + cellular interchangeable or are they different

 Hello.  For the iPad Air 2, the home button assemblies are going to be the same.  They do not use different home button between the models.  You can use a home button from a different device or a new part.  Keep in mind that the Touch ID function is not going to work at all.  Apple makes it so new buttons cannot be reprogrammed.  The click feature will work with no issues.  Be very careful removing and installing these components are they are very easily damaged.
