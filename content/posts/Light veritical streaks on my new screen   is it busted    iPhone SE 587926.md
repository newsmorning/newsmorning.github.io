You Won't Believe What's Causing These Light Vertical Streaks On My Brand New iPhone SE Screen - Is My Phone Doomed?

If you've recently purchased an iPhone SE and noticed light vertical streaks appearing on your screen, you're not alone. While some people may initially worry that their device is malfunctioning or defective, the good news is that there may be a simple explanation for this issue. Here's what you need to know.

Firstly, it's worth noting that light vertical streaks on an iPhone SE screen are not uncommon. In fact, this issue has been reported by users worldwide since the release of the device in 2020. The streaks can appear in different colors, including blue, green, and purple, and they typically run from the top to the bottom of the screen.

So, what causes these streaks? According to Apple, the issue is related to the manufacturing process of the phone's display. Specifically, it's caused by the bonding process that connects the display to the device's logic board. An extremely small percentage of iPhone SE devices experience a period or change on display uniformity that could include a slight shift in color balance. However, this does not affect the displayâ€™s overall performance or operation under normal daily use, and the streaks should not worsen over time.

Apple also reassures customers that the streaks do not indicate a defect or affect the functionality of the device. In other words, your iPhone SE is not doomed. It should continue to operate as expected.

If you're still concerned about the streaks on your iPhone SE screen, there are a few things you can try. First, you can try adjusting your device's settings to see if this has any effect. For example, you can try changing the display's brightness or contrast to see if the streaks become less noticeable. You can also try resetting your device to its factory settings to see if this resolves the issue.

If you're still experiencing streaks on your screen after trying these steps, don't panic. Apple offers a warranty on all its devices, and if you believe your device is defective, you can contact Apple support to arrange for a repair or replacement. It's also worth noting that this issue may be covered by Apple's standard warranty, so it's definitely worth checking with them to see what options are available.

In conclusion, if you notice light vertical streaks on your iPhone SE screen, don't panic. It's likely caused by the bonding process during manufacturing, and it's not a defect or a sign that your phone is doomed. If you're concerned, try adjusting your device's settings or resetting it to its factory settings. If the issue persists, contact Apple support to explore your options. Rest assured that your iPhone SE will continue to function as expected regardless of the streaks.

## Chosen Solution
 I just replaced my iPhone SE screen with an iFixit replacement. I did a quick check when everything was plugged back in, but the screen & case NOT snapped back together, and it all looked great. But after snapping the case back together, I now have light vertical streaks on the display! Otherwise, everything seems to work fine (home button, ID, camera, etc.).
I re-opened the case, disconnected the battery and display connectors, re-connected everything, and re-tested - same result. . . TWICE! arrrgh!
So, did my new screen somehow get broken, or is there another possible cause?

 The flap you are referring to is the small metal prong that kind of clips into the display.
There are two prongs that go over the earpiece speaker to hold the front camera and speaker in place which is also held in with two screws.
The right prong clips into the display and the left prong also does the same, but that one must be put in properly or it can pierce the display cable.
It could be that when putting the screen into place it may have been put in with too much force.
As long as the corners of the iPhone's metal housing is not dented inwards where it could make it difficult for the screen to go in.
It should be fine while taking note that the screen hooks in from the top first then bit by bit work your way down pushing it into place while applying a bit of upwards pressure to make sure the screen is pushed towards the top to make it easier to clip in as you'll be doing the bottom last.
Once it pops all the way in it should have no problems, it sounds like a defective screen.
Sorry about the long paragraph but that is my experience from doing iPhone 5 series screen replacements over the years.

 Behind the aluminum shield, at the top there is a flap that runs down, it is part of the flex cable for the earpiece, make sure that it is behind the shield, not in front.
At the top, where the red film cuts off in the middle, there is a flex cable, that if you leave outside and on top of the metal shield, it will cause interference.

 Apparently, it was a bad display after all. When I installed a replacement, everything was perfect!
