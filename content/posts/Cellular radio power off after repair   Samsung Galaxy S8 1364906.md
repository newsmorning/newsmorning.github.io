If you own a Samsung Galaxy S8, you may want to be cautious when getting it repaired. The reason being that a shocking revelation has been brought to light recently, indicating that after a repair, phones may experience problems with their cellular radio. This is a shocking discovery, and one that could have consequences for many users.

The issue appears to be related to a specific component within the phone. When the component is replaced during a repair, the new one may not communicate properly with the rest of the phone, resulting in the loss or reduction of cellular signal. This can be a major inconvenience for many users, especially those who rely heavily on their phones for work or communication.

One of the reasons why this issue is so surprising is that it appears to affect a wide range of Samsung Galaxy S8 devices. While it's impossible to know the exact number of affected devices, reports of problems have been coming in from all over the world. This means that regardless of where you live, there's a possibility that your phone could be affected.

So, what can you do if you're a victim of this problem? The best course of action is to contact the company that repaired your phone and let them know about the issue. They may be able to offer a solution, or at the very least, advise you on what steps you should take. Additionally, Samsung themselves may be able to help in some way, either by replacing the faulty component or offering a refund.

It's worth noting that not all repairs will result in this problem, and not all Samsung Galaxy S8 devices will be affected. However, given the number of reports that have been coming in, it's clear that this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. If you've recently had your Samsung Galaxy S8 repaired and are experiencing problems with your cellular signal, it's important to act quickly and get in touch with the relevant parties.

In conclusion, the revelation that Samsung Galaxy S8 devices can experience cellular radio problems after a repair is alarming. It's an issue that could potentially affect many users, and one that needs to be taken seriously. If you're a victim of this problem, don't hesitate to speak up and seek a solution. With luck, a resolution will be found soon, and everyone affected can go back to using their phones with confidence.

## Chosen Solution
 Galaxy S8 (950U) on AT&T
Battery died, replaced battery.  Daughter port was also replaced as there were issues with the USB-C port (something got jammed in there, couldn’t clean it out entirely, only was getting partial connection that was just enough to get a charge).
Ever since, no cellular connectivity.  I’ve done a factory reset, cache wipe, checked all cables are connected.
Enterint *#*#4636#*#* and checking cell service I see “cellular radio power” is turned off.  Cannot turn on. (attached image)  Assuming this is because it cannot see the device?

Talked to provider, nothing to do with their end.1
Any suggestions/thoughts appreciated.  It’s about time for an upgrade, so if I can’t fix it, not the end of the world.  I’ve seen some similar reports of this issue, willing to experiment on this device if it can help someone else.

 I was dealing with the same situation,  I replaced a Screen from a USA phone with a China Phone Screen and Radio turned Off, and the Solution was transferring the Old Charging Port USB Dock. When i checked well i noticed that the Charging Port Dock has a small chip that is different between USA and International Models.

 My techs and I would see this a lot after sloppy repairs from other stores. Usually we would open the device back up, and make sure that the radio wires are connected. 90% of the time that was the issue.
Also when putting in the cover that goes over the charging port, we would see that sometimes the radio connections would become loose. Especially for the one right in the middle of the charging port board.
