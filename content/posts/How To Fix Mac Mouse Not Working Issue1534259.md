# 10 Surprising Hacks to Quickly Fix Your Mac Mouse Not Working Issue!

As a proud owner of a Mac computer, you might experience a frustrating moment when your mouse suddenly stops working. It can be a real inconvenience, and it might impact your productivity or leisure when using the device. However, despair not! There are ways to solve the issue without having to spend hours at the tech store. In this article, we'll share ten surprising hacks that you can use to quickly fix the "Mac mouse not working" issue.

## Hack #1: Check the Mouse Battery

If you're using a wireless mouse, the first thing to do is to check the battery. When the battery is dead, your mouse won't work. If your mouse uses conventional batteries, simply remove the back panel and replace them. If your mouse uses a rechargeable battery, plug it into the charger to recharge.

## Hack #2: Restart Your Mac and Mouse

Sometimes, a simple restart of your computer and mouse can fix the issue. Turn off your Mac, disconnect your mouse, and wait for a few seconds before turning the device back on.

## Hack #3: Clean Your Mouse

Over time, the mouse can accumulate dirt and dust, which can interfere with its functionality. Use a soft cloth or a toothbrush to gently clean the surface of your mouse. Also, make sure to remove any debris that might be trapped in the wheel or buttons.

## Hack #4: Unplug and Plug Your Mouse Back into a Different USB Port

The USB port you're using might be the problem. Try plugging your mouse into a different USB port to see if it works.

## Hack #5: Update Your Mac's Operating System

Sometimes, updating the Mac's operating system can solve the issue. Go to the Apple menu, choose "System Preferences," then click "Software Update."

## Hack #6: Check Your Mouse Settings

If none of the above seems to work, check your mouse settings. Go to "System Preferences," click on "Mouse," and make sure that everything is properly configured.

## Hack #7: Reset NVRAM or PRAM

The NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory) or PRAM (Parameter Random Access Memory) stores important configuration information. If it's corrupted, it can cause issues with your mouse. Restart your Mac and hold down the Command + Option + P + R keys simultaneously, then release them once you hear the startup sound twice.

## Hack #8: Uninstall and Reinstall Your Mouse Driver

If you're using a third-party mouse, uninstall and reinstall the driver to make sure the latest version is installed.

## Hack #9: Use a Different Mouse

If you have a second mouse, try using it to see if it works. If it does, then the issue might be with your original mouse.

## Hack #10: Contact Apple Support

If none of the above seem to help, it might be time to reach out to Apple support. They can help diagnose and solve the issue with your Mac mouse.

In Conclusion
