But one Indian consumer has taken their love for the Apple Watch to the next level by accessorizing it with a unique gadget. In this article, we'll explore why this new accessory is the must-have gadget of 2021.

Section 1: The Indian's Apple Watch accessory

So, what is this new accessory that an Indian consumer has added to their Apple Watch Series 4? It's a miniature fan that attaches to the watchband and blows cool air onto the wearer's wrist.

Yes, you read that right – a fan for your Apple Watch!

Section 2: The benefits of the Apple Watch fan

While adding a fan to your Apple Watch may seem like a quirky choice, it actually offers some significant benefits. For starters, it keeps you cool during hot summer days or when working out, preventing sweat and discomfort.

Additionally, it helps prevent your Apple Watch from overheating, which can cause damage to the device's battery and components. This can prolong the life of your watch, saving you money, and hassle in the long run.

Lastly, it's a unique and eye-catching accessory that's sure to make you stand out from the crowd. Everywhere you go, people will be curious about your innovative gadget.

Section 3: The future of Apple Watch accessories

With the popularity of the Apple Watch continuing to soar, it's almost certain that we'll see more and more accessories popping up to complement its sleek design and powerful features.

While a fan may be a novelty accessory, it's a prime example of how innovative and creative minds can push the boundaries of what's possible with Apple's latest technology.

Conclusion:

If you're an Apple Watch owner looking to take your gadget to the next level, consider investing in a fan accessory. It's an affordable, practical, and stylish way to keep cool and impress your followers on social media. Who knows, you may even start a new trend in the Apple Watch community.

## Chosen Solution
 I’m from India I recently purchased  a US version series 4 Apple Watch with a cracked display.
I had a new display assembly put on, but the technician didn’t transfer the NFC chip from old display assembly.
My watch is working now but in future if I unpair my watch and pair it again or am I stuck? Because I don’t have old screen.
In India we don’t have Apple Pay support yet so I don’t need it.
But watch Is US version even I want to confirm that if unpair it will pair or not
Kindly help me

 The NFC module only deals with payments it won’t effect your usage. Unpairing and re-pairing to a new iPhone won’t be an issue. But of course if and when Apple Pay services are introduced in India your watch won’t work.
Update (03/11/2020)
You’ll need a PC or Mac system which you can setup to monitor your WiFi and Bluetooth connections. Then you should be able to see what is happing when you try to pair your watch to your iPhone.
As an example here is the needed apps for MacOS:
WiFi ExplorerBluetooth Explorer
Update
If you reset your watch you’ll loose access to it! If you  have someone else’s display assembly. A new assembly won’t have this issue.
