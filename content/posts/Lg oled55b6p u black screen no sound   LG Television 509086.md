LG has always had a reputation for manufacturing top-quality electronic products, and the LG OLED55B6p is no exception. This TV, with its sleek design and cutting-edge technology, has been one of the most sought-after models in the market. However, just like any other electronic device, it may, at times, experience issues. One common issue that users have experienced with this TV, and indeed with most LG TV models, is a black screen with no sound. 

If you're experiencing this problem, you don't have to worry. In this article, we'll discuss the possible reasons your LG OLED55B6P is going dark and how you can fix the no sound black screen issue.

Possible causes of a black screen with no sound on your LG TV: 

1. A disconnected HDMI cable: The HDMI cable that connects your LG TV to your device may have become loose, leading to a black screen and no sound. 

2. Powering on the wrong source: Sometimes, when you turn on your LG TV, it might power on the wrong source, leading to no sound and a black screen. 

3. A faulty power connection: The connection between your LG TV and the power source may be experiencing some issues, leading to a dark screen with no sound. 

4. An outdated firmware version: Your LG TV firmware may be outdated, leading to a black screen and no sound. 

Possible solutions to fix the no sound black screen issue: 

1. Check the HDMI cable: Ensure that the HDMI cable connecting your LG TV to your device is firmly plugged in. You can unplug and reconnect the HDMI cable to be sure. 

2. Select the right source: Use your remote control to select the right source on your LG TV. If that doesn't solve the issue, try selecting a different source and see if you get a picture and sound. 

3. Check the power connection: Make sure that the power cord at the back of your LG TV is securely plugged in. You can also try unplugging and plugging it back in to ensure it is securely connected. 

4. Update the firmware: You can update the firmware of your LG TV as shown below: 

- Press the Home button on your remote control. 
- Go to the settings tab and select 'all settings.'

## Chosen Solution
 Hello everyone.  I have an LG oled55b6p-u that a friend was nice enough to donate to me after he started to have issues with it. When plugging it in and turning it on, you get one click and no screen or sound. I plugged in an hdmi device to try my luck and nothing. Tearing into the boards and testing I found that:
p202 sends no 24v signal to the tcon board.
When checking p201, I have no 3v signal when the TV is on going to the DRV-ON terminal.
If I jump the terminal with the TV-ON terminal I get my 24 volts at p202 but still no screen.
Any idea what can be wrong guys?
Thanks in advance!
UPDATE: So looking at things it looks like the main board is the issue. Im not sure what may have failed on it but if anyone has any experience fixing one I would happily take advice on it.
Thanks!

 Hi @bypass21
If you haven't already got it, here's the service manual for the TV that may help.
The no video/no audio troubleshooting guide on p.63 (of 95 pdf numbering) doesn't show much except to check all the voltages on the power board and then replace either the mainboard or the power board depending on results.
Go to p.89 (of 95 pdf numbering) to view what voltages are on what connector and what pin
