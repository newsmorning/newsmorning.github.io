Title: Is Your iPhone 5 Home Button Dead After A Screen Fix? Here's What You Need To Know!

Have you experienced the frustration of having a dead home button on your iPhone 5 after a screen repair? If so, you are not alone. This is a common issue that many iPhone 5 users face after a screen fix. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and what you can do to fix it.

Firstly, it's important to understand that the iPhone 5's home button is unique compared to other iPhones. The home button on an iPhone 5 is attached to the screen assembly flex cable through a single connector. During a screen repair, this connector can accidentally become damaged or disconnected, causing the home button to stop working.

So, what can you do if your iPhone 5 home button is not working after a screen fix? One option is to take your phone back to the repair shop and ask for them to fix it. If the home button issue is due to a mistake made during the repair, they should fix it free of charge.

If you don't want to return to the repair shop, there are a few things you can try at home. The first thing to try is a hard reset. To perform a hard reset on your iPhone 5, hold down the power button and home button for 10 seconds until the Apple logo appears. This can sometimes fix minor software issues that are causing the home button to stop working.

Another option is to try recalibrating your home button. To do this, go to Settings > General > Accessibility and enable Assistive Touch. This will place a virtual home button on your screen. Press and hold the virtual home button until the "slide to power off" screen appears. Release the button and then press and hold down the physical home button until the "slide to power off" screen disappears. This should recalibrate your home button.

If none of these options work, you may need to replace the home button. However, this is a complex repair that should only be attempted by professionals, as it requires opening your phone and working with delicate components.

In conclusion, a dead home button issue after an iPhone 5 screen fix can be frustrating but is a common occurrence. If you experience this issue, try a hard reset or recalibrating your home button first. If these options do not work, take your phone back to the repair shop or seek out professional repair services.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
so I replaced the screen on my iPhone 5 and now the home button will not work.
Even when I short the gold prongs nothing happens. I replaced the gold prong assembly with another and they still won't activate the home button when short them or anything.
Help!

 At the very least, there's an on-screen home button you can activate. Other suggestions in this link appear to be for a different model/not relevant to this issue but maybe worth a look just in case: https://www.cnet.com/how-to/four-ways-to...

In particular: "The power button on the iPhone 5, for instance, was admitted to be malfunction-prone, and Apple offered free repairs or replacements for affected devices - something that the author of this article benefited from."
Good luck!

 when the screen is not all the way in, pressing the side if the phone triggers the home button. I can't see what it's shorting on but it's not the proper pins.
has this issue before on this model. just assumed the logic board was bad
