Are you tired of Windows? Are you looking for a new operating system that can provide you with more control and customization options? Well, look no further than Linux! Linux is a free and open-source operating system that has been gaining popularity over the years. In this article, we will be discussing nine insane things Linux can do that will leave you speechless.

1. Run Without Installation
Unlike Windows, you don't need to install Linux to use it. You can run it directly from a USB flash drive or even a CD/DVD. This feature makes Linux perfect for people who want to try it out without committing to an installation.

2. Customize Everything
Linux is all about customization. From the way your desktop looks to what programs you want to install, you have complete control. You can choose from a variety of desktop environments such as GNOME, KDE, or XFCE, and you can even customize them to your liking.

3. Discover the Terminal
The terminal is Linux's command line interface, and it can do almost anything. With the terminal, you can install programs, update your system, and even customize your desktop. Once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

4. Use Different Package Managers
Linux has multiple package managers that make installing and updating software easy. These package managers, such as apt-get, yum, and pacman, ensure that all of your software is up to date and secure.

5. Try Different Distributions
There are hundreds of Linux distributions to choose from. Each distribution is designed for a specific purpose, and you can try as many as you want. Some popular distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux.

6. Get More Security
Linux is known for being more secure than Windows. With Linux, you can control what programs have access to your system, and you can even create multiple user accounts with different levels of access.

7. Seamless Updates
Updating your system on Linux is a breeze. Unlike Windows, where updates can take forever, Linux updates are quick and seamless. Just run a simple command, and your system will be up to date.

8. Access to the Source Code
One of the biggest advantages of Linux is its open-source nature. You have access to the source code, which means you can modify it to your needs. This level of control is something you don't get with Windows.

9. No Need for Antivirus Software
Linux is immune to most viruses that affect Windows. This means that you don't need to install any antivirus software, saving you money and resources.

In conclusion, Linux is a powerful operating system that provides users with endless options and control. From customization to security, Linux has something for everyone. If you're tired of Windows and want to try something new, give Linux a shot. You won't be disappointed.

Think Windows is the only operating system out
there? Think again.  Have you heard of
Linux?
 
Linux and Windows are considered to be the world’s best-operating systems. When deciding whether to choose a Windows or Linux operating system, most people look at features such as cost, support, security, functionality, hardware compatibility, and reliability.
 
Before deciding to leave Windows for Linux, look at some of the advantages of Linux as well as things Linux can do that Windows cannot.
 

 
## Open Source
 
One of the best advantages Linux offers is
that it is an open-source operating system (OS). 
 
This means that its source code is available for anyone who needs or wants to see, edit, or modify it. This feature is especially useful to coders and developers who have the ability and need to modify or enhance the code.
 
Open source is also more secure because everyone is looking at and checking others’ work. It is a world-wide project that anyone can access. Whereas, Windows is a closed system that consists of layers and layers of locked down source code.
 
## Total Cost
 
The obvious advantage to users is that Linux
is free, whereas Windows is not. Even the related applications for the Linux OS
cost $0.
 
The cost of a Window’s license varies
depending upon whether it is for a server or a desktop. Also, the price can be
very steep when purchased for a business.
 
The more employees a business has, the higher the cost. Companies also need to pay for the applications that run on Windows such as Exchange and MS Office. There is no distinction with Linux. It is still free. Linux users can download the source code and modify it without spending any money.
 
Some Linux distributions might charge for
support. However, the cost is much less than purchasing a license for Windows.  
 
## Less Time to Update
 
Linux users have complete control over software updates. They can install them whenever they need or want. Not only do the updates take less time than Windows, but there is also no need to reboot your computer.
 
Having to reboot your computer every time you perform an update can be disruptive. People who use Windows must reboot every time they install an update. They are also reminded in an annoying pop up that their system will reboot in 10 minutes. Linux removes that distraction.
 
Linux takes far less time to reboot or load
after being powered off than any version of Windows.
 
## Stability and Reliability
 
As mentioned above, Windows requires users to
reboot their computer after installing updates. 
 
Computers running on Linux can technically continue to operate without rebooting and without any issues for years.
 
It is rare for a Linux system to freeze or
slow down. Whereas with Windows, if you are running too many applications or
have too many browsers open at one time, it is more common than not that your
computer will freeze.
 
When it freezes, if you haven’t saved what you
have been working on, you will lose it. The only way to unfreeze a system
running on Windows is to manually stop the task that is causing the problem.
 
## Better Security
 
Windows is vulnerable to many different types of viruses, malware, and trojans. Users who install Windows know that they also need to purchase and download antivirus programs to protect their computers.
 
Although no operating system is exempt from hacks, Linux makes it more difficult due to its inherent design. Any program or application in a Linux environment requires administrative authorization in the form of a password.
 
Viruses will not be allowed to execute unless
the password is typed correctly.
 
## Hardware Compatibility and Resources
 
While it’s true that Windows is compatible with other hardware, Linux is different. What if you find an old laptop that might be running XP?
 
You can’t install an updated version of
Windows on that laptop and expect it to run. It won’t. However, you can
revitalize it by installing Linux, and it will run smoothly.
 
Rather than throw out old computers, why not take advantage of Linux’s ability to revive it? Several lightweight distributions can restore even a 15-year old piece of hardware to a functioning system. You can find many videos on how to install Linux on YouTube. 
 
One of the reasons Windows systems freeze is
because you are using up too many resources. Linux systems are known to take better
advantage of the hardware and use fewer resources such as disk space and RAM.
 
## Ability to Customize
 
Linux allows you to customize any feature you
want such as:
 
- Add or delete featuresTweak how your system looksInstall themesChoose the icons you preferChange your file managerCustomize your desktop environment

 
While you can customize some features in
Windows, your options are limited. Almost every aspect of the Linux system has
options that you can choose to customize.
 
See the samples below for different ways to
customize your desktop environment.
 
## Better Support
 
One of the many benefits of open source
systems is the availability of finding solutions to your problems or issues in
the community of users.
 
If you are looking for an answer to a question on your Linux system, search online for a thread about your specific issue. If you can’t find one, start a new thread on a Linux forum. You will get a detailed response at no cost.
 
## Privacy
 
Microsoft’s latest version Windows 10 has
received a lot of criticism about how it collects data. All privacy settings
are enabled by default.
 
If you are concerned about your privacy, Linux is the best solution for you. Linux distributions don’t collect much if any, data. Linux doesn’t upload data or generate logs from your computer as Windows does.
 
And more importantly, you don’t need additional tools to protect your privacy. Now that you know what Linux can do that Windows cannot, you can make a more informed decision when choosing an operating system.
