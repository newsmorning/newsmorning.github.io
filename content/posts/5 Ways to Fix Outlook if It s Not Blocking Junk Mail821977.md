The good news is that there are several Outlook fixes that you can use to stop junk mail from swarming your inbox. In this article, we will discover the top 5 Outlook fixes that will help you manage your inbox more effectively.

# 1. Turn on Junk Mail Filtering:

Outlook has a built-in feature that filters out junk mail so that it does not appear in your inbox. To turn on junk mail filtering, go to the "Home" tab in Outlook and click on "Junk" in the "Delete" group. In the drop-down menu, select "Junk E-mail Options." In the "Options" tab, you can choose the level of filtering you prefer. Selecting "High" will filter out the most junk mail, while "Low" will filter out the least.

# 2. Use Rules to Automatically Move Junk Mail:

You can use rules in Outlook to automatically move junk mail to a separate folder. This will keep your inbox clutter-free and make it easier to find important emails. To create a rule, go to the "Home" tab and click on "Rules" in the "Move" group. In the drop-down menu, select "Create Rule." You can then choose the criteria for the rule, such as "Sender Contains" or "Subject Contains." Finally, choose the folder where you want the junk mail to go.

# 3. Block Senders:

If you receive junk mail from a particular sender on a regular basis, you can block that sender in Outlook. To do this, simply right-click on the email from the sender you want to block, and click on "Junk" in the drop-down menu. Then select "Block Sender" to add the sender to your blocked list.

# 4. Use Spam Filters:

Third-party spam filters can be very effective at blocking junk mail. You can download one of the many available spam filters, such as Spamihilator or Spamfighter, to help you manage your inbox. These filters work by filtering out emails based on certain criteria, such as the sender, subject line, or content.

# 5. Unsubscribe from Junk Mail:

Finally, one of the most effective ways to stop junk mail from swarming your inbox is to unsubscribe from it. Many companies and organizations provide an unsubscribe link at the bottom of their marketing emails. Click on this link to be taken to a page where you can unsubscribe from their mailing list.

### How does Outlook’s Junk Email Filter work?
 
Outlook’s Junk Email Filter works by scanning emails’ headers, addresses, and message contents. The header analysis is often enough to identify spoof (spam) messages.
 
If any aspect of an email looks suspicious, Outlook’s Junk Email Filter redirects it to the Junk Email folder. Outlook automatically deletes all junk messages there after 30 days.
