# Is your 2005-2010 Kia Sportage stalling and struggling to accelerate? Look no further for the ultimate fix!

If you own a 2005-2010 Kia Sportage and are facing issues with stalling and struggling to accelerate, you are not alone. Many owners of the popular SUV have reported similar issues, which can be frustrating and even dangerous in some cases.

But instead of taking your vehicle to the mechanic and spending a hefty sum on repairs, there is an ultimate fix for this problem that you can do yourself. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to fix your Kia Sportage and get it running smoothly again.

## Understanding the problem

Before we get started with the fix, it’s important to understand the root of the problem. The stalling and struggling to accelerate in a Kia Sportage are often caused by a faulty throttle position sensor. This sensor tells the engine control module how much the throttle is open, which in turn controls the amount of air and fuel that enter the engine.

If the sensor is not functioning properly, it can cause erratic readings, leading to a rough idle, stalling, and sluggish acceleration.

## The ultimate fix

The ultimate fix for this problem is to replace the faulty throttle position sensor. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Start by disconnecting the negative terminal on your car’s battery to prevent any electrical shock.

2. Locate the throttle position sensor. It’s usually located on the throttle body, which is attached to the air intake system.

3. Remove the electrical connector from the sensor by pressing the tab and pulling it out.

4. Loosen the screws that hold the sensor to the throttle body using a screwdriver. Be careful not to strip the screws.

5. Remove the old throttle position sensor and discard it.

6. Install the new throttle position sensor in place of the old one, making sure it’s properly aligned and tightened.

7. Reconnect the electrical connector to the sensor by pressing it until you hear a click.

8. Reconnect the negative terminal on your car’s battery.

9. Start your engine and check if the stalling and acceleration issues have been resolved.

Congratulations, you’ve successfully fixed your Kia Sportage! You can now enjoy a smooth drive without any interruption.

## Conclusion

If your 2005-2010 Kia Sportage is stalling and struggling to accelerate, don’t worry. This is a common problem that can be fixed easily by replacing the faulty throttle position sensor. With the above guide, you can do it yourself without spending a lot of money on repairs.

However, if you’re not confident in your ability to replace the sensor, don’t hesitate to take your car to a trusted mechanic. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.

## Chosen Solution
 So a few weeks ago I had drivin to Joplin (100 miles away) and had the car going non stop running around for 10 hours in bad heat. Then on the way back on the hwy I was going around 70 and the car started jutting the eventuality lost acceleration and then stalled (3 miles from my house of course). Fast forward to today and at a stop I go to press on the gas to take off I couldn’t get the car to accelerate at all for 4-5 seconds then it all the sudden accelerated. When I got home and pulled into the driveway and put it in park the rpm kept going to up and down between 500 to 1000 rpm. Up, a second later down and second later up and so forth. Any ideas out there??
Update (07/29/2019)
So since this post I’ve had the issue pop up maybe 4-5 times. The check engine stayed on for awhile but now is off most of the time. Yesterday I got new tires due to another issue I’ve been dealing with and ask a tech how much change the spark plugs. He took the plastic cover off the manifold and I noticed at the right of it was a small hose coming from that plastic piece I believe you mentioned ( in the picture). The hose looks kind of melted, cracked and is very loose. I can’t seem to find a diagram to tell me what it’s called so I can price/replace it.

 Thanks for the additional info, Michael.
My instinct here is the throttle position sensor (TPS), which can be checked fairly easily with a multi-meter. Have your mechanic take a look at this for you. Otherwise, it’s not very complicated. If you have, and know how to use, a multi-meter, it’s a test you may can do yourself. Lots of videos out there demonstrating the actual step by step on how to test a TPS, without removing any parts. A replacement TPS is not terribly expensive and it’s also a fairly easy procedure, if this turns out to be the problem.
While you’re working right there with/around the throttle body, and especially if the sensor checks ok, you may want to remove the air intake to expose the throttle plate, and inspect it for carbon build up on the edges which could interfere with the throttle plate action. Also make sure nothing associated with moving the throttle is mechanically binding, etc., as in this action the movement needs to be fairly smooth.
Otherwise, briefly, after eliminating the TPS as the culprit, here’s the order I might go at:
check fuel pressure - if not ok, check fuel pump; if ok, assume pump/pressure ok.
check for spark - if not getting spark (at the cylinders), check rotor button, distributor cap & wires;  if getting spark at cylinders, check ignition coils and spark plugs.
Hope this helps. Good Luck.
