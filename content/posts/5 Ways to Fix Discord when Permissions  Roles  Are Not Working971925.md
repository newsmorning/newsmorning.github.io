# You won't believe how easy it is to fix Discord Permissions and Roles - 5 hacks revealed!

Discord is one of the most popular platforms for online communication, especially among gamers. It allows you to create a server or join an existing one, where you can chat, share media, and play games with other like-minded individuals. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and if you're the owner or administrator of a Discord server, you need to administer it properly to ensure that everything runs smoothly. One of the most critical aspects of server administration is managing Discord permissions and roles. In this article, we'll reveal five hacks that will make fixing Discord permissions and roles easier than ever before.

## Hack #1: Understand the Hierarchy

Discord has a hierarchical system for managing permissions and roles in a server. This system is divided into four levels, which are:

- Server Owner: The person who created the server and has full control over it.

- Server Manager: A person assigned by the server owner to manage the server.

- Role: A set of permissions assigned to a user based on their role in the server.

- Channel: A specific chatroom within the server.

To manage permissions effectively, you must understand the hierarchy and know how to assign permission sets for each level.

## Hack #2: Use Discord's Permission Calculator

Discord provides a built-in permission calculator that you can use to assign permission sets to users. The permission calculator enables you to define permission sets for roles, channels, and users. It can also calculate permission sets based on the combination of roles assigned to a user. This feature makes it easy to manage permission sets for large servers.

## Hack #3: Create Custom Roles with Appropriate Permissions

By default, Discord provides several predefined roles that you can assign to users, such as admin, moderator, and member. However, you may need to create custom roles for your server, especially if you have a unique type of server. Custom roles allow you to define specific permission sets that match the user's job or activity. For example, if you have a gaming server that contains several games, you can create roles corresponding to each game and assign appropriate permissions to members based on their preferred game.

## Hack #4: Use Discord's Audit Log

Discord's audit log is a valuable tool that records all actions and changes made to a server. It allows you to track any suspicious activity, such as the addition or removal of roles, channels, or users. You can also filter the audit log to show specific actions by a user, date range, or action type. By reviewing the audit log regularly, you can identify any issues and take corrective action before they escalate.

## Hack #5: Delegate Tasks to Trusted Members

If you're managing a large server, it can be challenging to keep track of everything. In such cases, it's always a good idea to delegate tasks to trusted members who can assist you with tasks such as server maintenance, content moderation, and even permission management. You can assign roles and permissions accordingly to your team members, so that they can assist you with specific tasks in the server.

## Conclusion

Managing Discord permissions and roles isn't complicated when you know what you're doing. By understanding the hierarchy, creating custom roles, using the permission calculator, reviewing the audit log and delegating tasks to trusted members, you can efficiently manage your server and ensure that everything runs smoothly. These five hacks will make managing permissions and roles on Discord easier than you ever thought possible. So, what are you waiting for? Log on to Discord now and get managing your server like a pro.

## Why are permissions (roles) not working in Discord?
 
The factors which can be responsible for this issue in Discord are listed below:
 
- Discord’s corrupted files – When the files of the Discord application and its cache get corrupted, it might create problems related to permissions
 - Permission feature of members – The issue arises if the permissions (roles) have not been set properly for most of the server members
 - Poor Internet connection – The weak and unstable Internet connection creates problems like those mentioned above

 
There are a few fixes mentioned below in this article that can resolve this problem.
 
## How do I fix Discord when permissions (roles) are not working?
 
### 1. Check your Internet connection
 
Try rebooting your Wi-Fi router and reconnecting it to the system. Also, unplug the ethernet connection wire from the system and replug it after some time. 
 

 
How to keep Discord running without problems?
 
Discord is now the only free messaging tool that keeps you connected to all your gaming communication channels. To be safe from getting connection, server or simply login errors, you could use Opera GX, the only gaming browser with Discord integration and optimization.
 
Opera GX keeps you logged in, so you won’t have any authentication issues. Moreover, if you do, you may always change access servers by using Opera’s free built-in VPN feature. Last, but not least, you can choose how many resources shall each tab consume so you could have all PC’s power focused on your main activities like gaming, trading, editing, etc.

This will re-establish and stabilize the Internet connection on the system. Call your service provider if nothing works.
 
### 2. Override the channel
 
The only way you can override any channel is to add a single admin role to the server. After doing this, you need to enable the Manage Messages option for that server.
 
Once you do these changes, the permissions in Discord will work again normally. 
 
### 3. Verify every member’s role
 
There are around 250 roles that you can assign to each and every member of the server group. 
 
When too many users have the same role assigned, it will create such issues and those permissions won’t be working.
 
So, make sure every member has a role assigned to them they deserve and is fair to other members.
 
### 4. Clear Discord’s cache
 
- Press the Windows and R keys together and type %appdata%\discord and press the Enter key.
 - In the Discord folder, delete Cache, Code Cache, and GPUCache folders by selecting them and pressing the Delete key.
 - Now go to Desktop (Win + D) and right-click on the Recycle Bin and click Empty Recycle Bin from the menu.
 - This will clear the Discord application’s cache on the system.

 
### 5. Reinstall the Discord app
 
- Press the Windows key + R to open the Run console, type appwiz.cpl, and press the Enter key.
 - Select Discord from the list and click Uninstall.
 - This will start uninstalling the Discord application.
 - Now visit Discord’s downloads page and click Download for Windows.
 - After that, install the Discord app by double-clicking the DiscordSetup file and then following the onscreen instructions.

 
### Can you remove your own roles on Discord?
 
No! You can never remove or change your own roles in Discord. The admin or the moderator of the server will be able to do it for you. You need to request someone who has higher power than you can do it.
 
To stay in touch with your friends on Discord, you can do some changes in Discord for getting unbanned from the Discord server.
