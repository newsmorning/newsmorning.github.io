# SHOCKING life hack revealed: Unplugging and plugging your GE Profile refrigerator will change the game!

Is your GE Profile refrigerator giving you a headache with its constant beeping and unresponsive display panel? Look no further, as we have a life hack that will change the game!

Simply unplug your refrigerator from the power outlet and wait for approximately 30 seconds before plugging it back in. This simple action can reset the refrigerator's control board and solve the issues that you may have been experiencing.

But why does this work, you ask?

Well, electronic appliances like refrigerators have control boards that manage and regulate their operations. These control boards can sometimes malfunction due to power surges or other electrical problems, which result in issues like beeping sounds and an unresponsive display panel.

By unplugging the refrigerator from the power source, you're essentially cutting off its power supply, which forces the control board to shut down completely. When you plug your refrigerator back in, the control board restarts, which can often solve the malfunctions that you have been experiencing.

It's an incredibly simple solution that could save you money on repairs or even costlier replacements. Plus, it's a great way to troubleshoot problems quickly and efficiently.

In addition to solving problems, unplugging and plugging back in your GE Profile refrigerator can also help it run more efficiently. When you've had your refrigerator for a while, there's a chance that some of its internal components, like the compressor, may begin to wear down. By unplugging the refrigerator every once in a while, you're effectively resetting these components, which can help extend its lifespan.

So, the next time your GE Profile refrigerator is acting up, try unplugging it for 30 seconds before plugging it back in. You might just be surprised by how effective this simple hack can be!

So first time I noticed the freezer temperature  went up to 20+ degrees I did the unplug and plug in, it went back to normal, but only for a day or two, the problem comes back, then i have to do it again, and now it stays that way. Please help Thank you!

 Hi,
Can you hear if the evaporator fan in the freezer compartment is running when the temp is 20 F?
The fan should stop when a door is opened and start again when the door (both doors) are shut.
The evaporator fan will be running as long as the compressor is running. Do not confuse this fan with the condenser fan which is located outside the compartments near the compressor and can operate regardless of whether the doors are open or shut.
If you can’t hear the evaporator fan running at all, disconnect the power from the refrigerator and remove the panel at the back of the freezer compartment (from the inside) to see the evaporator unit and the fan.
If the fan is covered in ice there is a defrost problem.
This could be due to a faulty defrost heater,  a blocked drain between the freezer compartment and the evaporator pan under the compartments or a faulty control board.
If there is no ice build up at all, reconnect the power to the refrigerator and then manually operate the door switch located in the door jamb. The light in the compartment should go out and the evaporator fan should start to operate. If it doesn’t operate then either the fan is faulty or there is a problem with the power circuit to the fan

Bit confused here. Are you asking about the evaporator fan not running or the compressor motor not running?
If the compressor motor is running then the evaporator fan in the freezer compartment should be running.
The evaporator fan will NOT operate when a door is open (either door) so try manually operating the door switch (in the door jamb) with the door open when the compressor is running. The light should turn off and the fan should turn on again.
When it goes into the defrost mode the compressor and the evaporator fan are BOTH turned off and the defrost heater is turned on. When the temp in the freezer compartment reaches ~30 deg.F the defrost thermostat operates to signal the control board to turn the heater off and to restart the compressor and turn on the evaporator fan.
If the compressor is not running after a defrost cycle has ended or when it has to after it has been stopped due to the set temps having been reached and then have risen again etc,  it may be the start relay  -part #733 Sealed system and motherboard parts diagram more then the run capacitor as the compressor is "running" when it works it may just not be "starting" when it has to.
If the evaporator fan is not running after a defrost cycle etc then the fan or the fan power circuit from the control board needs to be checked.
If they are both OK it may be the control board.
