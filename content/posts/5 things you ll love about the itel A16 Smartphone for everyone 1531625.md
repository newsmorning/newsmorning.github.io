The itel A16 is the latest Android smartphone from itel Mobile. It is arguably one of the most affordable Android smartphones you can buy right now. However, the A16’s affordability doesn’t compromise functionality, at least not that much and itel continues to deliver its promise of “Android for Everyone” with this one.
 
Just to clear the air, the itel A16 will not replace your flagship device that comes with iris scanners and pop up cameras. What you are sure of getting is a fully functional Android device in the itel A16 package without selling an arm and leg.
 
We unboxed the A16 and shared our first impressions. After spending some waking hours in the company of this Android Go device, we put together a concrete review of the itel A16. It is amazing how a dirt-low priced package like this can deliver a great Android experience to the price-conscious consumers. Here are five things you will love about the itel A16.
 
## 1. 12 Month Warrant with Carlcare
 
After sales and
customer support have been one of the reasons why Transsion companies of itel,
Tecno and Infinix are winning in Africa. When you buy the itel A16, you get
free professional full service in case of any software issues for a full year.
This puts the A16 device apart from the pack as high end smartphones don’t have
designated repair places and you end up with third party mechanics that charge
crazy high prices. But with Carlcare, you will still get your itel A16 fixed affordably
even after expiry of warranty.
 
## 2. Android Go.
 
By now, you
probably know what Android Go is. It is a toned down and refined version of
Android OS to make it smooth on low end devices. The itel A16 comes with
Android Go and this improves usability. It is in rare cases that you notice a
lag even with just 512MB of RAM. Also, the reimagined version of Googles Apps
means you will enjoy more out of the A16. YouTube Go is a master of saving data
when streaming videos as it provides you with a range of options and you can
also download videos for offline viewing. Other apps like Gmail Go (for
emails), Maps Go (for getting around) and among others also add to an enjoyable
experience.
 
## 3. Low price.
 
The itel A16 is
one of the most affordable phones in Uganda right now with respectable specs.
At UGX 180,000 you will find it hard to find a device better than the itel A16.
This makes it affordable to students, low income earners that need a smartphone
that will connect them to the broader world of the internet. The low price
doesn’t compromise the smartphone experience a lot. You still get descent specs
with the itel A16.
 
## 4. Dual SIM, Quad core processor and Expandable storage.
 
The itel A16
comes with dual SIM functionality with dedicated slots. This means you can have
two SIM cards installed in your device and enjoy two telecom services or have
one SIM card for work and the other for work. Even the mighty iPhone X can’t
give you this (don’t hate iPhone guy). The A16 comes with a quad core processor
that keeps things running smoothly. The other good thing is the ability to
expand the storage via a microSD card. This means you will create more space to
put your files and WhatsApp images and videos giving it a lead over other
devices that don’t have expandable storage.
 
## 5. Free accessories
 
The itel retail
box is a one stop to get your smartphone life started. It comes with a screen
protector that adds a bit of fortification for the screen and prevents
scratches that maybe created by keys or coins. Itel also provides a plastic phone
cover with the itel A16. While some manufacturers don’t provide headsets in the
retail box, the itel A16 comes with a pair of bundled headsets included in the
box. Although these are not of the best quality, we are glad that they are
there in the first place.
 
There is more to love about the
itel A16 especially when you consider its price. It is a good phone for senior
citizens, students, first time smartphone buyers. It can also be a good kid’s
phone to run some light weight kids games to keep the kids engaged without investing
a lot. It also makes for a good second phone that can do all the day to day android
business without much hassle.
