# You Won't Believe It! The Home Button on Your iPhone 6 is Faulty...But Don't Panic! Touch ID Still Works Like a Charm!

If you're one of the millions of iPhone 6 users out there, you may have recently discovered an issue with your device's home button. The button might no longer be responding as well as it used to, or it may not be functioning at all. This can be a frustrating problem, as the home button is a key feature of the iPhone's user interface.

But don't panic just yet! Even if your iPhone 6's home button is faulty, there's still one feature that works like a charm: Touch ID.

For those who are unfamiliar, Touch ID is the biometric authentication system that Apple introduced with the iPhone 5S. It allows users to unlock their device and authorize purchases with just a touch of their finger. The feature has since been included on a number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 6.

Here's the good news: even if your home button is faulty, Touch ID should still be working just fine. That's because the Touch ID sensor is actually separate from the home button itself. In fact, it's located on the front of the device, rather than on the button itself.

So even if your home button isn't responding, you can still use Touch ID to unlock your phone, authorize purchases on iTunes and the App Store, and even log in to your banking apps (if they support Touch ID).

Of course, you may still want to get your home button fixed at some point. Having a faulty home button can be a major inconvenience, and it can make it difficult to navigate your device's interface. But if you're not ready to take on the expense of getting it fixed just yet, you can still use your iPhone 6 with confidence, knowing that Touch ID is still there to help you get things done.

In conclusion, while having a faulty home button on your iPhone 6 can be a bummer, you shouldn't let it ruin your day. Touch ID is still a reliable, convenient feature that can help you use your device with ease. So don't panic! You've still got plenty of options for using your iPhone 6, even if your home button isn't working quite right.

## Chosen Solution
 Home button is faulty, More often doesn’t work, but Touch ID does. I tried changing the screen, completely, flex cables as well, but nothing. Tried with a new home button, same issue. Don’t know anymore what to try to make it work. Ideas?

 From what I can gather is that the fingerprint circuit is all okay. That tells me your menu key connection is faulty. There is not a lot on that circuit and I would suspect either a faulty connector or a nudged component. There is one diode and one resistor sitting close to the connector if one has been accidently pried it would result in the “no return function”
 You will need a multimeter to test them. Test in continuity mode first then check OHM’s mode across the resistor with a known good board.

 Sounds like a torn home button flex. No much you can do but replace the button and lose Touch ID and keep home button functionaly.
