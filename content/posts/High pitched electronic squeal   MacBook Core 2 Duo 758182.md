Is Your Macbook Core 2 Duo Under Attack? Here's the One Thing You Need to Know About That Unbearable Electronic Squeal!

If you own a Macbook Core 2 Duo, you may have noticed an electronic squeal emanating from your laptop. This sound is not only annoying, but it may signify a serious issue with your machine. In this article, we will explore what causes the squeal and what you can do about it.

The infamous electronic squeal has been a source of frustration for many Macbook users over the years. It's a high-pitched sound that can be heard even when your Macbook is not in use. The squeal is caused by the motherboard's voltage regulators, which generate an electromagnetic field that interacts with other components on the board.

The good news is that the squeal is not harmful to your Macbook, and it does not impact the performance of your computer. However, the bad news is that the squeal can be quite annoying, especially when you need to work in a quiet environment.

So, what can you do about the squeal? The answer is actually quite simple: you can try to reduce the amount of electromagnetic interference around your Macbook. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. Move your Macbook away from other electronic devices. This includes routers, modems, speakers, and even other laptops. The closer your Macbook is to these devices, the more likely it is to pick up their electromagnetic radiation.

2. Use shielded cables for all your peripherals. Shielded cables have a protective coating that helps block electromagnetic radiation. This can reduce interference with your Macbook's components.

3. Use a surge protector. A surge protector not only protects your Macbook from power surges, but it can also help reduce the amount of electromagnetic interference that your Macbook is exposed to.

4. Update your Macbook's firmware. Apple has released firmware updates in the past that address the electronic squeal issue. Check for updates in your System Preferences and install any that are available.

In conclusion, the electronic squeal on your Macbook Core 2 Duo is not a serious issue and does not impact your computer's performance. However, it can be quite annoying, especially when you need to work in a quiet environment. By reducing the amount of electromagnetic interference around your Macbook, you can reduce or even eliminate the squeal. Follow the tips outlined above to help protect your Macbook and make your work environment more pleasant.

## Chosen Solution
 Over the past few weeks, I’ve noticed that my MacBook Core 2 Duo has developed a high-pitched squealing noise. It almost sounds like a high pitched record scratch with a variable frequency. It sounds like it’s coming from the back right side of the machine, near the power button and right side speaker. It seems if I tap the case hard enough in this area, it will temporarily stop, but it comes back fairly soon. It will also go for quite long periods without making the noise.
Volume controls and mute don’t affect the noise at all, and it will happen whether or not headphones are plugged in. Music and other audio plays out of both speaker and headphones with no issues. Performance and functionality of the machine don’t seem to be affected.
This is a pretty old machine that I’ve taken apart and put back together a TON of times for various reasons (fan, display inverter, LCD, bezel, keyboard/trackpad cable, hard drive, etc), so I wouldn’t be surprised if some other component has started to go bad.
My first impulse was going to be disconnecting the speakers to see if the sound would go away, but I thought I’d get input from the folks here first. Thanks!

 If not what Dylan said, it could be a loose internal fan, hitting the sides. Or even dust blocking it.

 It could be coil wine, look up a video to hear what coil whine sounds like.

 Does the sound change if you insert a disc into the optical drive? That is a noisy component which spins and is located near the area you are describing. If so you may have a faulty optical drive.
