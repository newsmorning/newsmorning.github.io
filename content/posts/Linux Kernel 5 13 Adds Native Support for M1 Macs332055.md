Linux enthusiasts and developers have always been ahead of the curve when it comes to innovation and technological advancements. The latest Linux Kernel 5.13 is no exception, as it introduces a game-changing update with native M1 Mac support.

Before the release of the latest kernel update, M1 Mac users had to rely on various workarounds to run Linux on their devices. These workarounds included virtual machines, containerized solutions, and emulation techniques. However, with the release of the 5.13 kernel, M1 Mac users can now enjoy the full potential of Linux, natively.

This breakthrough update is a significant milestone in the Linux community as it paves the way for more M1 Mac users to explore and experience Linux without the need for additional software or hardware. Because the support is now native, users can benefit from faster and more efficient performance compared to previous solutions.

M1 Mac users can now install popular Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux seamlessly. Because the platform is now supported natively, users can also easily utilize a wide range of Linux applications and tools available.

In addition to M1 Mac support, the latest kernel update also introduces many other essential features and enhancements. This includes improved security measures, new drivers, and additional support for various hardware.

One notable feature is the introduction of Landlock, a new sandboxing tool that provides Linux users with additional security measures. This feature promotes additional security for users while enhancing their privacy and protection from malicious software.

The 5.13 kernel update also includes support for a high-performance exFAT file system. This feature allows for faster data transfers and improved compatibility with external storage devices.

Finally, the new kernel update provides additional optimizations for gaming performance. This is a welcome feature, given that gaming on Linux has always been notoriously challenging. These optimizations are expected to improve frame rates, reduce input lag, and improve overall performance.

In conclusion, the release of Linux Kernel 5.13 introduces revolutionary updates that will undoubtedly enhance the Linux experience for M1 Mac users. The native M1 Mac support is a significant milestone in the Linux community and opens up doors for wider adoption of Linux on M1 devices. Additionally, the kernel update provides essential features and optimizations that improve security, performance, and compatibility. As we look to the future, it is exciting to see what further innovations the Linux community has in store.



After several months of development, Linux is finally available natively on M1 Macs.

 

Linus Torvalds announced on Sunday that the latest version of Linux, Kernel 5.13, is launching with native support for Apple M1. 9To5Google notes that Linux has been testing a release candidate version for the past month, but now the official release finally has arrived, bringing early levels of support. 

 

At the moment, it doesn’t appear that Linux Kernel 5.13 supports accelerated graphics, so there are still some advancements to be made in future updates. Torvalds says that, overall, 5.13 feels like a small update, however, it also happens to be one of the biggest 5.x releases, with over 16,000 commits (17,000, if you include merges).

 

The kernel also was developed with work from over 2,000 developers. Torvalds noted the extra size could have come from the additional release candidate week that 5.12 received. 

 

Either way, 5.13 is now available, and bringing native support for Linux is a big win for developers running M1 machines.

 

Previously, you could run Linux on M1 Macs using a virtual machine, as well as a Corellium port. Unfortunately, though, these versions didn’t take full advantage of everything the M1 has to offer. Now, with native support, users are closer to unlocking the full potential of the M1 in Linux. 

 

9To5Google says Linux should now work natively on the new M1 MacNook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and the 24-inch iMac. Security features included in 5.13 include Clang CFI support and Landlocked LSM, as well as the option to enable randomizing the kernel stack offset with each system call. FreeSync HDMI support is also included in the update.

 
With native support, users are closer to unlocking the full potential of the M1 in Linux.
 

With 5.13 out the door, Torvalds says that work on 5.14 has begun, which means M1 Mac users can expect even better support in the future.
