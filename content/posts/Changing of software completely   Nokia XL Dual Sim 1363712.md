## Chosen Solution
 I want to replace my XL Dual software completely, i am not getting any help from the market , do you have any service center or customer care center for Nokia in Karachi

 You can't change on a "completely" different software.
Your phone will have ONLY the Version and the O/S from the company.
If you mean to update your device ROM ,that's a completely different thing to do.
