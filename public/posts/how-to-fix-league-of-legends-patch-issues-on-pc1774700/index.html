Each new update fixes a certain amount of bugs, and brings occasional new features and gameplay elements. Therefore, it’s mandatory to install every patch, if you want to have the best possible experience.\nDownload Restoro PC Repair Tool that comes with Patented Technologies (patent available here).\nClick Start Scan to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems.\nClick Repair All to fix issues affecting your computer’s security and performance\nRestoro has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.\nHowever, patching League of Legends doesn’t always go as smooth as we might hope. In fact, various errors may occur, and if we don’t resolve them, we may end up with an outdated game. We’we searched for a couple of scenarios, including connection errors, not seeing the patcher, and more.\nWe’we searched for a couple of scenarios, including connection errors, not seeing the patcher, and more. And we’ve prepared a couple of solutions that might come in handy when dealing with League of Legends patching issues. So, if you have the patching problem, make sure to read this article.\nHow to solve League of Legends patching issues 1. Change screen refresh rate There’s a chance you legitimately received a patch, but you can’t see it because your monitor uses a wrong screen refresh rate. In this case, your monitor simply won’t show the patcher, and you won’t be able to download the update.\nTo change your screen refresh rate, do the following:\nRight-click on your Desktop Click the Display settings icon Click the Advanced Settings link, and then Display adapter properties Click the Monitor tab In the Monitor Settings box, change your Screen Refresh Rate Change your Screen Refresh Rate to 59hz or 60hz (most monitors support this mode) Click Apply Re-launch League of Legends 2. Reset Winsock League of Legends patcher is designed to work with the default TCP/IP settings. So, if your settings are different, the patcher might not work correctly. Winstock defines how a Windows network accesses TCP/IP services function, so resetting this feature will automatically reset the TCP/IP settings, as well. In order to reset winsock, follow these instructions:\nRight-click the Start Menu, and choose Command Prompt (Admin) Enter the following command, and press Enter: netsh winsock reset Restart your computer Launch League of Legends, and try to patch it again. If the wrong TCP/IP settings were the reason for the patcher not to work, everything should be fine now. However, if the problem still persists, you should move on to another solution.\n3. Run the game as Admin The patcher needs to have Administrator privileges in order to function correctly. So, running the game as Admin might resolve the problem.\nTo run League of Legends as admin, right click the game icon on Desktop, and choose Run as administrator.\n4. Force Re-Patch If nothing from above helped, you might try to ‘use the force’. Some game files might become corrupt occasionally, and that’s exactly what prevents the patcher from downloading updates correctly. The solution for this is to force a re-patch.\nTo force a re-patch, do the following:\nGo to your Riot Games folder (Default path: C:/Riot Games/League of Legends) Open the following directory: C:Riot GamesLeague of LegendsRADSprojectslol_air_clientreleases{highest version number} Delete the following files: – releasemanifest – S_OK Open the Deploy folder Delete the following folders/files: – lib (folder) – META-INF (folder) – mod (folder) – lolclient.exe (file) – lolclient.swf (file) – locale.properties (file) Restart League of Legends 5. Repair game files Speaking of corrupt files that prevent the patcher from working normally, there one more thing you can do to make things right. You can repair game files using League of Legends’ own repair tool. Here’s exactly what you need to do:\nC:Riot GamesLeague of LegendsRADSprojectslol_air_clientreleases{highest version number}\n– releasemanifest\n– S_OK\n– lib (folder)\n– META-INF (folder)\n– mod (folder)\n– lolclient.exe (file)\n– lolclient.swf (file)\n– locale.properties (file)\nRun League of Legends\nClick on the ‘?’ button that is located in the top right corner of the window\nClick Repair\nWait. The repair function can take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 30 depending on the number of corrupt files it has to repair\nNow, restart League of Legends, and try to update the game again.\n6. Disable UAC Windows’ User Account Control (UAC) is a security measure that actually can prevent legit apps, programs, and updates from installing. That’s exactly the reason why the majority of users disable it as soon as they install the fresh system (although it’s not advised).\nSome PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.\nExpert tip:\nSPONSORED\nUAC can also prevent LoL updates from installing, so if none of the previously listed solutions worked, you can try with disabling this feature. To disable UAC in Windows, do the following:\nGo to Search, type uac, and open Change User Account Control settings Set the scan to Never notify, and press OK Restart your computer Now, try to update League of Legends with UAC disabled. If you’ve managed to download the update, it’s advised to bring UAC to previous settings after.\n7. Disable your Firewall Windows Firewall is another security measure that can prevent you from installing new apps and updates. So, we’re going to try to disable it, and see if the patcher works then. Here’s what you need to do:\nGo to Search, type firewall and open Windows Firewall Now, click on Turn Windows Firewall off or on Go to Turn off Windows Firewall However, if you determine that Windows Firewall actually didn’t the patching problems, it is recommended to have it back on. Although it can be annoying sometimes, Windows Firewall is a very useful feature, and it helps your computer running safe.\n8. Make sure .NET Framework 3.5 is installed League of Legends requires .NET Framework 3.5 to be installed on your computer. So, if you don’t have this feature, various issues may occur. Make sure you have .NET Framework 3.5 installed on your computer, and download it from this link if not.\nRemember, even if you have .NET Framework 4.0, .NET Framework 3.5 is still required.\n9. Disable your antivirus and firewall software Sometimes, your antivirus may interfere with online gaming activities. This might explain why you can’t update League of Legends update or you can’t launch the game shortly after installing the update. Your security software may block the connection to the LoL game servers.\nAs a workaround, you can disable your antivirus before launching League of Legends, and then run hit the update button.\nAs always, don’t forget to enable your antivirus and firewall once you’ve solve the problem to make sure your PC is fully protected.\n10. Make sure your internet connection is working properly And finally, if your internet connection doesn’t work properly, you won’t be even able to run the game, let alone updating it. So, make sure everything is okay with your internet connection and router.

The solution for this is to force  a re-patch.</p><p>To force a re-patch, do the following:</p><ul><li>Go to your Riot Games folder (Default path: C:/Riot Games/League of Legends)</li><li>Open the following directory:</li><li>C:Riot GamesLeague of LegendsRADSprojectslol_air_clientreleases{highest version number}</li><li>Delete the following files:</li><li>– releasemanifest</li><li>– S_OK</li><li>Open the Deploy folder</li><li>Delete the following folders/files:</li><li>– lib (folder)</li><li>– META-INF (folder)</li><li>– mod (folder)</li><li>– lolclient.exe (file)</li><li>– lolclient.swf (file)</li><li>– locale.properties (file)</li><li>Restart League of Legends</li></ul><h3 id=5-repair-game-files>5. Repair game files<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-repair-game-files>#</a></h3><p>Speaking of corrupt files that prevent the patcher from working normally, there one more thing you can do to make things right. You can repair game files using League of Legends’ own repair tool. Here’s exactly what you need to do:</p><ul><li><p>C:Riot GamesLeague of LegendsRADSprojectslol_air_clientreleases{highest version number}</p></li><li><p>– releasemanifest</p></li><li><p>– S_OK</p></li><li><p>– lib (folder)</p></li><li><p>– META-INF (folder)</p></li><li><p>– mod (folder)</p></li><li><p>– lolclient.exe (file)</p></li><li><p>– lolclient.swf (file)</p></li><li><p>– locale.properties (file)</p></li><li><p>Run League of Legends</p></li><li><p>Click on the ‘?’ button that is located in the top right corner of the window</p></li><li><p>Click Repair</p></li><li><p>Wait. The repair function can take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 30 depending on the number of corrupt files it has to repair</p></li></ul><p>Now, restart League of Legends, and try to update the game again.</p><h3 id=6-disable-uac>6. Disable UAC<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-disable-uac>#</a></h3><p>Windows’ User Account Control (UAC) is a security measure that actually can prevent legit apps, programs, and updates from installing. That’s exactly the reason why the majority of users disable it as soon as they install the fresh system (although it’s not advised).</p><p>Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.</p><p>Expert tip:</p><p>SPONSORED</p><p>UAC can also prevent LoL updates from installing, so if none of the previously listed solutions worked, you can try with disabling this feature. To disable UAC in Windows, do the following:</p><ul><li>Go to Search, type uac, and open Change User Account Control settings</li><li>Set the scan to Never notify, and press OK</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p>Now, try to update League of Legends with UAC disabled. If you’ve managed to download the update, it’s advised to bring UAC to previous settings after.</p><h3 id=7-disable-your-firewall>7. Disable your Firewall<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-disable-your-firewall>#</a></h3><p>Windows Firewall is another security measure that can prevent you from installing new apps and updates. So, we’re going to try to disable it, and see if the patcher works then. Here’s what you need to do:</p><ul><li>Go to Search, type firewall and open Windows Firewall</li><li>Now, click on Turn Windows Firewall off or on</li><li>Go to Turn off Windows Firewall</li></ul><p>However, if you determine that Windows Firewall actually didn’t the patching problems, it is recommended to have it back on. Although it can be annoying sometimes, Windows Firewall is a very useful feature, and it helps your computer running safe.</p><h3 id=8-make-sure-net-framework-35-is-installed>8. Make sure .NET Framework 3.5 is installed<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#8-make-sure-net-framework-35-is-installed>#</a></h3><p>League of Legends requires .NET Framework 3.5 to be installed on your computer. So, if you don’t have this feature, various issues may occur. Make sure you have .NET Framework 3.5 installed on your computer, and download it from this link if not.</p><p>Remember, even if you have .NET Framework 4.0, .NET Framework 3.5 is still required.</p><h3 id=9-disable-your-antivirus-and-firewall-software>9. Disable your antivirus and firewall software<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#9-disable-your-antivirus-and-firewall-software>#</a></h3><p>Sometimes, your antivirus may interfere with online gaming activities. This might explain why you can’t update League of Legends update or you can’t launch the game shortly after installing the update. Your security software may block the connection to the LoL game servers.</p><p>As a workaround, you can disable your antivirus before launching League of Legends, and then run hit the update button.</p><p>As always, don’t forget to enable your antivirus and firewall once you’ve solve the problem to make sure your PC is fully protected.</p><h3 id=10-make-sure-your-internet-connection-is-working-properly>10. Make sure your internet connection is working properly<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#10-make-sure-your-internet-connection-is-working-properly>#</a></h3><p>And finally, if your internet connection doesn’t work properly, you won’t be even able to run the game, let alone updating it. So, make sure everything is okay with your internet connection and router.
