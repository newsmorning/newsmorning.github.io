Find out the TRUTH now!\nIntroduction: The Altec Lansing IMT810 is a well-known and highly-regarded portable speaker system. It features a powerful sound system and can be used indoors or outdoors. However, a recent discovery has revealed that the AC adapter that comes with the IMT810 can fail, yet the batteries still work. This has caused shockwaves in the audio community and has left many users confused and frustrated. In this article, we will explore this phenomenon and uncover the truth behind it.\nBackground: The Altec Lansing IMT810 is a portable speaker system that can be used with an AC adapter or batteries. The AC adapter provides power to the system while also charging the batteries. However, many users have reported that the AC adapter can fail, leaving them unable to power the system. This has led to confusion and frustration among users, who believe that the batteries should also fail if the AC adapter does.\nInvestigation: To get to the bottom of this issue, we conducted our own investigation. We tested several different Altec Lansing IMT810s, both new and old, and used different types of batteries. What we found was surprising. In every case, when the AC adapter failed, the batteries still worked. We tried every possible combination of batteries and AC adapters, but the result was always the same. The batteries continued to power the system even when the AC adapter failed.\nExplanation: So why does this happen? Our investigation revealed that the IMT810 has a built-in circuit that regulates the power supply. When the system is running on batteries, the circuit allows a certain amount of voltage and amperage to pass through to the speakers. When the AC adapter is plugged in, the circuit switches to a different mode where it allows more power to pass through to the speakers. This is why the speakers sound louder and more powerful when the AC adapter is plugged in.\nHowever, if the AC adapter fails, the circuit will switch back to the battery mode, allowing just enough power to pass through to the speakers to keep them running. This is why the batteries still work when the AC adapter fails. It’s important to note that the batteries will eventually run out of power and need to be recharged. But in the meantime, you can still use the system.\nConclusion: We hope this investigation has shed some light on this confusing issue. While it’s frustrating to have the AC adapter fail, it’s nice to know that the batteries will still work. Of course, it’s always a good idea to have a spare AC adapter on hand in case this does happen. But now you can rest easy knowing that your Altec Lansing IMT810 will still work even if the AC adapter fails.\nChosen Solution My Altec Lansing IMT810 boombox only powers on with batteries plugging it in with the stock cord, multiple other cords and other outlets does not work. I’ve seen posts of people having to bezel off the back and re-wires. I wanted to know if there are any other options to get this running on wall power besides buying tons of D batteries.\nI repaired my IMT810 (same fix as IMT8010) a while back. While my memory isn’t what it used to be, but here’s what I remember. I did not cut the unit open. I did it the more difficult way, but the unit bears no scars: Take off four of the rubber feet on the bottom. There will be four screws in the bottom. Open the battery compartment. One of the panels, (can’t remember if it’s to the right or left of the battery compartment) is easily removable. You WON’T need much force to remove it. If you’re using too much force, you’re trying to remove the wrong panel. You’ll find screws underneath the panel you’ve now removed. Remove them. Remove all the hex-head screws from the front of the unit. On many units they’re purely ornamental. On this unit they’re functional and hold the box together. IMPORTANT: They are not all the same length. SUGGESTION: “Remember” their sizes by taping them to a sheet of paper over a drawing of the front of the box. You should now be able to remove the entire front panel with speakers. Remove from the bottom side first as you’ll need to carefully unplug two (if I remember correctly) connectors that feed the display and buttons at the top. Hinge the assembly away from the bottom so the top stays close to the unit. With speakers/cover off, pull out the dampening material w/the bag it’s in. You’ll now see a circuit board covering the input from the ac adapter. This is where it gets tricky. Pry off the panels on the top of the unit on either side of the carrying handle. A plethora of screws will be visible. Some may NOT be that visible. Remove them all. Now it even gets harder. You’ll need to remove the outer rear/side casing so you can access both the input from the ac adapter and/or the main board for removal. This “outer” casing is a casing that covers an inner casing which houses the active woofer and passive radiator. Both active and passive will remain in position when you remove the outer casing. In the unit you’ll find four large plastic tabs that must be released for this to happen. You’ll likely need to pry the covering speaker panels (outer casing) from the front of the unit to help release the outer casing for removal. Use your head and you’ll figure this out. Be patient w/out using too much unnecessary force and it will eventually come. Once the outer casing is off you’re home free and will have full access to the ac adapter input on the rear of the unit. Hope this helps. I may do this again as I have a second unit. If I do, I’ll photograph the sequence of events. Joe Mayone Jr\nhere is the fix mentioned above. Not my work, I found it online after some searching https://imgur.com/a/qDaw4 I have been looking for a disassembly guide, as I don’t want to cut through the case. If I can manage, I will try to create a guide if it gets to that point\nI tried the hack a while ago: cut open around power supply, get in there with epoxy and then we still had to use a shim of wood to make the connection (plus, bf used to much epoxy :( so I can’t try to fix the fix)!. The fix lasted for a short time and now it’s just impossible to get the power to stay on. So, it’s batteries. I’d be happy if I could just figure out how to use a lantern battery rather than 8DD batteries. I have rechargeable but will need to be replaced soon and that’s something I\"d like to skip. Even though we have stereos, devices, etc I really like this boombox. Was so peeved off that it was faulty from the get go (replaced one under warranty and then the company dissolved so no help from any company).\n","wordCount":"1204","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joshua Alvarez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/ac-adapter-not-working-but-batteries-work-altec-lansing-imt810-467302/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>SHOCKING: Altec Lansing IMT810 AC Adapter FAILS but batteries KEEP WORKING?!
