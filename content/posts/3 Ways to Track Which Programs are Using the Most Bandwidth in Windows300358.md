Title: Is Your Internet Sluggish? Check Out These 3 Simple Tips To Track Down Bandwidth Hogs on Windows

Are you tired of experiencing slow internet speeds? Do you feel like no matter how much you try, you cannot seem to resolve the issue? Well, the problem may not be with your internet service provider or your computer. It could be that there are bandwidth hogs on your windows system that are using up your internet connection. 

Bandwidth hogs are high-bandwidth-consuming applications, services or devices that utilize your internet connection to download or transfer large files, videos, and data. These bandwidth hogs can also be running in the background, unbeknownst to you, and slowing down your internet experience. If you use a Windows operating system and want to eliminate this problem, here are three simple tips to help you track down bandwidth hogs on Windows.

1. Use the Task Manager
The Task Manager is an in-built utility that comes with Windows operating systems. It shows you a list of all running processes and allows you to monitor their usage. To launch Task Manager, press CTRL + SHIFT + ESC on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can right-click on the taskbar and select ‘Task Manager.”

Once the Task Manager is open, go to the “Processes” tab, and click on the “Network” column to sort the running processes by network usage. You can then identify which processes are consuming the most bandwidth and close them if necessary.

2. Use Resource Monitor
Resource Monitor is another in-built utility that comes with Windows operating systems. It provides more detailed information compared to the Task Manager, showing you real-time graphs and data for CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network usage. You can also use Resource Monitor to track down bandwidth-hogging apps.

To launch Resource Monitor, press Windows Key + R on your keyboard, then type “resmon” in the Run dialog box and press Enter. Once the Resource Monitor is open, select the “Network” tab to view which processes are hogging your bandwidth. You can then click on the process to see its details and decide whether to terminate it or not.

3. Use Third-Party Bandwidth-Monitoring Apps
Lastly, you can use third-party bandwidth-monitoring apps that are specifically designed to track down bandwidth hogs. These apps provide more detailed information and can help you quickly identify the culprit. Popular options include NetBalancer, GlassWire, and NetWorx.

After installing a bandwidth-monitoring app, launch it and review the real-time data. You can then sort the data by the highest usage and identify which applications or services are using your bandwidth. You can then take action to limit or disable these bandwidth hogs.

In conclusion, sluggish internet speeds can be frustrating, but tracking down bandwidth hogs can be easy when you follow the tips mentioned above. By using the built-in utilities like Task Manager and Resource Monitor or third-party apps, you can quickly identify and eliminate bandwidth hogs, improving your internet experience.

Are you having
trouble connecting to Facebook or Twitter? Has your internet connection slowed
down to the point that it’s become unusable?
 
Don’t blame your
internet service provider just yet. The reason for this could be a program
consuming bandwidth in the background. 
 
In this post,
you’ll learn how to monitor the bandwidth usage of your applications and how to
put an end to it.
 

 
## Method
1: Task Manager
 
The easiest way
to monitor your network activity would be through Task Manager. This application shows all the programs that are
currently running in your PC. This feature is available on Windows 7, Windows
8, and Windows 10.
 
Open Task Manager
by hitting Ctrl + Shift + Esc. You can also right-click Start
and select Task Manager.
 
For most users,
the Task Manager will only display programs that are currently running. Click More Details to get more information.
 
The expanded view
will not only show a list of running applications, but it also tells which are
consuming the most resources — including network activity.
 
Clicking Network will arrange the column in
ascending or descending order. Putting the list in descending order lets you
see which programs are getting the most network usage.
 
To can force
applications to stop. Right-click the program and select End Task.
 
Note: Some running applications
are crucial for Windows to continue working. Ending these types of tasks will
cause your computer to shut down.
 
## Method
2: Resource Monitor
 
You can use Resource Monitor instead to find which
apps are connecting to the internet. Resource Monitor is the better tool to use
if you want to dive deeper into the details.
 
Open Run and type RESMON. Windows 8 users might have to type RESMON.EXE instead. 
 
This will open
Resource Monitor. Click the Network tab. This will show you all the network
activity on your computer.
 
The Processes With Network Activity window
is composed of five columns. 
 
- Image – The name of the applicationPID – Shows you the process ID numberSend (B/sec) – This is the average number of
 - bytes per second the app sent in the last minute.Receive (B/Sec) – This is the average number
 - of bytes per second the app received in the last minute.Total (B/Sec) – Total bytes per second the app
 - used in the last minute.

 
If you’re seeing
unfamiliar programs in the list, right-click on it and select Search Online. 
 
Clicking Search
Online will prompt Windows to do a web search of the application in question.
 
Should you find
an application that’s using way too much bandwidth, right-click it and select End Process.
 
## Method
3: Third-Party Tools
 
You can find a
number of third-party programs online to help monitor your bandwidth usage.
This is great for students or anyone who has a cap on internet usage.
 
While these apps
give you more control over your bandwidth allocation, they can be pricey. Most
of them aren’t free while others operate on a freemium model.
 
But still, if
monitoring network usage is important to you then it could be worth spending
money on a solution.
