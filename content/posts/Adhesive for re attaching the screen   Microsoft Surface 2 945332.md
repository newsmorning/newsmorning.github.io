You Won't Believe This One Simple Trick to Fix Your Broken Microsoft Surface 2 Screen - Try This Game-Changing Adhesive Now!

Are you tired of dealing with a broken Microsoft Surface 2 screen? Are you looking for an easy and affordable way to fix it? Look no further than this game-changing adhesive that will have your device looking as good as new in no time.

The adhesive in question is called LOCA, which stands for Liquid Optically Clear Adhesive. Unlike traditional adhesives, LOCA is specifically designed for use in electronic devices and is commonly used in the repair of phone and tablet screens.

Here's how it works: When you apply LOCA to the surface of your Microsoft Surface 2 screen, it fills in any cracks or gaps, creating a seamless surface. Once the adhesive is in place, it is cured using a UV light, which essentially cements the broken pieces back together.

Not only is LOCA easy to use, but it also produces impressive results. Unlike other adhesives, it doesn't leave behind any bubbles or streaks, and it dries clear, so you won't even be able to tell that your screen was ever broken.

While LOCA is commonly used in phone and tablet repairs, it is also a great option for repairing a Microsoft Surface 2 screen. This device is known for being difficult to repair, but with LOCA, the process is much simpler and less costly.

So why hasn't everyone heard of LOCA before? While it has been used in the repair industry for years, it's just now starting to gain popularity among consumers. If you're looking for a quick and easy fix for your broken Microsoft Surface 2 screen, LOCA is the answer.

In conclusion, if you're tired of dealing with a broken Microsoft Surface 2 screen, try using LOCA to fix it. It's an affordable and easy solution that will have your device looking as good as new in no time. Don't believe us? Give it a try for yourself and you'll see the game-changing results firsthand.

 @dimtim,Tim, You could try heating up the devices screen to hopefully reactivate the existing adhesive with heat gun or hair dryer and press down/clamp on effected area until cooled or remove display(link #1) and start by carefully removing any adhesive residue from the back casing and screen assy. with soft cloth dampened with 90% Isopropyl Alcohol and finger nail, etc. till surface is clean. Then position strips of 3M adhesive 2 sided tape in preparation for the new screen assembly. Reconnect the cables on the new assembly to the logic board, ensuring each connection clips securely in place, and then press the screen onto the 2 sided 3M adhesive tape. Links below may help. Good luck.
