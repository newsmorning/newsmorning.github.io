Ransomware is a malicious software that encrypts files on a computer system and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. Over the past few years, ransomware attacks have become increasingly common, affecting various institutions, including hospitals and schools. Recently, another variant of ransomware, Defray, has been causing havoc in these sectors.

Defray Ransomware Strikes Again!\nRansomware is a malicious software that encrypts files on a computer system and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key. Over the past few years, ransomware attacks have become increasingly common, affecting various institutions, including hospitals and schools. Recently, another variant of ransomware, Defray, has been causing havoc in these sectors.\nDefray is a targeted ransomware attack that specifically targets organizations in the healthcare and education sectors. The attackers behind Defray have been using phishing emails to target employees and spreading the malware through email attachments. Once the malware infects the system, it encrypts the data, renders it inaccessible, and displays a ransom note, demanding payment in Bitcoin.\nThe impact of ransomware attacks on schools and hospitals is significant. Schools rely heavily on their computer systems to run daily operations, including scheduling, resource management, and student data management. If they fall victim to a ransomware attack, they risk losing access to critical information, resulting in cancellations of important school activities and disruptions in the education process.\nSimilarly, hospitals hold sensitive patient data that hackers can exploit through ransomware attacks. A hospital unable to access patient data risks delayed diagnoses, incorrect treatments, and severe consequences. Plus, sensitive patient data can be sold on the black market, compromising the privacy of thousands of people.\nDefray ransomware attacks are a threat to these sectors, and it’s essential to take necessary measures to prevent or minimize the impact of these attacks. One critical step is to train employees to identify and report phishing emails, deleting any suspicious attachments. Additionally, these sectors should invest in robust cybersecurity measures, including network protection, data backup, and disaster recovery plans.\nIn conclusion, Defray ransomware is a significant threat to the education and healthcare sectors. The costs of fall victim to these attacks, from data loss to reputational damage, are enormous for schools and hospitals. Hence, it’s necessary to implement strict cybersecurity measures and ensure all staff is aware of the risks and how they can identify and report phishing emails to protect their organizations.\n“A single spear-phishing email carrying a slightly altered malware can bypass multi-million-dollar enterprise security solutions if an adversary deceives a cyber-hygienically apathetic employee into opening the attachment or clicking a malicious link and thereby compromising the entire network.”\nJames Scott, Senior Fellow, Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology\nLast week, a Ransomware called Defray targeting a selected group of elite organizations demanding $5,000 upon infection. It is a file encoder Trojan written in C++ which uses advanced cryptographic algorithm.\nMust Read: Various Ways To Protect Your PC Against Ransomware\nThe name Defray is based on the command-and-control server host in the first traced attack: ‘defrayable-listings’.\nIt is also known by another name Glushkov Ransomware. The name might be used as a reference to ‘[email protected],’ ‘glushkov®tutanota.de,’ and ‘[email protected]’ e mail accounts that are used to spread the threat and used to contact the hacker.\nIt was distributing two small and selective attacks and is recognized as great crypto threat. the threat is being likened to the Petya and WannaCry strains.\nAccording to reports, the threat is targeting mostly hospitals and educational institutions network and encrypting data.\nThe first attacks were aimed at healthcare and education organization, while the other targeted manufacturing and technology institutions.\nHow is it Spreading? Img src: gbhackers\nThe installer used to spread the malware is using a Word document which contains an embedded executable video clip (O LE packager shell object).\nWhen the recipient tries to play the embedded video, which is an image, Defray Ransomware gets installed and is activated. After installation, it starts encrypting data and then displays a ransom note, declaring that to regain access you must pay ransom.\nPhishing emails and targeted spear phishing emails are used to attract office employees and they are then forced to read the infected document. Emails are addressed to individuals or groups and it consists of messages specially designed to lure the targets.\nFirst time the campaign took place on Aug 15 targeting manufacturing and technology professionals. In continuation on Aug 22, another campaign was launched and fake mails were send to healthcare and educational organizations. This email contained patient report from a supposed Director of Information Management and Technology at a hospital.\nImg src: Proofpoint\nThese bogus emails give open invitation to the malware and it gets installed on machines.

This one doesn’t even have a name. It uses AES-256 for encrypting files, RSA-2048 for storing encrypted AES-256 password and SHA-2 for keeping the encrypted file integrity. It’s written in C++ and have passed many quality assurance tests. To prevent this next time use offline backups.”\nSource: tripwire\nDefray Ransomware encrypt files with the following extensions:\n.001, .3ds, .7zip, .MDF, .NRG, .PBF, .SQLITE, .SQLITE2, .SQLITE3, .SQLITEDB, .SVG, .UIF, .WMF, .abr, .accdb, .afi, .arw, .asm, .bkf, .c4d, .cab, .cbm, .cbu, .class, .cls, .cpp, .cr2, .crw, .csh, .csv, .dat, .dbx, .dcr, .dgn, .djvu, .dng, .doc, .docm, .docx, .dwfx, .dwg, .dxf, .exe, .fla, .fpx, .gdb, .gho, .ghs, .hdd, .html, .iso, .iv2i, .java, .key, .lcf, .lnk, .matlab, .max, .mdb, .mdi, .mrbak, .mrimg, .mrw, .nef, .odg, .ofx, .orf, .ova, .ovf, .pbd, .pcd, .pdf, .php, .pps, .ppsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pqi, .prn, .psb, .psd, .pst, .ptx, .pvm, .pzl, .qfx, .qif, .r00, .raf, .rar, .raw, .reg, .rw2, .s3db, .skp, .spf, .spi, .sql, .sqlite-journal, .stl, .sup, .swift, .tib, .txf, .u3d, .v2i, .vcd, .vcf, .vdi, .vhd, .vmdk, .vmem, .vmwarevm, .vmx, .vsdx, .wallet, .win, .xls, .xlsm, .xlsx, .zip.\nSource: enigmasoftware\nNext Read: Locky Ransomware ‘Back from the Dead’\nAll these ransomware attacks are an alarm to stay protected and aware.
