Shocking Truth Revealed: Emerson Le320Em3 TV Refuses To Turn On After Power Outage!

Emerson Le320Em3 TV was once a staple in many households. It's a sleek, stylish, and affordable LED TV that was advertised to be the perfect addition to any home theater setup. However, many users of Emerson Le320Em3 are currently experiencing a problem: their TV refuses to turn on after a power outage. In this article, we will explore the shocking truth behind this issue and provide possible solutions.

Like most electronic devices, Emerson Le320Em3 TV has a power-saving function that allows it to shut down automatically during a power outage. This feature is meant to protect the TV from electrical fluctuations and surges that may occur during power outages. However, once the power comes back on, some Emerson Le320Em3 TVs may not turn on immediately, leaving users frustrated and confused.

The first possible solution to this problem is to unplug the TV from the power source and wait for 10-15 minutes. This will allow the TV to reset and cool down, which may resolve the issue. After the waiting period, plug the TV back in and try turning it on again.

If unplugging the TV from the power source doesn't work, then the issue might be with the power supply board. This component distributes power to the TV's various components, and if it's damaged, the TV may not turn on. The power supply board can be repaired or replaced by a professional technician.

Another possible cause of this problem is a faulty remote control. In some cases, the TV may not turn on even after pressing the power button on the remote. This issue can be resolved by replacing the batteries in the remote or getting a new one.

Finally, software issues can also cause this problem. In some cases, the software may become corrupted, which may affect the TV's ability to turn on. This issue can be resolved by resetting the TV to its default factory settings. To do this, navigate to the "Setup" menu and select "Reset to Default."

In conclusion, the Emerson Le320Em3 TV refusing to turn on after a power outage is a common issue that can be resolved in various ways. Whether the issue is with the power supply board, remote control, or software, there are solutions available. By following the tips in this article, Emerson Le320Em3 TV users can get their device up and running in no time.


## Chosen Solution
 I have an Emerson 32" model # LE320EM3
Serial# DS1A122810Z669 that after a power outage will not come on. I checked the 4 amp 125 volt fuse and it was blown. Replaced the fuse and still nothing, no standby red light. I bought the TV from a friend and have no clue of it is a LCD, LED or what type of TV it is, there is no markings that say what it is. Any ideas???

 Try looking at the board for any capacitors that are bulging on the top or leaking on the top. Also look for any spots that look burnt or blackend. If all that is good, inspect each component closely to see if any of them are broken or burnt. Also smell the board (Weird I know) but you should be able to smell something burnt or odd smelling (Unless you can't smell) that should help give you an indicator of whats wrong.
Also, did you replace it with a 4A 125V Fuse? Or one with different values?
Hope this helps and good luck fixing!

 Replace the power board and you should be good to go.  They’re inexpensive and easy to find; check shopjimmy or eBay, for starters. I’ve had three of these Emerson models do the same thing to two different owners in the past few years but all were repaired for less than $40.
Best of luck!
