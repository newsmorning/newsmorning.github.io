For years, Google Maps has dominated the mobile mapping space. It’s been the go-to app for millions of people looking to find their way around cities or search for businesses. However, in recent years, Apple Maps has started to creep up in popularity, and that’s because it is outperforming Google Maps in every way possible.\nAccuracy One of the most critical factors in determining the quality of a mapping app is accuracy. Apple uses a combination of proprietary data, third-party sources, and user-generated data to create maps that are incredibly precise. Apple uses over 200 anonymous sources that send updates on road closures, construction, and other events that may affect driving routes. This data is analyzed to create accurate maps that are updated in real-time. Additionally, Apple uses 3D modeling and computer vision to provide a more accurate and realistic representation of buildings and points of interest.\nIn contrast, Google’s maps are based on satellite imagery and other data sources that may not be as precise. While Google has been working to improve its maps over the years, it still lags behind Apple in terms of accuracy.\nPrivacy Privacy is another area where Apple Maps outshines Google Maps. Apple is committed to protecting user privacy, and it has built privacy features into all of its products. Apple Maps uses what it calls “differential privacy” to protect user data. This means that location data is anonymized before it’s sent to Apple, so it cannot be traced back to an individual.\nIn contrast, Google collects a vast amount of data from users, including location data. Google uses this data for advertising and other purposes, which has raised concerns about user privacy.\nNavigation When it comes to navigation, Apple Maps is just as capable as Google Maps. Both apps offer turn-by-turn navigation, traffic updates, and point of interest searches. But Apple has added some features that make it a better navigation tool in some cases.\nFor example, Apple Maps includes lane guidance, which shows users which lane they should be in for upcoming turns or exits. Apple Maps also has a feature called “Flyover,” which allows users to see a 3D view of a location they’re navigating to. This can be helpful if you’re trying to get your bearings in a new city or locate an unfamiliar building.\nConclusion In conclusion, Apple Maps is outperforming Google Maps in every way possible. It is more accurate, protects user privacy, and offers navigation features that are just as good as Google’s, if not better. While Google Maps is still a useful app, it’s clear that Apple Maps is the superior mapping app for those who value accuracy, privacy, and advanced features. So, if you haven’t made the switch to Apple Maps yet, it’s time to give it a try!\nWhen it comes to navigation apps, Google maps is surely one of the first app that strikes our mind. Surprisingly, even most Apple users rely on Google Maps rather than picking the default navigation app offered by iOS. Initially, Apple Maps did have a rocky start and wasn’t much preferred as a go-to navigation app by users.\nBut over time developers surely invested a lot of time and efforts to update Apple Maps and now there’s nothing that it doesn’t offer. In fact, today we’re going to discuss five reasons why Apple maps can be a better choice than Google maps.\nSo, let’s discuss each one of em’ in detail.\n1. Flyover Mode We’re all aware of Google’s street view mode, right? It lets you experience panoramic views of various locations wherever you drop the pin. Similarly, Apple has also introduced something innovative, named as Flyover mode which allows you to take a 3D tour of the city like you’re actually flying over it. Flyover mode gives you a helicopter-ride kind of experience where in you can also pan in/out, tilt your phone and move around the map however you prefer. This is so far one of best feature offered by Apple Maps and is surely one of a kind experience. Currently, more than hundreds of cities are offering Flyover mode compatibility. Simply search a city and tap the “Flyover” button on the screen.\nAlso Read: How Google Maps Provide Traffic Updates\n2. 3D Navigation Google Maps satellite view is a huge perk while navigation. Similarly, Apple Maps now offers 3D navigation mode for a better view of the layout of the land as you make your way from point A to point B. To use 3D mode on Apple maps simply swipe up two fingers while you’re navigating.\n3. Uber and Lyft Google Maps work has a great integration with Uber, whereas Apple maps now offers both Uber and Lyft support. While taking a ride you can compare the rates of both apps and then make your selection.\nAlso Read: 10 Best Google Maps Alternatives\n4. Enhanced Airport Maps Agree or not, but Apple Maps surely does a great job when it comes to Airport maps. You can now find the nearest Starbucks or Costa and all the information you want in one go. You can also see Terminals, Check-in desks, Gates, Bag Claims, Food, Drinks, Shops and Restrooms.\n5. Better Weather Apps Apple Maps has taken weather updates to a whole new level. As we’re all aware Google Maps lists current weather conditions for cities and place, but with Apple Maps you’ll be able to view weather conditions of specific landmarks as well. Just tap the tiny icon the lower right corner of map screen. Also, when you press harder on the screen you’ll be able to view a nine-day weather forecast of a specific location.\nGuess it’s time to give Apple Maps a try, isn’t it? Here were the 5 reasons why Apple maps undoubtedly prove out to be better than Google Maps. So, what’s your pick?
