Our smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives, serving as personal assistants, cameras, and entertainment centers all in one. But did you know that there are several hidden features that can make your phone even more useful? In this article, we’ll explore 5 amazing features that you probably never knew existed on your smartphone.\n1. Screen Recording Have you ever wanted to record your screen to show someone how to use a particular feature, or to create a tutorial for your followers? Most iPhones and Android devices have an easy-to-use screen recording feature built-in. All you have to do is enable it in the Control Center or Quick Settings menu and press record. It’s that simple!\n2. Emergency SOS In case of an emergency or if you’re in a dangerous situation, your smartphone can be used to alert people and provide critical information to first responders, thanks to the Emergency SOS feature. On iPhone, simply press and hold the side button (or volume and power buttons on older models) and the SOS slider will appear, letting you make an emergency call or notify your emergency contacts. On Android, you can set up a shortcut to emergency services in your emergency information settings.\n3. Sleep Timer Are you someone who likes to listen to music or podcasts before bed? The Sleep Timer feature on most smartphones allows you to set a timer for your media player to automatically stop playing after a certain amount of time. This can help you fall asleep without having to worry about stopping playback manually or draining your battery.\n4. Wireless File Sharing Have you ever needed to quickly transfer files between devices without using the internet? Your smartphone can act as a wireless hotspot, allowing you to share files with other devices through Wi-Fi Direct. This feature is called “Nearby Share” on most Android devices and “AirDrop” on iPhones. Simply enable the feature and select the files you want to share – your phone will take care of the rest!\n5. Digital Wellbeing Feeling like you’re spending too much time on your phone? Digital Wellbeing is a feature that helps you manage your usage by providing insights into your phone habits and setting limits on apps and notifications. On iPhone, it’s called Screen Time, and on Android, it’s Digital Wellbeing. These features let you set daily limits, schedule downtime, and even block specific apps to help you strike a balance between screen time and real life.\nIn conclusion, these 5 amazing features are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hidden gems of your smartphone. Before you go searching for third-party apps or tools, be sure to take a look at what’s already built-in to your device – you just might be surprised at what you find!\nToday, we will look at five (5) features present in our smartphones that we did not have a clue about, but will most likely start using immediately\nSmartphones are an important part of our life nowadays. Most of us cannot go for an hour without checking our phones let alone a whole day, without feeling like we are missing out on life.\nAs much as we all like to imagine ourselves to be experienced smartphone users, it is not possible to be cognizant of all the functionalities our device(s) possesses. This is majorly due to the rapid technological enhancement of these devices and not because we are ignorant.\nNow, let’s take a look at some features many Android smartphone owners don’t use majorly because they aren’t aware of their existence.\n1. Android Guest Mode You will find this handy if you are a person who shares your phone regularly with other people. Guest mode allows you to maintain your privacy by hiding personal items like photos and texts.\nTo enable this, Scroll down your notification bar, tap the user icon, then tap guest, your phone will now switch to guest mode. We have written about Guest Mode and how to set it up on your device in the tutorial linked below. You should check it out.\nRead More: What is Guest Mode in Android? (and How to set it up)\n2. Developer Options We have talked about developer options on this platform in detail. To learn how to enable this feature, you can read here.\nIn summary, these are advanced system settings mainly used by developers for debugging in the development of Android apps.\nRead More: Top 8 Reasons to enable Developer Options\nOne of the tens of features under this hidden menu is changing your device’s animation speed. Reducing the transition animation scale to .5x will give your phone a snappier faster feel. You might want to enable some of these options and dig in.\n3. Custom Text on Lock Screen In your phone’s lock screen security settings, there is a feature called “Lock Screen Message”. This is information that will display on the screen when the device locks up.\nThis is useful in case you lose/misplace your phone and a “good samaritan” wants to return it to you. You may have an alternative phone number in the message like “return to 07xx xxx xxx”.\n4. Split-screen mode Today, the average smartphone has a screen size of 6-inches. This is a lot of screen real-estate that can be better utilized.\nWhat better way to utilize this than to use two different apps at the same time. Since Android 6 Marshmallow, Android has natively supported split-screen mode.\nTo enable this, simply go to the app you want to use, long-press the multitasking key and select the second app. The two apps will then split the view in either half of your display. You can resize the windows using the slider in the middle of the display.\n5. Screen Pinning This feature was introduced with Android 5.0 Lillipop. It basically pins a single app to the device’s screen and disables the home and recent apps buttons restricting one to only the pinned app. This is quite useful in case you have a toddler playing a game and you don’t want them to accidentally call your boss at night.\nTo activate this tap the app switcher/recent apps button, then tap the pin on the bottom right of the most recent app (the app you want to pin), you will see a message displayed as “Screen pinned”. To exit long-press the back button a message will be displayed as “screen unpinned”\nRead more about screen pinning\nYou may not be able to start using all these smartphone features at once but we hope to have highlighted a few that will change your Android smartphone experience.\nIt is also worth noting that, depending on your smartphone brand and your version of Android, these smartphone features might not be available for you.\nRelated ","wordCount":"1151","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Laura Huynh"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-random-smartphone-features-you-probably-don-t-know-about-955917/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Reveal the Hidden Gems of Your Smartphone: 5 Amazing Features You Never Knew Existed!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1151 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Laura Huynh</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-screen-recording>1.
