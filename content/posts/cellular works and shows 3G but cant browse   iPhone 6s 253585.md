You Won't Believe Why Your iPhone 6S Shows 3G But Can't Surf the Web - Find Out Now!

For the last couple of days, you've had a frustrating time trying to surf the web on your iPhone 6S. Despite your phone showing a 3G network, you can't seem to connect to the internet. What's happening? Is it a network issue, or is it something wrong with your phone's settings?

Well, the root of the problem may surprise you. Although your iPhone is showing a 3G network, it's actually connecting to a 2G network. And in case you're not aware, 2G networks have minimal data transfer capabilities, making it impossible to surf the web or use data-related apps. 

The reason why your iPhone is doing this is that it has a feature known as "fallback." This feature toggles automatically to the next available network in case the current network experiences instability. For instance, if your phone is on a 4G network, and it experiences a network blackout, it will automatically shift to the next available network, which is 3G. However, if you live in an area where 3G is not available, the "fallback" feature will revert to a 2G network, hence the difficulty in connecting to the internet.

So, how do you solve this problem?

Fortunately, there is a way to fix this issue, and it's pretty simple. Firstly, navigate to your iPhone's settings, select "cellular," then tap on "voice & data." Next, ensure that your phone's settings are set to 4G or LTE. This way, your phone will only connect to 3G or 2G networks if and only if the 4G/LTE network is unavailable.

Another way to fix this issue is by resetting your network settings. To do this, navigate to the "general" tab in your iPhone's settings, then scroll to the bottom and tap on the "reset" button. Next, select "reset network settings" option. Although this option will erase all your saved passwords and network settings, your phone's data will remain intact.

In conclusion, the reason why your iPhone 6S shows 3G but can't surf the web is that it's connecting to a 2G network. You can fix this issue by adjusting your phone's settings to 4G or LTE or by resetting your network settings. Hopefully, this article has shed light on this frustrating problem and guided you towards the solution.
