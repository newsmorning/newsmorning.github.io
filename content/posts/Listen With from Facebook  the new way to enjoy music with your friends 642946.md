The next thing that Facebook wants is for you to start listening music with your friends, when you are not physically together, with the new feature Listen With.
 
The social network giant has released a new feature this week that will allow you to share music tracks when chatting. Now, you and your group of friends can all be listening music together while one of you play DJ via services such as Spotify and Rdio.
 
How it works? A new music note icon will appear in the chat sidebar, next to your friend’s name. If you are interesting on knowing what they are listening hover over their name, and if you want to listen the song click the Listen With button. Then the song will start play from the service your friend is currently using.
 
You can listen to the same song, at the exact same time—so when your favorite vocal part comes in you can experience it together, just like when you’re jamming out at a performance or dance club. The company describes.
 
The cool thing about the feature is that once you started listening, your friend becomes the DJ and you can continue listening to all the song they play, which makes it a new way to discover new music. The little catch though is that you need to be signed up to the music service that your friend is connected to, and not all the time is going to be the case that everyone uses Spotify or Rdio.
 
Privacy Control: You can always control who will be able to listen your music through your settings. By default only people who you are sharing listening activity will see what you are currently playing. To control your privacy settings, check the App Settings page after you’ve installed the app. You can also remove songs you listened to from your timeline on your private activity log.
 
The Listen With feature is not yet available to everyone; Facebook is rolling it out to everyone in the next few weeks, so just keep paying attention until you start seeing the music note icon.
