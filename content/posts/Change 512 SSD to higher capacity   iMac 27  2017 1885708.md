# Revamp Your iMac 27 2017 with a Bigger SSD - The Ultimate Storage Upgrade!

If you're the proud owner of a 2017 iMac 27, you know it's a powerful machine that can take on almost any task. But as time goes by, you may start to notice that your computer's performance isn't what it used to be. One common issue is slow load times due to limited storage space. Thankfully, upgrading your iMac's SSD is an easy and cost-effective way to give your machine a new lease on life.

## Why Upgrade Your iMac's SSD?

There are several compelling reasons to upgrade your iMac's SSD. Firstly, it will improve your computer's overall performance. The iMac 27 2017 comes with a standard 1TB or optional 2TB Fusion Drive, which combines an SSD with a high-capacity hard disk drive. While this setup offers plenty of storage space, it can be slow to load applications and files. Upgrading to an SSD will significantly reduce load times, making your computer much faster and more responsive.

Secondly, upgrading your iMac's SSD will give you more storage space. Macs are notoriously difficult to upgrade, and the iMac is no exception. If you're running out of space on your Fusion Drive, upgrading to a larger SSD will give you more room for files, photos, and videos.

Finally, upgrading your iMac's SSD is cost-effective. While purchasing a new computer is expensive, upgrading your existing machine is a far more affordable option. Upgrading your SSD is also much easier than performing other upgrades, such as replacing the RAM.

## Choosing the Right SSD for Your iMac

When choosing the right SSD for your iMac, there are a few things to consider. Firstly, you need to ensure that the SSD is compatible with your iMac. The 2017 iMac 27 uses a custom form factor for its SSDs, so you'll need to purchase a compatible drive.

Secondly, you need to decide on the storage capacity you require. SSDs are available in a range of sizes, from 250GB to 4TB. It's crucial to choose a drive that offers enough storage space for your needs.

Finally, you need to consider the performance of the SSD. The speed of the drive is measured in Read/Write speeds, and higher speeds mean better performance. NVMe drives offer faster speeds than traditional SATA drives, so they're a great option for users who require high-performance storage.

## How to Install Your New SSD

Installing a new SSD into your iMac is a simple process, but it can be somewhat intimidating for first-time upgraders. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install your new SSD:

1. Firstly, shut down your iMac and unplug all cables.

2. Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws that hold the back cover in place.

3. Carefully remove the back cover to reveal the internal components of your iMac.

4. Locate the existing SSD, which is located on the right-hand side of the motherboard.

5. Gently remove the screws that hold the SSD in place and slide it out of its slot.

6. Insert your new SSD into the slot and secure it with the screws.

7. Replace the back cover, plug in your cables, and turn on your iMac.

8. Complete the macOS installation process, and your iMac is now ready to use!

## Conclusion

Upgrading your iMac's SSD is an excellent way to improve its performance and give it a new lease on life. With a larger SSD, you'll have more storage space, faster load times, and an overall faster and more responsive computer. While performing the upgrade may seem like a daunting task, it's a straightforward process that can be completed in an afternoon. If you're looking to revamp your iMac 27 2017, upgrading your SSD is the ultimate storage upgrade.

 Hello,
Does anyone know where the nomal 512 SSD is situated.
I would like to change the 512 GB SSD into a bigger one.
In the tutorial there is only a description how to change from a fusiondrive to SSD. Implements that the SSD on the backside of the mainboard has to be changed.
Now my question: where are the "normal" SSDs placed? Are they in the place where normaly the HDD are placed or do you need a special 2GB SSD which fits in the slot on the backside of the mainboard? ...for it is a big difference just to take out the display and fan or to tear down to the mainboard

 Hi there,
I believe the Blade drive SSD (Apple Proprietary) is located on the back of the logic board, if your model came with a Fusion Drive. You can just replace the regular 2.5" rotational HD with a 2.5" SSD, the Blade drive replacement will be very expensive. Before you do so, make sure to backup your unit, if you break the fusion link you will lose all data. Also if you are doing the upgrade yourself, be very careful when removed the Display the glass and the LCD are fused, and if you are not careful you will crack the glass, which means a complete the LCD+Glass replacement.
