Title: You'll Never Believe What We Discovered When We Tore Down the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus!

Introduction:
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were released in 2014, marking a significant step forward for Apple in terms of engineering and design. The devices were highly popular, with millions of units sold worldwide. But what happens when you take apart an iPhone 6? What secrets lie hidden beneath the surface of the device? In this article, we take a deep dive into what we discovered when we tore down the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

Body:
The first thing we noticed when we opened up the iPhone 6 was the large battery. At 1810mAh, it's the largest battery Apple has ever used in an iPhone up to that point. But interestingly, the battery in the iPhone 6 Plus was even larger, with a capacity of 2915mAh. This helped to power the larger display, which was a major selling point of the device.

Moving on, we discovered a new chip called the A8. This chip was designed specifically for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and was chipmaker TSMC's first opportunity to produce a chip for Apple. The A8 offered a significant increase in performance compared to the previous A7 chip, with improved graphics processing, faster clock speeds, and superior power management.

Another interesting aspect of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is the camera. The devices featured an 8MP rear camera and a 1.2MP front-facing camera, which were both capable of taking high-quality photos and videos. However, we noticed that the camera in the iPhone 6 Plus was noticeably larger than the one in the iPhone 6. This is likely due to the optical image stabilization feature, which helps to reduce blur in photos and videos.

We also discovered that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were built to be more durable than previous iPhone models. Both devices featured a strengthened aluminum body and ion-strengthened glass, which made them more resistant to drops and impacts.

Conclusion:
Over the years, Apple has continued to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible with smartphones. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were a major milestone in Apple's history, and our teardown revealed some of the secrets behind their design and engineering. From the large batteries to the new A8 chip, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were impressive devices that still hold up well today.

## Chosen Solution
 How do i open the great iPhone 6 do check on the power on button? please help. Am a techy guy

 You have to get one first I think.
There are screws just the same as other iPhones. After that maybe the LCD is still a clip on. Remove as before, mind the Touch ID cable.
UPDATE: Teardown photo of iPhone 6 (from someone else), showing our old friends: screws and clips
The Touch ID component still goes with the display, but there is no socket left on the bottom, and the dock connector cable assembly pics leaked before does not show a socket on it. So I believe the Touch ID cable is plugged into the display module instead.

 These people already does a teardown

 can't wait for you to figure it out and tell us!  Have they done away with the two bottom screws?

 I'd imagine if there are no screws we'll be looking at adhesive which will need the iopener to get past.

 the Repair guide is not even on Apple's GSX yet i'm guessing that is what the Sept 14th update is for.

 If screws are there at rear of device then it won't be like the 5th gen and it had no screws and was glued in place why would they put screws if it was glued in.. Think about it

 I got a  teardown preview of the iPhone 6.  Follow this link.
