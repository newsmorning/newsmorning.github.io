However, many users have reported facing errors like ‘Failed to initialize’ while using it, which can be a frustrating experience. Such errors can prevent the antivirus from functioning properly and leave the system vulnerable to security threats. If you are facing the same issue, worry not, as we have got some expert solutions to help you fix the ‘Failed to initialize’ issue and strengthen your system’s security.\nBody:\nSolution 1: Update Windows Defender\nOne of the most common reasons why you may encounter the ‘Failed to initialize’ error in Windows Defender is outdated software. Microsoft regularly releases updates for its antivirus program to improve its functionality and fix bugs. Therefore, updating Windows Defender to its latest version can help resolve the issue. Here’s how to do it:\nOpen the Windows Security app and click the ‘Virus \u0026 threat protection’ option. Click ‘Check for updates’ to see if there is any available update. If there are updates, download and install them. Solution 2: Restart the Security Center Service\nThe Security Center Service is responsible for running Windows Defender smoothly. If this service fails to work correctly, you may face the ‘Failed to initialize’ error. Restarting the service can help resolve the issue. Follow these simple steps:\nPress the ‘Windows + R’ keys and type “services.msc” to open the list of services. Look for the “Security Center” option and right-click on it. Choose “Restart” from the menu. Solution 3: Clean Boot Your System\nSome third-party applications running in the background can interfere with Windows Defender’s proper functioning. To identify and disable those applications, you can perform a clean boot of your system. Follow these steps:\nPress the ‘Windows + R’ keys and type “msconfig” to open the System Configuration window. Go to the “Services” tab and select the option ‘Hide all Microsoft services.’ Click the “Disable all” button. Go to the “Startup” tab and select “Open Task Manager.” Disable all startup applications. Restart your system. Solution 4: Uninstall and Reinstall Windows Defender\nIf none of the above solutions work, then uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Defender may help fix the issue. Follow these steps:\nPress the ‘Windows + R’ keys and type “appwiz.cpl” to open the Programs and Features window. Look for Windows Defender in the list of programs and right-click on it. Select “Uninstall.” Once the antivirus is uninstalled, restart your system. Open the Settings app and click “Update \u0026 Security.” Click “Windows Security,” and under “Virus \u0026 threat protection,” click “Manage settings.” Click “Add or remove exclusions” and then “Add an exclusion.” Choose “Folder” and add the “C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender” folder. Restart your system and reinstall Windows Defender. Solution 5: Use a Reliable Third-Party Antivirus Program\nIf all the above solutions fail to work, you may explore using a third-party antivirus program, as they can provide better protection than Windows Defender. Ensure that you choose a reliable software program, and it is used to protect your system from any potential security threats.\nConclusion:\nWindows Defender’s ‘Failed to initialize’ error can be a frustrating issue, leaving your system vulnerable to various security threats. The above solutions, such as updating Windows Defender, restarting the Security Center Service, performing a clean boot of your system, and reinstalling the program, can quickly help you fix this issue.
