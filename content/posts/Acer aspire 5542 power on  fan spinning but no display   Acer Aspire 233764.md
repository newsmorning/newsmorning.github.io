Title: 5542 - The Troubling Truth Behind Its Mysterious Black Screen and Revving Fan!

Introduction: 
Laptops are a vital part of our life, and they help us stay connected with the world. However, sometimes they can give us a hard time by malfunctioning or behaving oddly. One such issue is the black screen and revving fan in HP laptops, particularly the model number 5542. In this article, we will dig deeper into this problem, exploring the possible causes and offering solutions to overcome it.

The Cause of the Problem:
A black screen and revving fan in an HP laptop can be due to several causes. Typically, the issue occurs due to the failure of the graphics card or processor, overheating, malware, or even a loose connection between the LCD screen and the motherboard. Usually, when the system heats up beyond the limit, it takes the necessary precautionary measures and turns off the monitor, leaving only the fan working to avoid any further damage.

Solving the Issue:
When faced with a blank screen and a revving fan, HP laptop users need not panic. There are several solutions available that can help fix the issue. One of the primary solutions is to check if there is any dust buildup inside the computer that is causing it to overheat. At times, cleaning the system vents and fans, by using a can of compressed air or a soft-bristled brush, can work wonders.

Another common solution is to check for a loose connection between the LCD screen and the motherboard. It is advisable to seek professional help for this particular issue, as tinkering around with delicate computer parts can cause further damage.

Sometimes, the issue may stem from outdated BIOS, and updating it with the help of HP's support website or an expert can be an easy fix.

If the problem persists even after trying the above solutions, then it is essential to seek professional help or get in touch with HP's customer care support immediately.

Conclusion:
The black screen and revving fan issue in HP laptops are not uncommon, but it should not become a cause for despair. There are several ways in which users can fix the matter by themselves, or seek expert help if needed. It is crucial to understand that taking preventative measures, such as regularly cleaning the system, staying updated with the software and programs, and not overusing the system can help avoid such issues in the future. By following these simple steps, laptop users can ensure a seamless and long-lasting experience from their HP laptops.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I have an acer aspire 5542 laptop that turns on, the fan spins but I have no display. I'm pretty sure the issue is with the motherboard or the gpu on the board, but don't know how to test it.
First, I'm wondering if a dead gpu can be hot? Can he produce some heat?
I don't want to buy another board, this is a old laptop and I just want to learn and try to fix it by myself. However, I don't know where to begin with.
I was thinking about testing voltage on the display connector to know if atleast the current goes there, but as I said I'm not sure and this is my first time so I don't have any kind of experience and for the moment I'm just trying to figure out where to begin with.

 try taking out the battery and charger and hold down the power button for 60 seconds. if that doesnt help it could also be a ram issue
