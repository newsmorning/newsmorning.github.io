Introduction

Gaming is more than a hobby for many gamers; it's a passion. And if you're passionate about something, you do it with style. A boring gaming setup can suck the fun out of an otherwise exciting pastime. Luckily, with a Razer Ouroboros gaming mouse, you'll never have a dull moment. In this article, we'll show you how to keep your Razer Ouroboros lights flashing like a pro.

Background Information

The Razer Ouroboros is an ambidextrous gaming mouse with customizable lighting. It has a 8200 DPI 4G Laser Sensor, and the battery life can last up to 12 hours with the lights turned off. But let's face it, no gamer is willing to compromise on some extra bling for longer battery life. Here are some tips on how to keep your Razer Ouroboros lights flashing without compromising the battery life.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Install Razer Synapse

Before you can customize your Razer Ouroboros lights, you need to install Razer Synapse. It's the software that lets you customize your gaming mouse as per your liking. You can download it from the Razer website for free.

Step 2: Set Up a Profile

Once you install the software, you can set up profiles based on the games you play. For example, if you play Fortnite, you can have a Fortnite-specific profile that will change your mouse's colors to match the game's aesthetics.

Step 3: Choose a Color Scheme

Now that you have your profiles set up, it's time to choose a color scheme. Razer Synapse offers a range of preset color schemes to choose from. But if you want to get fancy, you can create your own color scheme.

Step 4: Assign Colors to Mouse Buttons

The next step is to assign colors to the mouse buttons. You can differentiate between the left, right, and middle mouse buttons, scroll wheel, and side buttons by assigning a unique color to each button.

Step 5: Adjust the Brightness

After assigning the colors, you might want to adjust the brightness of your Razer Ouroboros lights. You can do this by going to the Chroma Studio tab in Razer Synapse and sliding the bar between Brightness and Saturation.

Step 6: Save Your Settings

Finally, save your settings and enjoy your custom lighting profile. You can access it anytime by switching to the appropriate gaming profile.

Conclusion

In conclusion, keeping your Razer Ouroboros lights flashing is easier than you think. All you need is Razer Synapse, a little creativity, and some time to experiment. Don't let a boring gaming setup ruin your gaming experience- take customization to the next level with your Razer Ouroboros.
