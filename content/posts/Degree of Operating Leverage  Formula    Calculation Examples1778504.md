Unlock the Secret to Financial Success with this Powerful Operating Leverage Formula! Shocking Calculation Examples Inside!

Financial success is something that everyone dreams of achieving, but not everyone is able to reach. One of the key factors that determine financial success is the concept of operating leverage. Simply put, operating leverage is the extent to which fixed costs are used in the production process of a company. This concept can be used to generate greater profits with limited resources, leading to financial success. In this article, we will discuss the operating leverage formula and provide you with some shocking examples to help you better understand the concept.

The Formula

The operating leverage formula is straightforward and easy to understand. It is as follows:

Operating Leverage = % Change in Operating Income / % Change in Sales

This formula is used to calculate the degree of operating leverage, which indicates how much a company's operating income can be affected by changes in sales volume. By understanding the degree of operating leverage, companies can determine how much fixed costs they need to cover before they start generating profits.

Example 1

Let's take a look at a simple example to illustrate the concept of operating leverage. Suppose Company A has fixed operating costs of $100,000 and variable costs of $50 per unit. If the company sells 1,000 units at $100 each, the company's revenue would be $100,000 (1,000 units x $100), and the total costs would be $150,000 ($100,000 fixed costs + (1,000 units x $50 variable costs per unit)). The operating income would be -$50,000 ($100,000 revenue - $150,000 total costs).

Now, let's assume that Company A increases its sales volume to 2,000 units. The company's revenue would then be $200,000 (2,000 units x $100), and the total costs would be $200,000 ($100,000 fixed costs + (2,000 units x $50 variable costs per unit)). The operating income would be $0 ($200,000 revenue - $200,000 total costs).

Using the operating leverage formula, we can calculate the degree of operating leverage as follows:

Degree of Operating Leverage = (% Change in Operating Income / % Change in Sales)
= (($0-$(-50,000)) / ($200,000-$100,000))
= 0.5

The degree of operating leverage for Company A is 0.5. This means that a 1% increase in sales will result in a 0.5% increase in operating income.

Example 2

Now, let's look at another example to see how a change in the degree of operating leverage can impact a company's financial success. Let's say Company B also has fixed operating costs of $100,000 and variable costs of $50 per unit. If it sells 1,000 units at $100 each, revenue would be $100,000, and the total costs would be $150,000. The operating income would also be -$50,000.

However, instead of increasing sales volume to 2,000 units, Company B increases it to 3,000 units. The revenue would then be $300,000 (3,000 units x $100), and the total costs would be $250,000 ($100,000 fixed costs + (3,000 units x $50 variable costs per unit)). The operating income would be $50,000 ($300,000 revenue - $250,000 total costs).

Using the operating leverage formula again, we can calculate the degree of operating leverage as follows:

Degree of Operating Leverage = (% Change in Operating Income / % Change in Sales)
= (($50,000-$(-50,000)) / ($300,000-$100,000))
= 0.5

The degree of operating leverage for Company B is also 0.5. But notice that Company B generates a profit of $50,000 with the same degree of operating leverage that made Company A lose $50,000. This is due to the difference in sales volume. The higher sales volume for Company B leads to higher revenue and lower overall costs, giving it an advantage.

Conclusion

Operating leverage can be a powerful tool for businesses to improve their financial success. The degree of operating leverage can indicate how much fixed costs a company needs to cover before it starts generating profits. By increasing sales volume and keeping variable costs low, a business can achieve greater profits with limited resources. The operating leverage formula is simple and easy to use, and by understanding it, businesses can improve their decision-making processes and financial outcomes.

## What is a Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL)?
 
### Degree of Operating Leverage Formula
 
The formula is used to determine the impact of a change in a company’s sales on the operating income of that company.
 
- The concept of DOL revolves around the proportion of fixed costs and variable costs in the overall cost structure of a company.A company with a higher proportion of fixed costs has a higher DOL than a company with a higher proportion of variable costs. If the DOL is high, then the earnings before interest and taxesEarnings Before Interest And TaxesEarnings before interest and tax (EBIT) refers to the company's operating profit that is acquired after deducting all the expenses except the interest and tax expenses from the revenue. It denotes the organization's profit from business operations while excluding all taxes and costs of capital.read more (EBIT) are more sensitive to the percentage change in sales while all other variables remain the same and vice versa.

 
The formula of Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) is derived by dividing the percentage change in the EBIT by the percentage change in the sales, and it is represented as,
 
Formula = Percentage change in EBIT / Percentage change in sales

Conversely, the formula for DOL can also be derived by dividing the contribution marginContribution MarginThe contribution margin is a metric that shows how much a company's net sales contribute to fixed expenses and net profit after covering the variable expenses. As a result, we deduct the total variable expenses from the net sales when computing the contribution.read more by the EBIT of the company, which is mathematically represented as,
 
Formula = Contribution margin / EBIT
 
It can be further expanded as shown below,
 
Degree of Operating Leverage Formula = (Sales – Variable cost) / (Sales – Fixed cost – Variable cost)
 
### Explanation
 
Next, determine the sales during the current year and the previous year. Now, compute the percentage change in sales initially by deducting the sales of the previous year from that of the current year and then dividing the result by the sales of the previous year as shown below,
 
### Examples
 
Let’s see some simple to advanced examples to understand them better.
 
- Firstly, determine the operating income vs. EBIT during the current and previous years. Now, compute the percentage change in EBIT initially by deducting the EBIT of the previous year from that of the current year and then dividing the result by the EBIT of the previous year as shown below, Percentage change in EBIT = (EBIT current year EBIT previous year) / EBIT previous year * 100% Next, determine the sales during the current year and the previous year. Now, compute the percentage change in sales initially by deducting the sales of the previous year from that of the current year and then dividing the result by the sales of the previous year as shown below, Percentage change in sales = (Sales current year Sales previous year) / Sales previous year * 100% Finally, the formula can be calculated by dividing the value in Step 1 by that of Step 2 as above.

 
Percentage change in EBIT = (EBIT current year EBIT previous year) / EBIT previous year * 100%
 
Percentage change in sales = (Sales current year Sales previous year) / Sales previous year * 100%
 

 
#### Example #1
 
Let us take the example of Company A, which has clocked sales of $800,000 in year one, which further increased to $1,000,000 in year two. In year one, the operating expensesOperating ExpensesOperating expense (OPEX) is the cost incurred in the normal course of business and does not include expenses directly related to product manufacturing or service delivery. Therefore, they are readily available in the income statement and help to determine the net profit.read more stood at $450,000, while in year two, the same went up to $550,000. Determine the DOL for Company A.
 
Use the following data for the calculation of the Degree of Operating Leverage.
 
EBIT in year 1
 
- EBIT in year 1 = Sales in year 1 – Operating expense in year 1= $800,000 – $450,000= $350,000

 
EBIT in Year 2 
 
- EBIT in year 2 = Sales in year 2 – Operating expense in year 2= $1,000,000 – $550,000= $450,000

 
Change in EBIT
 
- Change in EBIT = EBIT in year 2 – EBIT in year 1= $450,000 – $350,000= $100,000

 
Percentage Change in EBIT
 
- Percentage change in EBIT = Change in EBIT / EBIT in year 1 * 100%= $100,000 / $350,000 * 100%= 28.57%

 
Change in Sales
 
- Change in sales = Sales in year 2 – Sales in year 1= $1,000,000 – $800,000= $200,000

 
Percentage Change in Sales
 
- Percentage change in sales = Change in sales / Sales in year 1 * 100%= $200,000 / $800,000 * 100%= 25.00%

 
Calculation of Degree of Operating Leverage will be –
 
Now, DOL Formula = Percentage change in EBIT / Percentage change in sales
 
- DOL Formula= 28.57% / 25.00%= 1.14

 
Therefore, the DOL of Company A is 1.14.
 
#### Example #2
 
Calculate Degree of Operating Leverage for Company B. Let us take the example of another Company, B, which is in the business of chocolate manufacturing and, in the current year, has achieved a sales volume of 18,000 pieces with an average sales price of $50 per piece. The company’s overall cost structure is such that the fixed cost is $100,000, while the variable cost is $25 per piece.
 
Sales = Sales volume * Average sales price per piece
 
- = 18,000 * $50= $900,000

 
Variable cost = Sales volume * Variable cost per piece
 
- = 18,000 * $25= $450,000

 
Contribution Margin
 
Contribution margin = Sales – Variable cost
 
- = $900,000 – $450,000= $450,000

 
EBIT
 
EBIT = Sales – Variable cost – Fixed cost
 
- = $900,000 – $450,000 – $100,000= $350,000

 
Calculation will be as follows –
 
Now, DOL Formula = Contribution margin / EBIT
 
- DOL Formula = $450,000 / $350,000

 
- = 1.29

 
Therefore, the DOL of Company B is 1.29.

### Relevance and Uses
 
It is important to understand the concept of the DOL formula because it helps a company appreciate the effects of operating leverage on the probable earnings of the company. It is a key ratio for a company to determine a suitable level of operating leverage to secure the maximum benefit out of a company’s operating income.
 
If a company has high operating leverage, then it means that a large proportion of its overall cost structure is due to fixed costsFixed CostsFixed Cost refers to the cost or expense that is not affected by any decrease or increase in the number of units produced or sold over a short-term horizon. It is the type of cost which is not dependent on the business activity.read more. Such a company will enjoy huge changes in profits with a relatively smaller increase in sales. On the other hand, if a company has low operating leverage, then it means that variable costs contribute a large proportion of its overall cost structureOverall Cost StructureCost Structure refers to those costs or expenses (fixed as well as variable costs) which businesses will incur or will have to incur to produce the desired objective of the business; such costs include the cost of purchasing the raw material to the cost of packaging the finished products.read more. Such a company does not need to increase sales per se to cover its lower fixed costs, but it earns a smaller profit on each incremental sale.
