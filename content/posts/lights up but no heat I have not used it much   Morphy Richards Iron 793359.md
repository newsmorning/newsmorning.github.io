Title: You'll Never Believe Why This Morphy Richards Iron is Light Up But Won't Heat Up!

Introduction:
Ironing clothes is an everyday chore for most of us, and a good quality iron is essential to keep our clothes wrinkle-free. Morphy Richards is a well-known brand that produces some of the best irons on the market. However, have you ever encountered a situation where your Morphy Richards iron won't heat up even when it is lighted up? If yes, then you're not alone. In this article, we'll explain why your Morphy Richards iron is lighted up but won't heat up.

The Cause:
The primary reason why your Morphy Richards iron is lighted up but won't heat up is because of a faulty thermal fuse. The thermal fuse is a safety device that prevents the iron from overheating and damaging the internal components. When the temperature of the iron becomes too high, the thermal fuse will break the circuit and cut off the power supply to the heating element. This prevents the iron from heating up and causing a fire hazard.

Symptoms:
A faulty thermal fuse is indicated when the iron light is lit, but there is no heat produced. In most cases, you'll hear a soft clicking sound when the iron is switched on, and the light flickers, indicating that something is not right. It is also essential to note that a faulty thermal fuse is not the only reason why your iron may not heat up. Other factors that can affect the iron's heating capacity include power cord issues, malfunctioning thermostat, and worn-out heating elements.

Solution:
Fixing a faulty thermal fuse is quite easy, and you don't need to be an expert to do it. First, unplug the iron from the power source and allow it to cool down. Next, unscrew the iron plate cover and locate the thermal fuse. Check the fuse with a multimeter to confirm if it's faulty. If the fuse is indeed faulty, then you can replace it with a new one. It's essential to use the same fuse rating as the old one.

Prevention:
Preventing your Morphy Richards iron from developing a faulty thermal fuse can save you money and ensure your safety. Ensure that you avoid overloading the iron with tasks that it is not designed to handle. Avoid leaving the iron plugged in when not in use, as it can cause overheating, resulting in a blown thermal fuse. Regular cleaning of the iron can also prevent blockage that can hinder the heat dissipation.

Conclusion:
A faulty thermal fuse is a common problem that can render your Morphy Richards iron useless. However, with the right information, you can quickly diagnose and fix the problem yourself. Remember to always take safety precautions when fixing your iron, and if you're not confident, seek professional help. Prevention is also essential to avoid future problems with your iron. With these tips, you can keep your Morphy Richards iron working efficiently for years to come.

 Just open the Iron and adjust the thermo control and see it's heating or not .
If the Iron got heat it's ok or if not heat check the elements in the bottom then you can sure the fault.

 Normally Heating devices are protected with what we called “Thermal Fuse” which are connected
in Series to the Main Line, If you can locate it it looks like a small fuse,  crimped in a wire sometimes and comes in a different color like yellow, white  or black.
sometimes it is covered by a shrinkable tube if you know it.
If you can use a Multimeter you can test the Leads of the Heating Element from end to end
there should be a low resistance reading from your meter should appear, if it not reads at all then your heating
filament is open. Its a sealed type.
please think always Safety do not work on it with Power connected , be sure Unplug the Power and
ask for a qualified serviceman if your not sure on doing it.
Have a nice day.

 you can open the lid and check if power cable is disconnected from the element or maybe the element has blown up note that is irreplaceble
