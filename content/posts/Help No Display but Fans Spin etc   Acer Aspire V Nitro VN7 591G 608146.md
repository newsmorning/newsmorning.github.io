This process is relatively simple, but you need to be careful while disassembling the laptop. Once the laptop was disassembled, we removed the RAM sticks and re-seated them in the slots. After re-assembling the laptop, it successfully booted up with no issue. The fans were spinning, and the screen was functioning correctly.

## Chosen Solution
 Help No Display but Fans Spin etc
So it didn't work at first,
then i messed around cant remember what i did but it started working after opening for a while then i opened again to put things better in place.
It has a blank display not connecting to HDMI, but powers up, fans spin etc.
I have tried hairdryer, cleaning MOBO, External Monitor, Heating GPU, Taking both batteries out,, Power for 60 secs etc.
Is there an multi meter test i can do to see if its the GPU e.g. not getting enough power.
I'm unsure.
Is there any motherboard test i can do or buy a motherboard diagnostics card etc.
I would like to find out problem if possible.

 Hi,
Have you tried different RAM, sometimes faulty RAM can cause a laptop not displaying, also on a few occasions the clock speed of the RAM is too high for the laptop , try with 1 RAM in the slot or borrow a working RAM to use, if that doesn't work and you already tried an external monitor, the motherboard might be faulty as well.
Hope this helps and hope you come right
