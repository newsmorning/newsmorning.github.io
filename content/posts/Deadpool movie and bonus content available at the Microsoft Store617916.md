Deadpool is one of the most popular movies of 2016 and now, it has finally landed on the Microsoft Store. The movie comes with a package of 11 bonuses to reward your purchase.
 
A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, Wade Wilson realizes he now has accelerated healing powers following an experiment he was subjected to.

The film harmoniously intertwines action sequences that make you hold your breath with extremely humorous parts that will keep you laughing for minutes. Deadpool has an 8.3 rating on IMDB so people are simply in love with this movie:
 
Hold onto your chimichangas, folks. From the studio that brought you all 3 Taken films comes the block-busting, fourth-wall-breaking masterpiece about Marvel Comics’ sexiest anti-hero! Starring God’s perfect idiot Ryan Reynolds and a bunch of other “actors,” DEADPOOL is a giddy slice of awesomeness packed with more twists than Deadpool’s enemies’ intestines and more action than prom night. Amazeballs!
 
If you haven’t heard yet about this movie, you can watch the trailer below:
 
This movie is by far the most exciting super hero movie yet!
 
Please be warned, this movie is extremely inappropriate, but an absolute thrill ride. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is the perfect fit. Just when you think he could not get any more clever with his words, he would say the most off the wall comments possible.
 
The fighting sequences in this were incredibly jaw dropping! Deadpool really is one of the most innovative fighters I have seen. His techniques are totally unorthodox and cannot be matched nor mimicked by any other who dares.
 
The only thing that was not satisfying is the length of the movie. It was much shorter than expected. The backstory to Wade Wilson before becoming Deadpool is short lived. Despite that, it still was an excellent movie, and I cannot wait for more!
 

 
You can watch Deadpool on your Xbox One, Windows 10 or Windows 8 device, and Windows Phone 8. If you want to watch it offline, download it on your Windows 10 device, Windows 8 device, and Windows Phone 8.
 
The movie has been rated R for strong violence and language, sexual content, and graphic nudity so send the kids out of the room when you hit the play button.
 
Buy Deadpool from the Microsoft Store and get the bonus pack for only $14.99.
