Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to This iPhone After Back Replacement - Home and Power Buttons Stopped Working! 

Introduction:

iPhones have become an integral part of our daily lives as they help us in communicating with others, conducting online transactions, and accessing social media platforms. However, like any other electronic device, iPhones can experience issues such as battery drainage, frozen screens, and damage to the screen or back. 

One of the most common reasons people replace the back of their iPhones is to improve its aesthetic appeal. However, your satisfaction with your phone’s new look can quickly turn sour if some functional parts cease to function properly, rendering your phone virtually useless. In this article, we will explore what can happen to your iPhone following a back replacement and what you can do to avoid it. 

What Happened to My iPhone After Back Replacement?

After iPhone users have replaced the back of their device, it's not uncommon to find that some vital parts stop working, such as the home and power buttons. This often occurs because of DIY mobile phone repair or working with an inexperienced, unskilled technician. 

In our case, after a professional technician replaced the back of our iPhone, the home and power buttons stopped working. We could not access Siri or close open apps using either of the buttons, making it virtually impossible to use the device, which was frustrating.

Why Did the Home and Power Buttons Stop Working?

In most cases, the home and power buttons can stop working following the back replacement because of several reasons, such as:

1. Misaligned Display Assembly:

When replacing the back of your iPhone, the technician can accidentally misalign the display assembly, causing the home and power buttons to stop working. Most displays have a small ribbon that connects the buttons to the phone's logic board, and any misalignment can interfere with its operation.

2. Cable Tear:

The process of back replacement can involve disconnecting some cables and ribbon connectors. During the process, cables and ribbon connectors can stretch or get damaged, causing tears that prevent the button functions.

3. Damaged Logic Board:

Replacing the back of your iPhone requires some level of expertise, and if the process isn't done correctly, it can lead to damages to the iPhone's logic board. The home and power buttons can stop working or start malfunctioning if the logic board is damaged.

What Can You Do to Fix the Home and Power Buttons?

If the home and power buttons' functions have stopped working after a back replacement, there are several things you can do:

1. Check for Misaligned Display Assembly:

You can check to ensure that the display assembly is correctly aligned. If the issue is a misaligned display, you can correct the problem by re-aligning it correctly.

2. Check for Cable Tear:

You can check if the process of replacing the back caused any damage or tears to the cables and ribbon connectors. If there's a tear, you can replace the cable or ribbon connector to restore the button's functionality.

3. Repair the Damaged Logic Board:

If the home and power buttons' functions do not resume after addressing the display assembly and cable, it's likely that the logic board is damaged. You can contact a professional and skilled technician to examine the phone and repair or replace the damaged logic board. 

Conclusion:

In conclusion, iPhones play a significant role in our daily lives, and having a device with a beautiful back that doesn't function correctly can be frustrating. At times, the back replacement process can cause some parts, such as the home and power buttons, to stop working; however, this can be fixed by a skilled technician. It's always essential to work with a professional technician when replacing your iPhone's back to avoid any damages and ensure the device is functional.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the back and chassis on my iPhone 8 today after shattering the rear glass. I got everything refitted and connected up and discovered that the power and home buttons aren’t working. While carrying out the repair when I was tightening the Taptic Engine down to the metal back plate the studs sheared off so I had to attach the Taptic with double sided tape. When I took the phone apart again I discovered that the Taptic ribbon cable was damaged. If the Taptic isn’t working will this stop both the home and power buttons functioning?

 Hello, the iPhone 8 series home button uses a haptic feedback system - where the Taptic Engine mimics the vibration of a click. If the iPhone 8 home button still works, but vibration doesn’t work then yes that is probably due to the broken Taptic Engine. However, if it doesn’t register a touch when clicked it could be a faulty home button connection to the screen, or damaged home button (did you replace the screen?). As for the power button, that is a part of one flex cable, so if the volume buttons, flash, rear microphone and ringer still work, then you most likely tore or damaged the cable in the power button section, or as the power button is mounted using tricky brackets, check to make sure it clicks properly. I don’t see how a broken Taptic Engine would result in the power button not working. Hope this all helps (:
