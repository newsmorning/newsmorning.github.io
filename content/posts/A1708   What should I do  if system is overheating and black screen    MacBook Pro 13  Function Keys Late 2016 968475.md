Is Your Macbook Pro A1708 Overheating and Going Black? Don't Panic! Here's What You Need to Do!

As a proud owner of a Macbook Pro A1708, you might have noticed a few warning signs indicating that your device is overheating and going black. This is a common issue that many Macbook Pro users face, but there's no need to panic. In this article, we will discuss the probable causes of this problem and the solutions to deal with it effectively.

Understanding the Problem

When your Macbook Pro A1708 overheats, it shuts down automatically to prevent any damage to its internal components. If you notice that the screen has gone black, and your device is unresponsive, then it's a clear indication of overheating. The possible reasons for this situation are:

- Heavy Workload: Running multiple heavy applications simultaneously, using demanding software, playing high-end games or working with complex graphics can cause your Macbook Pro to overheat.
- Malfunctioning Cooling System: If the cooling system of your Macbook Pro is not working correctly, then the device will overheat, and the screen will go black.
- Dusty Fans and Vents: If the fans and vents of your Macbook Pro A1708 are filled with dust and debris, then they will not function optimally, resulting in overheating.

What You Can Do About It

Here are some effective solutions to fix your Macbook Pro A1708 when it's overheating and going black:

- Reduce the Workload: Try closing unused applications, disconnecting devices, and lowering the brightness to reduce the workload on your device. Avoid running resource-intensive applications that require a lot of processing power.
- Fix the Cooling System: It's always advisable to take your Macbook Pro to an authorized service center to fix any issues with the cooling system that might be causing the device to overheat. If you prefer to do it yourself, you can check online tutorials and guides to fix the cooling system.
- Clean the Fans and Vents: Over time, the fans and vents of your Macbook Pro A1708 collect dust, which reduces their efficiency. You can fix this by using a can of compressed air or a soft brush to clean the fans and vents.

Preventing Overheating in the Future

Once you've fixed your Macbook Pro A1708 overheating issue, you can take steps to prevent it in the future:

- Keep your device elevated: When you're using your Macbook Pro A1708, make sure to keep it elevated to improve airflow and ventilation.
- Install Temperature Monitoring Apps: There are multiple temperature monitoring apps available for Macbook Pro users. Installing such an app will help you keep track of the device's temperature and prevent overheating.
- Invest in a Cooling Pad: If you use your Macbook Pro A1708 for extended periods, you can invest in a cooling pad to improve the airflow and keep your device cool.

Final Words

In conclusion, if you notice your Macbook Pro A1708 overheating and going black, there's no need to panic. The issue can usually be fixed by reducing your device's workload, fixing the cooling system, or cleaning the fans and vents. By following the preventive measures discussed in this article, you can help keep your device running smoothly and keep it from overheating in the future.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello?
I have MBP 2016, recently there’s some problem:
1) power on
2) chime one time and fan spining around 20 sec
3) fan stop
4) booting and can see the logo
5) into the main screen… 2~3 minutes later system halted and black out.
The heat pipe and CPU area very hot… because of no fan spin.
When I check the diagnose, mac said ADP000, no errors.
What shall I do firstly.
I don’t want to hear, change my logic board… very simple answer.
Thank you in advance!

 Let me start off with the short answer you don’t want to hear: Replace the logic board!
Now the long answer…
Find the schematics and board views for this system (locate the 820-???? number on the logic board).
Watch Louis Rossmann’s YouTube vids on how to diagnose logic boards.
Test your systems power rail circuits using your bench power supply & DVM and USB-C power meter. Use a  high speed storage oscilloscope to review the output signals making sure they are present.
Then you’ll need to have the micro soldering tools to desolder the bad components and find replacements and then soldering them on.
Conclusion
By the time you bought all of this gear and the hours of debugging the logic board, it would be easier and cheaper just to … (insert the simple answer)
Or, find someone who has already made the investment ands the skills letting them to the work. That maybe not an option for you as you may need to ship your system to them.
