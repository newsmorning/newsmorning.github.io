Do you still carry CDs or DVDs to install applications and software on your computer? If so, it’s time to ditch them and embrace portable apps. These apps don’t require installation and can run directly from your USB stick. Plus, they don’t leave any trace on the local hard drive, making them perfect for use on public computers, college computers, and friend’s computers. So, here are the top five must-have portable apps that you can keep on your USB stick.\n1. Google Chrome Portable Are you tired of using Internet Explorer or Edge? Google Chrome is a fast and user-friendly web browser that dominates the market with its vast array of features and plug-ins. You can browse safely and privately with its incognito mode, use hundreds of extensions, and sync your bookmarks and settings. Google Chrome Portable edition is not only lightweight but also permits you to take your favourite browser and not your browsing history with you! In addition, it can be used on any Windows PC that allows you to run it directly from your USB Stick.\n2. VLC Media Player Portable Are you tired of installing multiple media players and codecs to play all types of audio and video files? VLC Media Player Portable is an all-in-one media player that can play almost any file format, including DVD’s, VCD’s, webcams, music files, and various streaming protocols. It also features an equalizer and volume boost when necessary, making your media experience even better. Furthermore, VLC Media Player Portable is not bulky and quite lightweight, making it the perfect complement to your USB Stick.\n3. CCleaner Portable If you’re looking for a portable app that can help clean up your computer without the need to install, look no further than CCleaner Portable. This utility can clear out junk and temporary files, fix registry errors, and uninstall programs. Additionally, CCleaner Portable has permission to work on most Windows versions and takes only a few seconds to start up. With CCleaner Portable, you can make any computer feel brand new again, no matter if you’re at home or in the office.\n4. Notepad++ Portable Notepad++ Portable is a powerful and flexible text editor that is perfect for coding and editing, without any installation required. This app is straightforward to use and supports syntax highlighting for many programming languages with customizable code highlighting. It also includes various advanced features like auto-completion, macros, bookmarks, and plugins that make coding much more manageable. Considering its charm, it can be carried around with ease.\n5. GIMP Portable Do you need a portable app for editing photos and graphics? GIMP Portable is an open-source and free software that can provide Photoshop-like photo editing, supporting numerous file formats, filters, and effects. This app is perfect for graphic designers and photo editors on the go. While it’s slightly more substantial than the previous apps mentioned in this list, its high-quality tools make it worth it.\nIn conclusion, these are the top 5 must-have portable apps for any computer user on the go or working in remote locations. Google Chrome Portable for web browsing, VLC Media Player Portable for media files, CCleaner Portable for cleaning up, Notepad++ Portable for coding, and GIMP Portable for photo editing. Any of these apps can be carried around on your USB stick and used on any computer that supports it, making your computing experience that much more enjoyable, profitable and easy.\nI have a bit of a soft spot for portable apps. They require no installation on your computer and can be run on a USB stick. This means your computer can stay free of all the dross files which gradually accumulates from installed software.\nBut the downside is that portable apps are only for Windows computers. To date, I have never seen any for MacOS or Linux (or maybe I am just looking in the wrong places).\nHere are some of the portable apps specifically for maintaining the Windows operating system which have proven invaluable to me. In all cases, download the portable app from the links provided below and then unzip the folder making sure to leave the folder structure and file locations in place. If you move anything inside the app folder, it won’t work.\nBleachBit When it came to deleting crap files on the computer (temporary internet files, cookies, browser history, and so forth), I always used to rely on CCleaner. But then CCleaner got hit with major controversies ranging from trojan malware, data harvesting, installing other software without permission, and more.\nSo now I use BleachBit and it is just as good. Granted, it doesn’t clean as many things as CCleaner but it does the job I want it to do and that’s the main thing. As well as cleaning Windows OS crud, you can also get it to delete unneeded files for other programs, as well as overwrite deleted files, and shred files and folders.\nBleachBit has had its moment of infamy as well, when it was discovered that Hillary Clinton used it to delete her emails in 2016.\nFixWin 10 As anyone who uses Windows well knows, the operating system is far from perfect. Problems can arise at any time and you would not know the reason why. That’s why something like FixWin 10 is very useful to have in your USB toolkit.\nMade by one of my favorite websites, FixWin 10 covers a whole multitude of potential Windows 10 issues. But the cardinal rule when using something like this is never to alter something if you don’t know what you’re doing. That is the fastest way to a Blue Screen of Death and total Windows meltdown.To be on the safe side, do a System Restore first so you can roll back any changes if you mess up.\nIf something is not working right with your Windows machine, check FixWin 10 to see if it will reset the feature for you. All it takes is a click of the mouse, and in some cases, a system reboot to see the changes.\nRevo Uninstaller Another annoyance of Windows is that when you uninstall something from the Installed Programs section, it doesn’t always delete everything related to the program. So the actual program might be gone, but temp files and start menu entries might still be there clogging up the works.\nRevo has an excellent reputation for stepping up and doing the job that Windows should be doing themselves, which is uninstalling stuff properly. As a result, it takes a while to uninstall a program but that is what happens when it is done properly.\nWhen you start the uninstallation process for a program, Revo first makes a system restore point to roll things back if necessary. Then it uninstalls the program, hunts for associated temp files, cookies, start menu entries, folders, and more. Then you can delete them in one go.\nRevo also offers a wide range of other tools such as removing Microsoft Office documents history, deleting other Windows files such as logs, a secure shredder, and more.\nZip2Fix Although the website says Zip2Fix only works up to Windows 8, I have no problem with it on Windows 10. And it has saved my hide on many occasions when important files were trapped inside a corrupted zip file and I needed to get them out. Zip2Fix to the rescue.\nObviously if the files inside are damaged beyond repair, there is nothing the program can do to un-corrupt them. But if the file can be extracted from the zip archive, then Zip2Fix is your best bet to try and get it out. No more “the dog ate my homework”. Quick, fast, and free.\nDefault Programs Editor Every file format on your computer is assigned a default program to open it. So PDFs are opened by Adobe, TXT by Notepad and PSD by Photoshop.\nBut what if your default program preferences are somehow messed up and changed? Or what if you want to easily change the default program for a particular file format? Then the portable app Default Programs Editor is here to help make your life easier.\nAs well as the default programs, you can also change autoplay settings, refresh the program icons in Windows File Explorer, and edit the right-click context menu options.\nWant More? The best places online to get portable apps is Portable Apps, SnapFiles, PortApps, and Portable Freeware Collection. Obviously, be cautious what you download as you never know how vetted each app is.\n","wordCount":"1425","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Wendy Brown"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-portable-apps-you-definitely-want-to-have-on-your-usb-stick352790/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Power of Your USB Stick with These Top 5 Must-Have Portable Apps!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 2, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1425 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Wendy Brown</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-google-chrome-portable>1.
