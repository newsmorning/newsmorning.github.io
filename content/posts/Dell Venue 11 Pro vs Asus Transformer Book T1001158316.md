## Dell Venue 11 Pro VS Asus T100
 
Going through the features and specs of both Windows 8 tablets, I have to say that the Dell Venue 11 Pro is the clear winner but it is also more expensive. Asus seems like playing from behind when it comes to the features and performance of the tablet and didn’t come on top in any category. If you are looking for a powerful and cheap Windows 8 tablet, don’t hesitate to get the new Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet.
 
update –  thanks to our reader MicroByte for making clear some things: The $399 price is for the Asus T100 with 64GB model, the 32GB model is $349 MSRP. But I didn’t manage to found the 32 GB version. Also, the Asus T100 is $349/$399 but also comes with a keyboard out of the box, which is a big differentiators. With the Dell Venue 11 Pro, you either pay $129 (thin keyboard) or $159 (battery keyboard).
