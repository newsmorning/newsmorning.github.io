# Transform Your iMac Intel 27 with 5K Display! Unleash the Power with 2TB Fusion Drive and 256GB SSD! Click Now to Upgrade!

If you own an iMac Intel 27 with 5K display, you already know how powerful and capable the machine is. But, what if we told you that there's a way to unleash even more power and performance from your iMac? Yes, you heard it right! You can transform your iMac Intel 27 with 5K display and unleash the maximum potential with a few simple upgrades. In this article, we'll show you how to upgrade your iMac with a 2TB Fusion Drive and a 256GB SSD.

## The Need for Upgrading iMac Intel 27

Firstly, let's discuss why you need to upgrade your iMac. In today's fast-paced digital world, speed and performance are crucial. If you're experiencing slow performance or storage issues with your iMac, it's time to take action. Upgrading your iMac will not only improve performance, but it will also extend its lifespan. With an upgraded iMac, you'll be able to run demanding applications, multitask, and store large files with ease.

## Upgrade Your iMac with a 2TB Fusion Drive

The first upgrade we recommend for your iMac is a 2TB Fusion Drive. A Fusion Drive combines a traditional hard drive with a solid-state drive, giving you the best of both worlds: ample storage space and fast performance. With a Fusion Drive, your iMac can boot up and launch apps quickly, transfer files faster, and multitask with ease. Plus, you'll never run out of storage space with 2TB of storage.

## Upgrade Your iMac with a 256GB SSD

The second upgrade we recommend for your iMac is a 256GB SSD. An SSD is a solid-state drive that uses flash memory to store data. Compared to traditional hard drives, SSDs are faster, quieter, and more reliable. Installing a 256GB SSD in your iMac will dramatically improve its performance, especially when it comes to booting up, launching apps, and transferring files. Plus, with an SSD, your iMac will run cooler and more efficiently.

## How to Upgrade Your iMac

Upgrading your iMac may sound daunting, but it's actually quite simple. You can either do it yourself or take it to a professional. If you're DIY-ing the upgrade, here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Back up your data: Before you start upgrading your iMac, make sure to back up all your important data to an external drive or the cloud.

2. Purchase the upgrades: You'll need to purchase a 2TB Fusion Drive and a 256GB SSD. You can find these upgrades online or at your local computer store.

3. Open your iMac: You'll need to remove the screen from your iMac to access the internal components. Apple has detailed instructions on how to do this on their website.

4. Install the Fusion Drive: Once you've opened your iMac, you can install the 2TB Fusion Drive. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to do this.

5. Install the SSD: After you've installed the Fusion Drive, you can install the 256GB SSD. Again, follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

6. Reassemble your iMac: Once you've installed both upgrades, you can put your iMac back together. Make sure everything is securely reattached before turning it back on.

## Click Now to Upgrade

Upgrading your iMac with a 2TB Fusion Drive and a 256GB SSD is a straightforward process that can dramatically improve your iMac's performance and speed. With these upgrades, you'll be able to multitask, store more files, and run demanding applications without any lag or delay. So, what are you waiting for?

## Chosen Solution
 Hi all,
I'm about to purchase my first iMac so (my iPhone not taken into account) I'm fairly new with the apple platform.
The main goal wil be music production with Ableton live9 and 3rd party  vst's with sample banks.
Therfore I want to get the best system possible preformance wise.
However, since I'm already way over my budget I want to start with the setup below containing the parts that (from what I undertsood) can't be changed later:
Hardware
4.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz
8GB 1867MHz DDR3 SDRAM - two 4GB
256GB Flash Storage
AMD Radeon R9 M390 with 2GB video memory
Magic Mouse 2
Magic Keyboard (British) & User’s Guide (English)
Accessory Kit
From what I understood I can add extra RAM later, just like I will add extra external storage for photos and movies etc.
The only thing that I´m still doubting about is which internal storage I should choose.
Apple offers 1 TB which comes with just 24GB.
I gues this is not enough for running Ableton vst's and sample banks.
However the 2 TB version is to expensive for now and 128Gb isn´t that much either.
For this reason I want to go for the 256GB  version.
The only thing that is not clear to me if it's possible to add an extral internal HDD (7200 RPM) and create a fusion drive solution later?
This gives me time to save a little and eventually get the best of two worlds?
Thanks in advance and I look forward to hear from you,
Niels

 You should be able to if my theory is correct.
iMac Intel 27" Retina 5K Display Teardown
• In this tear down you'll see this imac uses both M.2 sata storage and a 3.5" HDD.
• If the 256GB SSD is M.2 Sata you'll find the space for the massive 3.5" HDD would be left empty or with nothing but a bracket.
• If the case is the Imac with 256GB SSD is a normal SATA 2.5" with a mounting bracket to fit in the 3.5" space you'll be s*** out of luck.
To be sure my recommendation would be to go with the already prebuilt hybrid of 1TB and 24GB and here's why:
OSX is currently only 8GBs big which would leave plenty of space for important programs, any sizable files like movies and music should go on the HDD and in the future you'll easily be able to upgrade the 24GB M.2 SATA to something like 240GB for $100 aprx. Not to mention that M.2 SATA is around 6 x as fast as SSD SATAs.
hope this helps.
