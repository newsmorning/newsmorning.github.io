# Are You Tired of Dealing with a Non-Responsive Home Button on Your iPhone 6S? Find out How to Fix it Now!

If you're an iPhone 6S user, you might be familiar with the problem of a non-responsive home button. Over time, dirt, dust, and daily wear and tear can cause the home button to malfunction. If you're tired of dealing with this frustrating issue, read on to find out how to fix it now!

## Option 1:  Calibrate Your Home Button

One solution that's worth trying is calibrating your home button. Here's how:

1. Open any pre-installed app (such as the Weather app).
2. Press and hold the power button until you see the "slide to power off" option.
3. Release the power button and press and hold the home button for five seconds.
4. The app should exit and return to your home screen. Test your home button to see if it's working correctly.

If the above-mentioned solution didn't work and you are still experiencing the same issue, try cleaning your home button using the steps below.

## Option 2: Clean Your Home Button

If your iPhone 6S home button is responding slowly or not at all, cleaning it might help. Here's how to properly clean your iPhone's home button:

1. Turn off your iPhone.
2. Use a dry, soft-bristle toothbrush to gently sweep away any dirt or debris that may have accumulated around the home button.
3. Hold your device at an angle and use a toothpick to carefully dislodge any compacted dirt or debris from around the edges of the home button.
4. Gently press the home button repeatedly to help remove any remaining debris from underneath the button.
5. Turn your iPhone back on and test the home button to see if it's working.

## Option 3: Get it Repaired by a Professional

If your home button is still not responding after trying the above solutions, it could be a hardware issue that requires professional help. Apple offers repair services for iPhones, and you can also take your device to a third-party repair shop. However, keep in mind that third-party repairs can void your warranty.

In conclusion, dealing with a non-responsive home button on your iPhone 6S can be frustrating. However, there are various ways to fix it, from calibrating the button and cleaning it to getting it repaired professionally. If you've tried everything and your home button still isn't working, it's time to visit an iPhone repair shop. So, get your home button repaired and enjoy using your iPhone 6S without any hassle.

## Chosen Solution
 So I have recently repaired my Iphone 6s with a new screen. before the repair the home button was working but the touch ID wasn't. I have now replaced the screen but the home button wont respond.
I have changed the screen again as I thought it may be an issue with the long extension flex but even after replacing the screen once more the button still isn't working and I have also tried a new home button also.
Any suggestions would be appreciated please??

 so you have tried a new home button and a new home button flex cable? You may have damaged the home button connector on the logic board, did you try cleaning the connector? Also inspect the connector magnified. Look for any damaged prongs or dirt etc in there...I'm assuming you did unplug your battery before reconnecting the screen and home button flex cables onto the board right ?
