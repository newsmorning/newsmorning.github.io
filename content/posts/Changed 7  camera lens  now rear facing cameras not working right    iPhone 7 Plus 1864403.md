# Introduction

The iPhone 7 Plus was supposed to be Apple's flagship phone, offering users cutting-edge technology and advanced features. However, iPhone 7 Plus users have been experiencing a nightmare with changing 7 camera lenses. Many of them have reported that replacing the lenses has made the left rear-facing camera completely useless. This issue has left many people frustrated and wondering if the iPhone 7 Plus is worth investing in.

# The Problem

The problem with changing 7 camera lenses on the iPhone 7 Plus is that it can cause the left rear-facing camera to malfunction. Users have reported that after changing the lenses, the camera no longer focuses and the image appears blurry or distorted. Some users have also reported that the camera flash no longer works after changing the lenses.

# Apple's Response

Apple has not officially responded to this issue, leaving users to find their own solutions. Some users have tried cleaning the lens or resetting their phone, but these solutions have not worked for everyone. Others have resorted to taking their phone to an Apple store, where the technicians will replace the camera module at a cost.

# Possible Causes

There are several possible causes for the camera malfunction after changing 7 camera lenses. One possible theory is that the lens module on the iPhone 7 Plus is not designed to be changed easily, so removing and replacing it can cause damage to the delicate components of the camera. Another concern is that some users may be using third-party lenses which do not have the same quality standards as Apple's original components.

# Conclusion

Changing 7 camera lenses may seem like an easy way to upgrade your iPhone 7 Plus's photography capabilities. However, it seems that this is not the case, as many users have reported the left rear-facing camera becoming useless after making these changes. While Apple has not provided an official response, users can try cleaning the lens, resetting their phone, or seeking support from an Apple technician. If you are considering changing 7 camera lenses on your iPhone 7 Plus, it is important to proceed with caution and research the best possible solutions to avoid damaging your phone's camera.

## Chosen Solution
 I changed the rear facing camera glass with the metal piece attached. Upon completion, I checked the cameras and only the front facing camera worked in the camera app. Opening Snapchat though, the standard camera (not 2x) works as well as front camera still. But back to the camera app, it does not work. I tried a new camera flex, removing the padded metal ring, applying electric tape to the metal components possibly touching PCB. Only for a brief period (after removing padded ring, but before applying electric tape), it worked, until I closed the phone, where the problem came back. Also the flash still works, but only if the camera app hasn't been opened or is closed.

 Update!  It has saved me countless times. Have you already?
