This error message is a common issue that many users face when they browse the internet or try to access a website. It can be frustrating and can prevent you from getting your work done or accessing the content that you need.

But don't worry, there are steps you can take to fix this issue and get your Windows 10 PC back to running smoothly. In this article, we will go over the causes of Http 400 Bad Request error and steps to fix it.

## What causes Http 400 Bad Request error?

The Http 400 Bad Request error is an HTTP response status code that indicates that the server cannot understand the client's request. This error message can occur for several reasons, including:

1. Incorrect URL: If you have entered an incorrect URL, you might see the Http 400 Bad Request error message.

2. Issues with Cookies: Sometimes, your browser's cookies can cause the Http 400 Bad Request error. Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can help resolve this issue.

3. DNS issues: DNS (Domain Name System) servers might fail to provide a specific domain name to its respective IP address, which might cause the Http 400 Bad Request error.

4. Outdated Browser: Outdated browsers are not compatible with most websites, and this might cause the Http 400 Bad Request error.

## Here's how to fix Http 400 Bad Request error on your Windows 10 PC:

1. Check the URL: Double-check the URL of the website you are trying to access. Verify that the URL is accurate and correctly formatted. Ensure that there is no missing character or typing error.

2. Clear Cookies and Cache: Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can help fix the Http 400 Bad Request error. Open your browser and go to settings > history > clear browsing data. Check on the boxes 'Cookies and other site data' and 'Cached images and files' then click 'Clear data.'

3. Reset your Browser: If clearing cache and cookies didn't work, resetting your browser to default settings might be the next step. Open your browser and go to settings. Look for the reset setting, click on it, and then confirm. 

4. Update Your Browser: An outdated browser can cause the Http 400 Bad Request error. Ensure you update your browser to the latest version.

5. Check Your DNS Server Setting: If your DNS settings are incorrect, you may experience the Http 400 Bad Request error. Check your DNS settings by going to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change Adapter Settings > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Advanced > DNS. Make sure to add ‘8.8.8.8’ in the Preferred DNS server and ‘8.8.4.4’ in Alternate DNS Server before clicking OK.

6. Use a Different Browser: If all the above steps failed, try using a different browser on your Windows 10 PC. This will help determine if the issue is with your browser or your computer.

In conclusion, the Http 400 Bad Request error is annoying, but it is easy to fix. You can try the above tips until you find the right solution for your case. If none of the above works, you can contact your internet service provider, and they will assist you with troubleshooting the error.

When you surf the internet, your browser requests what you want to the server. If the server sends an HTTP code back to your browser, then you can easily browse. However, if you get an error message stating HTTP 400 bad request, then you will not be able to surf the internet. This error is different than the HTTP 504 error, which is a gateway timeout error.
 
There is no certain reason as to why this error occurs all of a sudden when one moment everything seemed fine, and the next moment, you were not able to browse any further. The most common step taken after your receive this error is to check the link entered in the address bar. If that is correct then you can move to the troubleshooting fixes below:

## Steps To Fix HTTP 400 Bad Request In Windows 10 Computer?
 
### Fix 1: Try Changing The Browsers
 
If you are in a hurry and want to surf the internet but are facing the HTTP 400 Bad Request error, then the best possible solution is to use a different browser. The All-New Microsoft Edge, which is based on Chromium, is the only browser that can be compared with Google Chrome. You can use either one instead and check if the same issue reoccurs. You can choose any browser your like.
 

 
If you are using Android, then you must try the Private Browser Care for browsing on Android devices without fear of compromise of your browsing history and activities.
 
### Fix 2: Clear The Cookies
 
Cookies are bits and pieces of information stored in our computer by various websites. This helps to load websites faster as not all the content is downloaded again. The cookies stored are always being modified depending on the latest version of the site, and this process can cause duplicate and corrupted cookies. This results in HTTP 400 Bad Request error which prevents you from surfing the internet.
 
The solution, of course, would be to remove the cookies and other temporary files stored that would not only get rid of the HTTP 400 Bad Request error but also help retrieve storage space consumed by these potentially unwanted files. There are two ways to clean them: Manual & Automatic method.
 
Manual Method: This includes manually cleaning cookies and cache for every browser by navigating to the settings and performing the cleaning task.
 
Automatic Method: This method involves using an application to optimize the computer.
 
### How to clear cookies from browsers manually?
 
It is not difficult to clear the cookies by ourselves; however, the process requires time and effort. Let us start with clearing cookies in Google Chrome and then with Microsoft Edge and Firefox.
 
Google Chrome
 


 
Step 1: Launch the Chrome browser and click on the three dots on the top right corner.
 
Step 2: From the dropdown menu, click on More Tools and then choose Clear browsing data.
 
Step 3: Select the time range and then choose what you want to delete and click on Clear Data.
 
Microsoft Edge
 
Step 1: Launch Microsoft Edge and click on the three dots on the top right corner.
 
Step 2: From the menu, click on History and further select precise browsing data.
 
Step 3:  Select the time range and the data you want to be erased and click on Clear Now.
 
Firefox
 
Step 1: Open Firefox and click on the hamburger menu on the top right.
 
Step 2: First click on Library and then click on History. Now choose Clear recent history.
 
Step 3: Click on time range and choose Clear Now.
 
#### How to Clear Cookies from Browsers using a Software?
 
It is quite convenient to use optimizing software and clear all the cookies and cache files in one go. This will help clean and maintain the system and fix any errors along with HTTP 400 Bad Request error. I have been using Advanced System Optimizer for a couple of years and have always found my computer to be in top speed with enhanced performance. The ASO is fantastic software and has the following features:
 
- System Cleaner – Advanced System Optimizer facilitates cleaning junk, temporary and obsolete files from the PC and guarantees a faster system and more storage space.
 - Ensures Security and Privacy – ASO helps in securing the computer by defending against malware, virus, spyware and other harmful entities. It also maintains privacy on the PC by removing surfing cookies, history, cache etc. so that your surfing events cannot be tracked.
 - Optimizing Windows OS– This software augments various aspects of the system like Game optimization that lets you have an extraordinary experience each time you play and Memory optimization, which clears your RAM.
 - Drivers Updates – ASO updates system drivers frequently.
 - Backup & Recovery – It also aids in taking backup, and store it in a secured medium to be restored in cases of mishaps like hard drive crashes. Advanced System Optimizer takes a backup and can return your files as they were.

 
### Fix 3: Check The URL.
 
One of the common reasons on a large scale for the HTTP 400 bad request error is due to the incorrect URL. The URL includes spellings, spaces, paths etc. which must be checked and confirmed. Only a correct address will lead to the proper webpage.
 
### Fix 4: Log Out And Log In Again
 
There are a few websites that support user authentication. This means the user must sign in every time he/she visits the site. If you remain signed in for an extended time, then time can sometimes generate HTTP 400 bad request error due to strings from other past sessions. The solution would then be to remove the cookies containing the login information by logging out once and signing back in.
 
### Fix 5: Recent Installations
 
Check your system for any recent app installations including extensions on your browsers. Due to lack of compatibility, the 400 HTTP bad request issues often occur and can be fixed by removing the extension, add-on or application causing this. There is no precise method to ascertain the app but can be identified by removing each newly installed app, one by one. This is also known as the trial and error method.
 
### Fix 6: Reset The Browser
 
The final option to resolve this error is to reset the browser, which means you will lose all the saved passwords and settings. However, your bookmarks will stay intact.
 
To reset Chrome, follow these steps:
 
Step 1: Launch Chrome and click on the three dots on the top right corner.
 
Step 2: Click on Settings and scroll down and click on Advanced.
 
Step 3: Once the Advanced menu opens up further, click on Reset and Clean Up.
 
Step 4: Click on Restore settings to their original defaults and then click on Reset Settings.
 
To reset Microsoft Edge, use these steps:
 
Step 1: Open Microsoft Edge browser and click on the three dots on the top right corner.
 
Step 2: Click on Settings and on the left pane options, locate Reset Settings and click on it.
 
Step 3: Then Click on the Reset button on the prompt that appears.
 
To reset Firefox, check these steps:
 
Step 1: Launch Firefox browser and click on the hamburger menu on the top right corner.
 
Step 2: Click on the Help option and then choose Troubleshooting Information.
 
Step 3: In the new tab, click on Refresh Firefox button on the left side of this tab.
