Title: MacBook Pro Owners Beware: Backlight Leak Disaster Strikes Due to Common Dent - Costly Repair Charge Revealed!

Introduction
MacBook Pro is one of the most popular laptops available in the market today. It is known for its sleek design, impressive user experience and incredible performance. However, MacBook Pro owners recently experienced a nightmare due to a common dent which caused backlight leak disaster. In this article, we will cover the details of this disaster, the cause, and repair costs associated with this issue.

What is Backlight Leak?
The backlight is the source of illumination for the display screen of a laptop. Backlight is present in most laptops, including MacBook Pro. Over time, it is possible that the backlight system of your laptop may develop faults, leading to an uneven illumination of the screen. This issue is referred to as backlight leak.

What Causes Backlight Leak?
Backlight leak is caused by several reasons, including physical damage to the laptop. For MacBook Pro owners, the most common cause of backlight leak is a broken or dented display. This damage causes pressure on the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) of the laptop, leading to backlight leak.

What Happened to MacBook Pro Owners?
Recently, MacBook Pro owners reported a widespread problem of backlight leak. This issue was caused by a common dent on the display of their laptop. The dent was caused due to normal usage of the laptop, such as carrying it around in a bag or backpack. The dent caused pressure on the LCD, which ultimately led to backlight leak.

What is the Costly Repair Charge?
The repair charge for this issue is quite high. The reason is that backlight leak cannot be repaired. The only way to solve this issue is to replace the entire display. This means that MacBook Pro owners are looking at a bill of over $700 for the display replacement alone. It is worth noting that this price does not include any additional fees, such as labor or shipping costs.

Conclusion
If you are a MacBook Pro owner, the backlight leak disaster due to a common dent is something you need to be aware of. It is crucial to handle your laptop with extreme care and avoid any damage to the display. If your laptop develops this issue, the repair cost is substantial, and you need to prepare for the high expenses. We hope that this article has provided a useful insight into this issue and helps you take necessary precautions to protect your MacBook Pro.

## Chosen Solution
 My 8-month-old mac accidentally fell on the floor. It now leaks backlight at the bottom left corner (which has a dent from the fall). What are my options if I want to get it repaired (pricing and repair shops)? Is it just cosmetic or can have major issues down the road? I have come across a similar post but it is from 2017, hence posted this to get recommendations on when I should repair this (from third parties) and if there are any additional insights.

Apple designed the lid so it really can’t be taken apart without breaking it and the discreet parts are not available. This forces you to replace the entire lid assembly for any issues with it.
