It is a pre-set password that the user must change for security reasons. Default passwords are often easy to guess, and many malicious individuals use them to gain access to devices connected to the internet. Once someone has access to your router and network, they can easily access your personal information, monitor your online activity, and even steal your identity.

However, many people forget to change it afterward, which leads to a security breach that puts their personal information at risk.

If you own a Linksys Wrt160N router and haven't changed the default password, your router is at risk. Anyone with knowledge of the default password can access your network and compromise your security. It is essential to change the default password for your router as soon as possible. Changing the router password is easy to do and can protect you from malicious attacks.

To change the password for your Linksys Wrt160N router, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and type in your router's IP address (usually 192.168.1.1) into the address bar.

Changing your router's password is a simple but effective step in protecting your security. It is also essential to use a strong password that cannot easily be guessed by anyone. Once you have changed your router's password, you should also update your network's name and password to something unique and difficult to guess.

When the default password for a router no longer works, it most likely means that the password has been changed to something else, probably something much more secure. The default password for the WRT160N router is way too easy for anyone to guess, which is probably why it was changed.

The good thing is that you can just reset the router back to its default settings to restore the default password and log in with admin.

 

Here's how to reset the Linksys WRT160N router:

 
- Make sure the router is plugged in and powered on, and then turn it around to its back side where the cables are connected.
 - Press and hold down the Reset button for 5-10 seconds with something small and sharp like a paperclip.
 - Wait 30 seconds for the router to fully reset.
 - Unplug the power cable from the back of the router for just a few seconds and then reattach it.
 - Wait another 30 seconds for it to power back on and finish starting up.
 - Now that the router has been reset, you can log in at the http://192.168.1.1 address using the admin password.
 - Remember to change the router password to something more secure now that it's been restored to admin (set a new password from the Administration tab’s Management screen). You can store it in a password manager to make sure you don't ever lose it.

 

At this point, after having reset the WRT160N router, you have to reenter any customizations that you had before the reset. For example, wireless network settings like the SSID and password will have to be re-entered, as will any custom DNS servers, etc.
