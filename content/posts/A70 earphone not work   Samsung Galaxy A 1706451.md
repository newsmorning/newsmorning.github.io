# Shocking Revelation: Samsung Galaxy A70 Earphone Fails to Work - Find Out Why

Samsung Galaxy A70 is one of the most popular mid-range smartphones in the market. The phone boasts of an impressive display, powerful battery, and a great camera, among other features. However, recent reports have emerged indicating that the Samsung Galaxy A70 earphones fail to work. This has left many users frustrated and wondering what could be the cause. In this article, we delve into the possible reasons why this is happening.

## Problematic Software Update

Software updates can be beneficial to smartphones as they bring new features and security patches to fix bugs. However, they can also cause issues with your device, including your earphones. Samsung Galaxy A70 users have reported that the earphones stopped working after updating the phone's software. This could be an indication that the software update was not properly configured, resulting in compatibility issues between the earphones and the updated software.

## Loose Connection

Another possible cause of failure in the Samsung Galaxy A70 earphones is a loose connection. This happens when the earphones are not properly connected to the phone. The connection problem could be due to misuse or damage to the earphone jack or connector. The issue could also be due to a manufacturing defect.

## Audio Jack Issue

In some cases, the audio jack in the Samsung Galaxy A70 may malfunction, leading to earphone failure. This issue is common in many smartphones, and it happens when the audio jack gets dirty or damaged, leading to poor contact between it and the earphone connector.

## Compatibility with Third-Party Earphones

Samsung Galaxy A70 users have also reported that their earphones work with third-party earphones but not with Samsung-branded earphones. This issue could be due to compatibility issues between the earphones and the smartphone. It could also be due to a manufacturing problem on the part of Samsung.

## Possible Solutions

The good news is that the failure of the Samsung Galaxy A70 earphones can be easily fixed. If the issue is with the software update, you can try rolling back to the previous software version. You can also try restarting your phone, disconnecting and reconnecting the earphones, or cleaning the audio jack to improve contact. In case the issue persists, you can reach out to Samsung customer service for assistance.

In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy A70 earphone failure could be caused by a variety of reasons, including problematic software updates, loose connections, audio jack issues, and compatibility problems with third-party earphones. If you encounter this issue, try troubleshooting using the above tips or contacting Samsung customer service for help.

## Chosen Solution
 The earphone on my A70 does not work after I replaced the screen. It tried to put everything back to the old screen but it does not work anymore. 
Do you know whatâ€™s wrong with it? Thank you.

 @vqviet it is my understanding the the A70 has the headphone jack on the PBA board that has the charging port on it as well. I suggest you replace that and see what you get. Something like this should work. Of course if yours looks different etc. post some good pictures of your boards with your QUESTION so we can see what you see.
