# Say Goodbye to Double Typing Woes: 5 Proven Ways to Fix Your Keyboard in Windows 11!

Windows 11 is the new operating system from Microsoft that brings some fantastic features and updates to its users. However, despite all these improvements, some users may still face some annoying bugs and glitches with their keyboards, particularly the double typing issue. This problem occurs when you strike a single key once, but it registers twice or more, making typing a frustrating experience. Don't worry, though! In this article, we'll be discussing some proven ways to fix the double typing issue on Windows 11:

## 1. Update Your Keyboard Drivers

The first step towards fixing any issue related to your keyboard is to update its drivers. You can either do it manually or use a third-party driver updater software. Go to your keyboard manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers compatible with Windows 11. Once downloaded, install them and see if the double typing problem persists.

## 2. Adjust Your Keyboard Settings

Another way to fix the double typing issue is to adjust your keyboard settings. Go to "Settings" > "Devices" > "Typing" and then scroll down to the "Hardware keyboard" section. Here, you'll find the "Repeat delay" and "Repeat rate" options. Adjust them according to your preference, and the issue may disappear.

## 3. Change Your Keyboard Language

Sometimes, the keyboard language setting could be the culprit behind the double typing issue. If you have multiple languages installed, try switching to another one and check if the problem is still there. To do this, go to "Settings" > "Time & Language" > "Language" and then select the language you want to use.

## 4. Use the On-Screen Keyboard

If none of the above methods work, you can switch to using the On-screen keyboard until you resolve the issue. To do this, go to "Settings" > "Ease of Access" > "Keyboard" and then turn on the "On-Screen Keyboard" option. It may not be an ideal solution, but it will get the job done until you fix the double typing problem.

## 5. Check for Hardware Issues

If you've tried all the software-related solutions on this list, it's time to check your hardware. Sometimes, the double typing issue could be caused by a faulty keyboard or loose connections. You may need to replace your keyboard or take it to a specialist for repairs.

In conclusion, the double typing issue is undoubtedly frustrating, but don't let it dampen your Windows 11 experience. Try these five proven ways to fix your keyboard, and you'll be back to smooth sailing in no time.
