Title: Shocking: LG TV turns grey and leaves owners in the dark - You won't believe what caused it!

Introduction

Recently, LG TV customers were left shocked and disappointed when their TV screens suddenly turned grey, leaving them in the dark. The sudden occurrence of this issue led to widespread concern and outrage among LG customers worldwide.

After extensive research, it was discovered that the root cause of this issue was related to the manufacturing defect of the LED backlight strips, which resulted in the grey screen issues. LG has since acknowledged the issue and offered a solution, but the damage had already been done.

What Is The Issue?

The grey-screen issue began with the appearance of a small grey line on the screen, which eventually spread to the entire screen. The issue occurred mostly in the LG LED TV models that had failed LED backlight strips. The exact reason for the manufacturing defect of the LED strips remains unknown.

The grey screen issue not only affected the picture quality but also made the TV useless, as it became impossible to watch anything.

What Caused The Issue?

The root cause of the grey screen issue in the LG TV was a manufacturing defect in the LED backlight strips. The malfunction of these strips led to the entire screen turning grey, distorting the image and rendering the TV useless.

LG later acknowledged the issue and offered customers a replacement of the defective parts that caused the screen to turn grey.

How LG Responded

After LG acknowledged the issue, they offered customers who had purchased the affected TV models with replacements for the faulty LED backlight strips that caused the grey screen issue. LG also offered a software update that would improve the performance of the TV.

LG has tried to make amends for the defect by issuing a formal apology and offering a solution to the affected customers, but the damage has already been done. The grey screen issue caused a significant loss of trust for LG among its customers.

Conclusion

The grey screen issue experienced by LG customers is a manufacturing defect that has caused a great deal of frustration and financial loss for many. While LG acknowledged the issue and offered a replacement for the defective LED backlight strips, the customers have already suffered through the inconvenience of dealing with it.

It is important for all electronic product manufacturers to be more careful in their manufacturing processes and put in place measures to ensure that such manufacturing defects do not occur in the future. This will restore customer confidence and prevent such issues from recurring in the future.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi I am really confused on my TV’s problem it’s a LG 55 inch cinema 3D picture (model number 55LM4600) I was watching Netflix on my fire stick and then the screen fadded grey and is now a dark grey screen  and the sound works on it. The grey screen makes me think the light in the TV is still good but there is no picture at all.

 @naalii that sounds like a main board issue. You need to try all different inputs and see if that changes anything. You also want to check if your on-screen menu still shows. Let us know what you get with that. Ultimately you need to take a look at the boards on the inside of your TV. Unplug it, remove the back and take a look. See if you can identify some obvious damage like leaking or domed looking capacitors etc. Take some pictures of your boards and post those with your question so we can see what you see. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that.

 i had this problem but the solution is very easy, use your remote control, go to settings. then go to set to factory settings. that is it.
Mr. Abdel-Hamid

 Just change your HDMI settings.  I accidently changed my tv input via my remote to another HDMI outlet…3 unstead of 1……that did it for me.

 I Have the Same Problem & got it Checked.
Technician Said it is Display problem & I will have to replace it. When I asked the cost he said, 26000.
I do not know what to do now.
