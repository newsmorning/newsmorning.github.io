# Unleash the Night with these 5 Simple Tricks for Dark Mode on Opera GX - Your Favorite Websites Will Never Be the Same!

Are you tired of using your favorite websites in bright, eye-straining white? Do you wish you could browse the web late at night without feeling like you're staring at the sun? Opera GX, the gaming browser with various aesthetic and functional features, has the solution for you - Dark Mode! With Dark Mode, you can reduce the amount of blue light emitted by your device's screen, which can disrupt your sleep cycle, and enjoy a sleek and stylish browsing experience.

However, enabling Dark Mode on Opera GX is just the first step - there's much more you can do to customize this feature to your liking. In this article, we'll show you five simple but effective tricks to unleash the night with Dark Mode on Opera GX and make your favorite websites truly unforgettable.


## 1. Enable Dark Mode for All Websites

By default, Dark Mode on Opera GX only applies to a limited number of websites that support it. However, you can force Dark Mode on every website you visit by using a neat little trick.

First, go to the **Settings** menu by clicking on the three dots on the top-right corner of the browser window. Then, select **Appearance** and scroll down to the **Force Dark Mode for Web Contents** option. Turn it on, and voila - every website you visit will now have a dark background and light texts by default, unless they explicitly forbid it. This trick can be a lifesaver for those who like to browse lesser-known websites or their own personal blogs, which may not have a Dark Mode option.


## 2. Customize Dark Mode Colors

While Dark Mode on Opera GX looks great on its own, you may want to tweak its colors to your liking. Fortunately, Opera GX allows you to change the color schemes of Dark Mode easily.

To do this, go back to **Settings > Appearance** and scroll down to the **Customize Your Theme** option. Here, you can choose from several preset color schemes, such as "Midnight Purple" or "Neon Green," or create your own by adjusting the hue, saturation, and brightness of the background, foreground, and accent colors. You can even import color schemes created by the Opera GX community or export your own for others to use.


## 3. Adjust Dark Mode Contrast

Depending on your device's screen and lighting conditions, Dark Mode on Opera GX may not be as easy to read as you'd like. If this is the case, you can adjust the contrast of Dark Mode to make it more comfortable for your eyes.

Go to **Settings > Appearance** again and scroll down to the **Adjust Contrast** option. Here, you can slide the bar left or right to decrease or increase the difference between the background and the text. You can also test your contrast settings on a sample text before applying them to the entire browser.


## 4. Schedule Dark Mode

If you don't want to manually turn on or off Dark Mode every time you browse the web, you can set a schedule to do it for you automatically.

In **Settings > Appearance**, scroll down to the **Scheduled Themes** option and turn on the **Enable Scheduled Themes** toggle. Then, click **Add Schedule** and select the days and times you want Dark Mode to be enabled or disabled. You can set different schedules for individual days or groups of days, such as weekends or working days. This feature can be helpful for people who switch between day and night shifts or have irregular sleep patterns.


## 5. Use Sidebar Shortcuts

Finally, you can access and toggle Dark Mode on Opera GX even faster by using the sidebar shortcuts.

Press the **F4** key or click the **GX Corner** icon on the left-hand side of the browser window to open the sidebar. From there, you can click the **Dark Mode** toggle to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode, as well as use other handy shortcuts such as opening the Task Manager, controlling the music player, or checking the network connection. The sidebar shortcuts can save you a lot of time and hassle, especially if you use Opera GX frequently.


With these five simple tricks, you can take Dark Mode on Opera GX to the next level and enjoy a truly immersive and comfortable browsing experience. Whether you're a night owl, a gamer, or just a fan of cool browser features, Opera GX has got you covered. Try it out for yourself and see how much better your favorite websites can look and feel!
