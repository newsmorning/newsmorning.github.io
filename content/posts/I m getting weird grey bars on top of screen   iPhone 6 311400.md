A recent phenomenon affecting iPhone 6 users worldwide has left many in shock - strange grey bars appearing on their screens. What's causing this, and is there a solution? Let's find out.

The first reports of the grey bar issue appeared on Apple's support forums in late 2021. Users described seeing a grey bar appear at the top of their screens, which gradually spread down to cover the entire display. In some cases, the bars were accompanied by flickering or screen distortion.

So what's causing this bizarre phenomenon? According to Apple, the issue is caused by a hardware defect in the iPhone 6's display. The company has offered to replace affected devices free of charge for users with AppleCare coverage or those within the warranty period. Unfortunately, for those whose devices are outside the warranty period, the repair costs can run into hundreds of dollars.

But why is this happening specifically to iPhone 6 users? The answer lies in the way the device and its components were built. The iPhone 6 was manufactured with a new type of display technology called "in-cell," which allowed for a thinner and lighter design. However, this technology also made the display more susceptible to damage from drops or impacts.

Over time, the repeated stress on the iPhone 6's display can cause the hardware defect that leads to the grey bar issue. This means that even if your iPhone 6 hasn't suffered a major drop or impact, you could still be at risk.

But fear not, there are steps you can take to prevent the grey bar issue from occurring or worsening. Avoid dropping or subjecting your iPhone 6 to impacts or high levels of pressure. Invest in a protective case or screen protector to minimize the risk of damage.

If you are already experiencing the grey bar issue, the best course of action is to contact Apple's customer support. They will be able to assist with troubleshooting or repair options, depending on your device's warranty status.

In conclusion, the grey bar issue affecting iPhone 6 users is a hardware defect caused by repeated stress on the device's display. While Apple has offered to replace affected devices for free, those outside the warranty period will need to pay for repairs. Prevention is key, and users should take steps to protect their devices from drops and impacts to avoid the issue altogether. If you are already experiencing the issue, contact Apple for assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently replaced the microphone, charging section of an iPhone 6 4.7. Upon placing the screen back on, I received odd grey bars that extend to just below the clock and battery indicator. What could this be?

 Remove the screen, remove the connectors from the motherboard, sounds like one of the connectors is not attached correctly. When you connect those connectors they should make a click sounds just like putting Legos together. Put everything back together and you should be all good.

 Does the screen sit properly in the case?  What does the bar when you touch the glass with little (!!!) pressure of your finger?
