Unlock the Secret to a Brighter Screen! Learn How to Easily Replace the Backlight on Your Lenovo Ideapad P400

If you own a Lenovo Ideapad P400 and have noticed that the screen isn't as bright as it used to be, you may need to replace the backlight. Luckily, this is a relatively simple task that can be done at home. This article will guide you through the process of replacing the backlight on your Lenovo Ideapad P400.

Before you start:

Before you begin, make sure you have a replacement backlight compatible with your Lenovo Ideapad P400. You can find these online for a reasonable price. Also, ensure that you have a Phillips screwdriver, and a flathead screwdriver.

Step 1 - Remove the battery:

First, turn off your Lenovo Ideapad P400 and unplug it from any power source. Remove the battery by sliding the switch in the direction of the unlock icon and lifting the battery out of your laptop.

Step 2 - Remove the front bezel:

Locate the screws on the front bezel of your Lenovo Ideapad P400. They are located at the bottom of the bezel, and there may also be some screws underneath the rubber feet. Unscrew them with your Phillips screwdriver.

Next, carefully remove the front bezel from your screen. You can use your flathead screwdriver to pry it away from the screen.

Step 3 - Unplug the backlight cable:

Locate the backlight cable, which will be located at the bottom of the screen. Carefully unplug this from the motherboard.

Step 4 - Remove the old backlight:

Using your flathead screwdriver, carefully remove the old backlight from the screen.

Step 5 - Install the new backlight:

Insert the new backlight into the same place where the old backlight was. Use your flathead screwdriver to secure it in place.

Step 6 - Reconnect the backlight cable:

Reconnect the backlight cable to the motherboard, ensuring it is securely in place.

Step 7 - Reassemble your Lenovo Ideapad P400:

Place the front bezel back onto your Lenovo Ideapad P400 and secure it with the screws you removed earlier. Replace the battery and turn on your laptop. You should see a brighter and clearer screen now that you have replaced the backlight.

Conclusion:

While replacing a backlight may sound daunting, it's a relatively simple process that you can do at home, even without much tech expertise. With this step-by-step guide on how to replace the backlight on your Lenovo Ideapad P400, you'll be able to unlock the secret to a brighter screen in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 The backlight on my  Lenovo Laptop 20211 is out, could someone please instruct me on the procedures of replacing this light.
Thanks in advance!

 Hi @combatman ,
I assume that you have proved that the backlighting is faulty by either using an external monitor or shining a torch at an angle close to the screen to see if the images are still there.
If this is the case, then the backlighting LEDs may not be faulty, it may rather be either a faulty lid switch, a faulty LCD cable (or cable connections at either end) that supplies the power to the backlighting in the LCD screen or it could be a faulty screen as well, (the lights are integrated into the screen).
The lid switch (not mentioned in the manual) is usually a magnetically operated switch, with the magnet in the lid and the switch in the body, that either disconnects the backlight power when operated OR that  sends a signal to the BIOS to switch off the backlight power by software control.
You may have to open the laptop to find the problem
Here is a link to the service manual for a Lenovo Z400/P500/Z500. I cannot find a manual for a P400- this manual is from the Lenovo website for a P400 but does not mention it in the manual. As best as I can find out the only difference between a P400 (20211) and a Z400  is the screen resolution, 1600 x 900 vs. 1366 x 768 but this may be wrong.
