You Won't Believe What Happened After This iPhone XR Screen Replacement - Say Goodbye to Your Camera's Back Light!

If you're an iPhone XR user, you know how important a fully functioning camera is to capture beautiful images and memories. But what happens when your iPhone's screen cracks or becomes unresponsive? You might be thinking about getting a screen replacement, but did you know that this simple solution could potentially harm your camera's back light?

Recently, some iPhone XR users have reported that their camera's back light stopped working after getting a screen replacement. This issue can happen because the back light is located behind the screen, and when someone replaces the screen improperly, they might damage the wires that connect to the back light. This results in the camera's back light becoming non-functional.

However, this issue can be avoided by taking some precautions while getting your iPhone XR screen replaced. Here are some important steps you need to follow to ensure that your camera's back light won't be damaged:

1. Choose a Reliable Repair Service:

The first and most important step is to choose a reliable repair service. Make sure to read reviews online or ask for recommendations from your friends or family to find a reputable repair service that has experienced technicians and uses high-quality replacement parts.

2. Ask for the Warranty:

When you're getting your screen replaced, ask the repair service if they offer any kind of warranty or guarantee. Most reputable repair services provide a warranty for their services, which means that if anything goes wrong, they will fix it free of cost.

3. Check the Replacement Parts:

Before the repair begins, make sure to see the replacement parts that the repair service will be using. Check if the parts are genuine, high-quality, and compatible with your iPhone XR model.

4. Test the Camera After Repair:

Once the repair is complete, test your iPhone XR camera to see if everything is working correctly. Take some pictures and videos with the flash on and off to ensure that the camera's back light is functioning correctly.

In conclusion, getting a screen replacement for your iPhone XR can be a nerve-wracking experience, but you can make it easier by being cautious and following the steps mentioned above. By choosing the right repair service and testing your camera after repair, you can ensure that your camera's back light won't be damaged, and you can continue to capture beautiful and memorable moments without any issues.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey all, My customer got her screen done by someone else and now her back camera and her flashlight do not work. Iâ€™m trying to think what it could be as he would have had no reason to unplug the flex with the flashlight on and the guy she went too is quite skilled. Any idea all?

 I believe the flashlight flex is the power button flex. It sounds like maybe something got knocked off near the flashlight ic or the flashlight ic was damaged or loosened. Did she drop it before the screen was replaced? My guess is the damage came from the occurrence that damaged the screen at the same time the back camera and flashlight stopped working. I doubt that they checked to see if the camera was working with a damaged screen.  Just a thought
