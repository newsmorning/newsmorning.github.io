Is Your HTC One M8 Buzzing Non-Stop After a Battery Change? Here's the Surprising Reason Why!

If you're an owner of a HTC One M8 and have recently changed its battery, you may have encountered an issue where the phone constantly emits a buzzing or vibrating noise, even when there's no call or notification on it. It's a puzzling problem that may leave you wondering if you've accidentally damaged the device or if there's a deeper issue that needs resolving. The good news is that there's actually an easy and surprising fix to this problem. 

The root of the buzzing problem lies in a certain component inside the HTC One M8 called the NFC antenna. NFC stands for Near Field Communication, a technology that allows the phone to wirelessly communicate with other devices through electromagnetic induction. It's commonly used for contactless payment systems, Bluetooth pairing, and other convenient functions. However, the NFC antenna can also cause problems with the phone's normal functions if it's not calibrated correctly. 

When you change the battery of the HTC One M8, the NFC antenna may lose its calibration due to the change of power source. This can lead to the buzzing or vibrating noise that you're experiencing. Fortunately, the solution is rather simple. 

To fix the buzzing problem, you need to re-calibrate the NFC antenna of your HTC One M8. Here are the steps you need to follow: 

1. Go to the Settings of your HTC One M8. 
2. Scroll down and tap on the "More" option under the Wireless & networks section. 
3. Look for the "NFC" option and toggle it off. 
4. Wait for a few seconds, then toggle the NFC back on. 
5. Restart your HTC One M8. 

After you've completed these steps, your HTC One M8 should stop making the buzzing or vibrating noise. The reason for this is that turning off and on the NFC essentially recalibrates the NFC antenna, allowing it to function properly again. Additionally, the phone's cache is cleared when you restart it, which can also resolve any lingering issues with the NFC calibration. 

It's worth noting that not all HTC One M8 units are affected by this issue, but it's not uncommon to encounter it after a battery change. If you've tried other troubleshooting methods and failed to resolve the buzzing problem, it's worth giving this fix a try before resorting to more drastic measures like a factory reset or a professional repair. 

In conclusion, if your HTC One M8 is buzzing or vibrating non-stop after a battery change, don't worry too much. It's likely just the NFC antenna needing recalibration. Follow the simple steps outlined above and you'll be back to enjoying a fully-functional device in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I just replaced my HTC One M8's battery and charging port. When I put the phone back together the screen remains blank. I can feel the device responding to touch but the backlight does not function now. I disabled the phone 2 more times thinking I had missed a connection but without good luck. The bad luck came on the 3rd attempt,, when I reconnected the battery lead to the battery the phone vibrates, constantly. I assume now there's a short in that circuit. Any ideas?

 Did you turn the phone off before disconnecting the battery? Did you disconnect anything else before disconnecting the battery? On some phones, disconnecting the LCD before disconnecting the battery burns a backlight filter or two, or even other components related to the LCD.
