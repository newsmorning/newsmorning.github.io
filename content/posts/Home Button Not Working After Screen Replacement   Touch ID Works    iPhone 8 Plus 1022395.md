Have you ever damaged your iPhone screen and thought about replacing it by yourself? Well, I did and let me tell you, it was quite an experience. I had an iPhone 8 Plus with a cracked screen for a while, and one day I decided to replace it on my own. I followed a DIY tutorial and it seemed pretty simple until I realized that something was not working properly. 
 
After successfully replacing the screen, my iPhone’s Touch ID stopped working. I tried everything I could think of to get it working again, but nothing worked. Finally, I realized that the home button connectors underneath the screen were damaged during the replacement process, which was preventing the Touch ID from working.
 
Although it was disappointing that the Touch ID feature wasn't working anymore, I was still happy with myself for attempting the repair. However, the worst was yet to come when I realized that the home button wasn't working either. The only option now was to use the on-screen button instead of the physical one I was used to.
 
For those who do not know, the iPhone 8 Plus has a solid-state home button. So, if the home button flex cable gets damaged, the home button stops working altogether. To enter the passcode and open the phone, I had to swipe up from the bottom of the screen, which was annoying, to say the least. I realized how much I relied on the physical home button to interact with my phone.
 
It was a valuable lesson learned which taught me that sometimes, it’s better to leave some things to the professionals. Sure, it might have saved me some money by replacing the screen on my own, but I ended up damaging the phone even further. I should have taken it to a technician who would have fixed it without causing any additional damage.
 
In conclusion, when it comes to repairing your iPhone or any other electronic devices, it is always better to rely on professionals rather than attempting repairs on your own. Although DIY tutorials make it seem simple, there is a high risk of damaging the device even further, just like I did with my iPhone. So, learn from my mistake and save yourself the trouble by trusting the experts with your valuable devices.

 Hi iFixit!
I repaired an iPhone 8+ screen for my customer , after repair the home button no longer works however it does still work for Touch ID functionality. I have removed and reinstalled the home button and checked all connections - it does this on multiple screens so it isn't a problem with the LCD replacement. I have not over tightened the screws either on the home button bracket which I've read can cause some issues with the home button not working.
The customer also says that the home button "doesn't feel like it's seated right" however I have removed it several times and re-fitted and can't see any other way that it would fit.
Wondered if you had any ideas? I have already tried the suggestions on the following thread including a hard reset.
iPhone 8 plus home button not "clicking" after screen replacement..
Have explained to the customer I can replace the home button to restore click functionality at the expense of losing the Touch ID functionality ……. but would rather fix it properly.
Fairly sure I haven’t damaged the home button flex (this phone has been repaired several times) - Surely if the flex was damaged the Touch ID wouldn’t still work?
Would appreciate any suggestions on this one!

 It sounds like the turtle IC on the home button assembly has become faulty. I use to try and reflow or replace them but now I am advising customers to get apple to replace the screen and home button. If you have a business near you that offers microsoldering you could see if they could help but a lot of them have stopped doing this repair.

 The same just happened to me. I just found one proper explanation for it in this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDVnp90a...). Basically, that one screw that goes over the Home button should not be tightened too much. As far as I understood, so that the metal plate doesn't bend (which it did for me).
