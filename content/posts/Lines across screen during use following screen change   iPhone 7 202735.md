Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed My iPhone 7 Screen – Lines Appeared Across the Screen!

As an iPhone 7 owner, it was a matter of time before I had to replace the screen. And so, when my screen broke, I decided to go ahead and get it replaced. Little did I know, that decision would lead to an unexpected outcome.

When I received my phone, I was thrilled. The scuffed and broken screen was replaced, and it looked brand new. I couldn't wait to use it again, but as soon as I unlocked my phone and tried to use it, I noticed something strange. Thin, bright lines flickered across the screen, almost like static on a TV.

I was confused and disappointed. I tried restarting the phone, but the lines didn't go away. I even tried resetting the phone, but the lines persisted. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to get it fixed before the problem got worse.

I went back to the repair shop, and they assured me that they would fix it as soon as possible. However, they didn't tell me what caused the problem, leaving me in the dark. I didn't want to wait for them to fix it, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.

I started searching online for solutions, and after a bit of digging, I found out that the problem was caused by a faulty screen replacement. Apparently, that was a common problem that iPhone users faced when getting their screens replaced.

I was shocked but relieved that I finally knew what went wrong. I quickly found a reputable repair shop that specialized in iPhone repairs and had my phone fixed there. The lines disappeared, and my phone worked like a charm again.

In hindsight, getting my iPhone 7 screen replaced was a mistake. However, I learned a valuable lesson about being careful when choosing a repair shop for phone repairs. I highly recommend doing your due diligence before taking your phone to a repair shop to avoid such incidents from occurring.

In conclusion, changing an iPhone 7 screen may sound easy, and it may seem that anyone can do it. However, you need to make sure that your phone's screen is replaced by a professional repair shop to avoid damaging your phone or getting a faulty screen replacement. It's essential to choose a reputable repair shop that has a track record of successful repairs to ensure that you get the best service possible.

 Hey Rob! That's quite the odd behavior! Usually that's a sign of the LCD connection being faulty, even if it's seated properly. I'd check the pins in the connections, both device side and display side. The thing to check for is dust/debris in the connection or bent pins. If everything looks pristine, and the device still behaves strangely, then I'd say it's an LCD issue deeper in the display, and you should seek replacement. Best of luck with your repair!
