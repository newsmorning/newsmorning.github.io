Dell has just unveiled the latest addition to its XPS 15 laptop series, which is the XPS 15 9570. That is an update of the 9560 model launched in 2017. The latest XPS 15 is a compact 15.6-inch laptop with some serious specifications.
 
The XPS 15 9570 might not look much different from the 9560 model. However, the big difference lies in the latest XPS 15’s Coffee Lake processor.
 
XPS 15 9570 incorporates a six-core Coffee Lake Intel CPU. The laptop’s three alternative configurations can include eighth gen i5, 17 and i9 processors with clock speeds of up to 4.1 Ghz.
 

 
The XPS 15 9570 also includes the latest GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU. That is a similar GPU to to the 9560’s GTX 1050, but the 1050 Ti has higher clock speeds. However, the GTX 1050 Ti is still not entirely a virtual reality ready GPU that you can utilize with headsets such as the Vive VR.
 
Aside from that, the latest XPS 15’s specifications are similar to the 9560 model. Like the 9560, the XPS 15 9570 has a 4K 3,840 x 2,160 resolution. However, the 9570 does boast a better contrast ratio of 1,500:1.
 
Storage specifications are also largely the same. The XPS 15 provides both HDD (hard disk drive) and SSD (solid-state drive) storage options for its users. The laptop’s maximum storage amounts to one TB HDD.
 
Another great thing about the XPS 15 is its battery. Dell claims that 97 Whr battery can last up to 21.5 hours with recharge. That is a decent battery for a high-resolution laptop.
 
With a new CPU and GPU, the latest Dell XPS 15 is a great multimedia laptop. The XPS 15 is expected to retail from $1,000 for its base models. You can preorder the laptop from April 16, and it will be more widely available in May.
