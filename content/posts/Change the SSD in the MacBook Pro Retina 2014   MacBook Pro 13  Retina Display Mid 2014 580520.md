# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Upgrade Your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Mid 2014 SSD!

Do you own a MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Mid 2014 and feel like your storage capacity is limited? Do you want to improve your Mac's performance and speed? Look no further! In this article, you will learn how to upgrade your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Mid 2014 SSD with just a few simple steps that even a non-expert can follow.

Before diving into the upgrade process, you should know that you won’t be able to upgrade the RAM of your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Mid 2014 as it is soldered to the logic board. However, upgrading your SSD, which is also known as your storage drive, is a great way to boost your Mac's performance.

**Step 1: Prep Work**

The first thing you should do before attempting to upgrade your MacBook Pro's SSD is backing up all the data on your Mac. You can use Apple's built-in Time Machine feature or any other third-party software that you trust.

After you've backed up your files and disconnected any external devices, shut down your MacBook Pro and remove the bottom case screws using a P5 Pentalobe screwdriver.

**Step 2: Locate and Remove the Old SSD**

Once you’ve removed the bottom case, you can see the MacBook Pro's logic board. Look for the SSD module and carefully disconnect the cable attached to it. You can use a spudger tool to gently pry the cable connector from its socket.

Remove the four screws that secure the SSD module to the logic board. The screws are small, so make sure you keep them in a safe place. Then, gently pull the old SSD module out of its slot.

**Step 3: Install the New SSD**

Now you can install the new SSD module. Align the SSD module with the slot and push it gently until it clicks into place. Be careful not to apply too much force as you could cause damage to the logic board.

Secure the SSD with the four screws that you removed earlier. Finally, reconnect the cable to the SSD module with the connector.

**Step 4: Reassemble Your MacBook Pro**

After you've securely installed the new SSD module, it's time to reassemble your MacBook Pro. Replace the bottom case and fasten the screws using your P5 Pentalobe screwdriver. Once you’ve put everything back together, power up your Mac.

**Step 5: Verify Your New SSD**

When your Mac is back up and running, you should check if the new SSD is properly installed. Click on the Apple logo on the top left corner of your Mac's screen and click “About This Mac”. Then click “System Report” and click “Storage” in the sidebar.

You will see the new SSD module listed in the list of storage devices. If it is not listed or you see any errors, you may need to double-check your installation.

Congratulations! You've successfully upgraded your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Mid 2014 SSD. Not only did you expand your storage capacity, but you also improved your Mac’s speed and performance.

In conclusion, upgrading your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Mid 2014 SSD is an easy and affordable way to improve your Mac's performance. All you need is a P5 Pentalobe screwdriver, a new SSD module, and a little bit of courage to open up your MacBook Pro. With this simple guide, you will be able to upgrade your Mac's SSD like a pro!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
Can we put in a MacBook Pro Retina 13" 2014 the SSD of the MacBook Pro Retina 15 Pouces 2015 ?

 Sadly, the SSD's are different. The newer 15" 2015 model uses a 4 lane PCIe device where as the older 13" 2014 model uses a 2 lane PCIe. They are not interchangeable.
