Introduction:
If you have recently undertaken a repair of your iPhone SE, you might have noticed that your home button is now dysfunctional, causing you to experience a lot of frustration. There are a lot of theories about why this could happen but this article will provide you with a shocking reason based on research and the experiences of others in the same situation. 

Background:
The home button is an essential component of any iPhone. It allows you to access your home screen, and it also doubles as a fingerprint scanner on newer models. When the home button malfunctions, you lose a lot of functionality on your phone, and it can be frustrating to say the least. Therefore, it is essential that any repair work done to your iPhone does not interfere with the home button's functionality. 

The Shocking Reason:
Now, for the shocking reason why your home button might be dysfunctional: it's because of the cables. Yes! Cables! The cables responsible for connecting the home button to the motherboard of your iPhone SE. During repair work, the repair technician might not have reconnected the cables securely or might have even damaged them in the process. This then leads to the home button malfunctioning. 

This might sound unbelievable, but it's not uncommon. The home button cables are delicate and easy to damage, and inexperienced technicians might not pay much attention to this. They might be more concerned with getting your phone repaired quickly and with little regard for the quality of workmanship. 

What Can You Do?
The first thing you need to do is to contact the repair technician and inform them of the issue. They might offer to repair the issue free of charge or might require you to pay a token for the additional service. If you cannot find the original repair technician, then go to an experienced professional repair center with a high success rate. Ensure that you do not attempt to fix it yourself unless you have the skills and knowledge to do so. 

Conclusion:
Repairing your iPhone SE can be a daunting task, and it's important to be cautious about whom you entrust your phone to. The shocking reason why your home button might be dysfunctional is due to the cables being damaged or not reconnected properly by inexperienced technicians. It's essential to contact the repair technician and inform them of the issue, and if this does not work, then contact an experienced professional repair center. Remember, if you cannot fix it, it's better to not make it worse.

## Chosen Solution
 Replaced lightning port and battery and now my home button doesn’t work. All other functionality seems fine. Battery is charging, upper buttons working, the home button cable is seating well. I don’t see any tears in the home button cable. Not sure what the issue is.

 There is a small chip on the home button cable which is very fragile and can easily crack when the home button is removed, I’m thinking thats what your issue is.
