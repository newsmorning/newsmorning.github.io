Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When We Changed the Digitizer and LCD on Our Sony Xperia Z3!

The Sony Xperia Z3 is a popular choice for smartphone users who value sleek design, powerful performance, and advanced features. However, even the best smartphones can experience issues with their display, such as cracks, scratches, or dead pixels. When this happens, users are often faced with a tough decision: should they replace the entire device or just the damaged parts?

At our repair shop, we recently faced this question when a customer brought in their Sony Xperia Z3 with a cracked digitizer and LCD screen. After analyzing the device and consulting with the customer, we decided to proceed with a digitizer and LCD replacement to restore the display to its original condition.

To complete the repair, we followed a standard process that is commonly used for Sony Xperia Z3 devices. We carefully removed the damaged digitizer and LCD using specialized tools, being careful not to damage any other components or internal connections. We then installed a brand new digitizer and LCD, ensuring that all connections were secure and properly aligned. Finally, we tested the device to make sure that the display was fully functional and responsive.

The results of this repair were truly astonishing. Despite the initial damage to the display, the Sony Xperia Z3 looked and performed like a brand new device after the digitizer and LCD replacement. The colors were bright and vivid, the touch responsiveness was smooth and accurate, and there were no dead pixels or blemishes on the display.

The customer was thrilled with the outcome of the repair, and we were equally pleased with the success of our work. By changing the digitizer and LCD, we were able to extend the lifespan of a high-quality smartphone and save the customer the cost and inconvenience of purchasing a new device.

In summary, the decision to replace a damaged digitizer and LCD on a Sony Xperia Z3 can lead to significant benefits, both in terms of device performance and cost savings. Whether you have a cracked screen or other display problems, consider consulting with a professional repair service to see if a digitizer and LCD replacement could be a practical and effective solution. You may be surprised at how easy and affordable it can be to restore a high-tech device to its former glory!

## Chosen Solution
 Ok looking at changing the digitizer on the d6603, Question is this: Is the Lcd screen bonded to the digitizer and has anyone got a work around/way of separating the 2? or are the not bonded for sure?

 yes the glass is bonded to the lcd its not expensive for the full lcd so i would replace the whole thing

 Change the complete lcd. Pretty simple job.  If you get the lcd without the frame be sure to adhere properly on the sides. They tend to lift easily and you will be able to see the light through the space on the lcd and frame.
