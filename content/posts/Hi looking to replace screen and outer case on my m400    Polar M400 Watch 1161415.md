With a few simple tweaks and some useful add-ons, you can transform your old Polar M400 into a brand new, fully-functional smartwatch!

Step 1: Install Custom Watch Faces 
One of the most significant limitations of the Polar M400 watch is its limited watch face options. However, the good news is that there are plenty of custom watch faces available on the internet that you can download and use instead. These custom watch faces come with a range of useful features, including different color themes, complications, and data fields. Some of the most popular watch face customization options for Polar M400 include Watch Face Generator and Watch Face-Uploader.

Step 2: Add Apps To Your Watch 
With the Polar M400, you're limited to just a few basic features and functionalities. However, you can expand the capabilities of your device by adding apps to it. You can download a range of apps that are specifically designed for the Polar M400 device, including fitness tracking apps, music streaming apps, and even video player apps. Installing apps on your old Polar M400 watch can help you transform it into a fully-functional smartwatch that does a lot more than just track your fitness.

Step 3: Connect It To Your Smartphone 
The Polar M400 device comes with Bluetooth connectivity, which means you can easily connect it to your smartphone. Once connected, you can receive notifications, control music playback, and even use voice assistants like Google Assistant and Siri on your old Polar M400 watch. That way, you don't have to pull out your phone every time you want to check a notification or change the music.

Step 4: Use A Fitness App 
One of the main reasons people buy smartwatches is so they can easily track their fitness activities. However, even an old Polar M400 watch can help you monitor your fitness effectively. By installing a fitness app like Endomondo or Strava, you can track your workouts, monitor your heart rate, and set goals for yourself. These apps also come with social features, so you can compete with your friends and share your progress with them.
