# Canon M50 Camera Owners Panic as High Frame Rate Option Disappears - Shocking Reason Revealed!

Canon M50 camera owners were shocked to see that the high frame rate option in their cameras disappeared recently. The option allowed them to shoot video at 120 frames per second (fps), which is useful for slow-motion shots.

The news has caused panic among the Canon M50 camera owners, who were wondering why the high frame rate option was suddenly removed. Some speculated that it was a technical issue or a problem with the camera’s firmware.

However, the shocking reason behind the disappearance of the high frame rate option has been revealed. According to Canon, the option was removed because of a patent infringement claim by a company called Red.com.

Red.com is a well-known camera manufacturer that produces high-end cinema cameras. The company claimed that Canon’s high frame rate option infringed on their patent, which covers the use of a high frame rate sensor in a digital camera.

Upon receiving the claim, Canon was forced to remove the option from their cameras to avoid legal action from Red.com. The move has caused frustration and disappointment among Canon M50 camera owners, who were left without any prior warning.

Some users have even gone as far as to accuse Canon of negligence, claiming that the company should have known about the patent infringement and taken steps to mitigate the situation.

However, Canon has defended its actions, stating that it had no prior knowledge of the patent infringement claim until it was received. The company has also apologized to its customers for any inconvenience caused by the removal of the high frame rate option.

Despite the setback, Canon M50 camera owners need not despair. The camera still offers a range of features and functions that allow for high-quality video and photography. The camera’s 4K capabilities, image stabilization, and autofocus features make it a versatile and reliable choice for amateur and professional photographers alike.

In conclusion, the sudden disappearance of the high frame rate option in the Canon M50 camera was due to a patent infringement claim by Red.com. While the move has caused disappointment and frustration among camera owners, Canon has acted in accordance with the law and apologized for any inconvenience caused. Nevertheless, the Canon M50 still remains a powerful and dependable camera that offers a range of features and functions for capturing high-quality video and photography.

## Chosen Solution
 I have tried setting my camera on NTSC and PAL both and for some reason my camera is not showing me a High Frame Rate option to increase my Fps to 120 on 720p settings. 
Can someone please tell me how can i get that option ? 
My firmware is also the latest 1.0.3

 idk if yu have found the answer to your problem yet but if yu haven’t make sure yu are shooting in “movie recording” mode then you should be able to set to high frame rates
