Introduction
If you’re a Windows 10 user, you know how important it is to work efficiently, but have you ever considered how much time you could save by utilizing keyboard shortcuts? While you may already know a few, we’re going to introduce you to eight insanely useful keyboard shortcuts for Windows 10 that you never knew you needed.

1. WIN + L
Do you have to step away from your computer frequently to attend meetings or run errands? Then, you’ll find this shortcut extremely useful. Pressing ‘WIN+L’ simultaneously locks your computer screen, keeping it safe and secure until you return.

2. ALT + TAB
Jumping between different applications and open windows is a breeze with this shortcut. To switch between them, press ‘ALT+ TAB.’ This shortcut helps you move easily and quickly between applications without wasting time using your mouse.

3. CTRL + SHIFT + T
Have you ever closed a tab accidentally that you weren’t done with? Thanks to this shortcut, you can quickly restore the closed tab by pressing ‘CTRL+SHIFT+T.’ Although you can also find this option by going to your browser history, using the keyboard shortcut is much faster.

4. WIN + D
Sometimes you need to hide everything quickly because someone is watching over your shoulder, or you need to take a quick break from work. ‘WIN+D’ instantly minimizes all windows and takes you to the desktop. Pressing it again restores all your open windows.

5. WIN + V
This shortcut lets you view items on your clipboard history. By pressing ‘WIN+V,’ you can access everything on the clipboard you’ve copied, pasted, or cut recently. It’s incredibly useful when you’re working with multiple documents and have to jump back and forth.

6. WIN + X
When you need access to several system-related tools, this shortcut is extremely helpful. Pressing ‘WIN + X’ displays a menu of various Windows settings and tools, including Control Panel, Task Manager, and PowerShell.

7. CTRL + Z
Who hasn’t made a mistake and wished they could “undo” it? Well, with this shortcut, you can! Pressing ‘CTRL+Z’ undoes your last action, whether it is typing, deleting, or formatting.

8. WINDOWS + PRINT SCREEN
Taking screenshots is one of the most common tasks we perform on computers. Instead of using third-party software, Windows 10 makes it much easier with this shortcut. Pressing ‘WINDOWS+ PRINT SCREEN’ captures and saves the screenshot to your Pictures folder for easy access later.

However, with Windows 10, you have to move your mouse around a lot to get to certain settings and screens. With keyboard shortcuts, you can instantly access features without all the mouse movements. Tell us what your favorite shortcuts are for Windows 10 in the comments.
 
### Windows Key + X
 
Back in Windows 8, this keyboard shortcut was really handy because the Start Menu was missing. In Windows 10, we have the Start Menu, but I still like this shortcut as it can quickly give me access to all the major tools for managing Windows.
 

 
These tools include the command prompt, elevated command prompt, network connections, task manager, power options, control panel, explorer, search, run, desktop and a couple of Administrative Tools like Computer Management, Disk Management and Device Manager.
 
### Windows Key + W
 
Windows + W will open up the Windows Ink Workspace dialog. With Windows 10 and the plethora of handheld and tablet devices running the OS, a lot more people are using pens with their Windows 10 devices.
 
Using this shortcut, you can quickly create a sticky note, open a new sketchpad or do a screen sketch. If you have a pen and a tablet device running Windows 10, this will be a great shortcut for working.
 
### Windows Key + Q/S
 
You can use either of these two keys to open up Cortana and the Windows search box. If you have a mic connected to your PC, you can press the key combo and start speaking in a question. You obviously have to enable Cortana first before the feature will work as described.
 
### Windows Key + 1, 2, 3, etc.
 
A nice new feature in Windows 10 is the ability to run a program that is on your taskbar by simply pressing the Windows key + a number. For example, here is my taskbar:
 
If I want to open an instance of Edge, all I have to do is press Windows key + 2 because Edge is the second icon on the taskbar. If I want to open Explorer, I would simply press Windows key + 3. Get the idea? If the program is already open, it will simply make that the active window.
 
### Windows Key + Comma (,)
 
If you’re working and have several windows open on the screen, but want to quickly see what’s on the desktop without having to switch to the desktop, then press Windows Key + Comma (,). It’s kind of like Aero Peek back in Windows 7; you can basically peek at the desktop while holding down the shortcut. Once you let go, you go back to the normal screen with all your windows.
 
### Windows Key + Period (.)
 
Right next to the comma is the period on most keyboards. If you do Windows key + ., you get a small dialog with a bunch of emojis! If you click on the emoji, it will insert it into currently active program.
 
I tested this in my browser and several apps and it worked great! You can throw them into your online chats, emails, notes, etc.
 
### Windows Key + P
 
Connecting your Windows 10 device to an external monitor or projector? Not a problem. Just press Windows Key + P and all your options pop up on the right hand side! You can duplicate the display, extend it or mirror it! Nice!
 
### Windows Key + PrtScn
 
Last, but not least, is Windows Key + PrtScn (PrintScreen). This will take a snapshot of whatever is on your screen and put it into the Photos app automatically.
 
So those are 8 more useful keyboard shortcuts that will help you navigate Windows 10 much faster and make it more enjoyable to use. Enjoy!
