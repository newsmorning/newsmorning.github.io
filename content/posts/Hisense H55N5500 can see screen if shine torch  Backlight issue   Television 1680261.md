If you are looking for a reasonably priced television, the Hisense H55N5500 is an excellent option. But a recent discovery has revealed a secret backlight issue that may shock you.

When watching television, most people do not pay too much attention to the backlight. But as it turns out, it plays a significant role in the image quality of your screen. Backlights are located behind the screen and illuminate the pixels to create the final image.

The discovery of a backlight issue on the Hisense H55N5500 came to light when people began to notice unusual patterns on the screen when a torch was shone on it. Many people have never thought to examine their TV screen in this way, which is why the discovery is so surprising.

When a torch is pointed at the screen, dark and light spots are visible on the screen. These spots are indicative of an uneven backlight. The problem affects edge-lit LED televisions like the Hisense H55N5500. This issue is a result of LED lights placed around the edges of the screen that tend to create uneven lighting.

It is crucial to note that the backlight issue is visible only in a pitch-dark room. In typical lighting conditions, it is hardly noticeable. However, if you use your TV in a dark room, especially with the lights turned off, you might notice the issue.

What is the solution?

While this discovery represents an unfortunate downside to the Hisense H55N5500, it is not a deal-breaker. There are steps that you can take to mitigate the problem. For instance, you can turn off your TV entirely when not in use or even try to adjust the settings.

Another alternative is to buy a bias light. A bias light is an ambient light that is placed behind the TV. It helps to create a more balanced and comfortable viewing experience, ensuring that there is less strain on your eyes. A bias light can correct the backlight issue by raising the overall lighting level of the room, mitigating the impact of the uneven backlight.

If You Are in the Market for a TV, What Should You Do?

The Hisense H55N5500 is an excellent television with impressive picture quality, smart functionality, and an affordable price tag. However, the backlight issue may cause concern for some users. If you often watch TV in a completely dark room, you might notice the issue.

It is always a good idea to do some research before purchasing a new TV. Remember to read reviews and check for any known issues, such as the backlight issue we've discussed here. This will help to make sure that you end up with a product that meets your needs and expectations.

Conclusion:
 
The discovery of the backlight issue on Hisense H55N5500 is indeed shocking. It is a downside to a product that is otherwise an excellent option for an affordable TV. However, the issue may not be too significant for most people, and there are solutions available.

If you like to watch TV in the dark, we suggest investing in a bias light, which could correct the issue. And remember always to research thoroughly before purchasing a TV to ensure that you end up with a product that meets your needs and expectations.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi all,
So after some googling i think i know its either the power board of the led strip but i cant make out from other posts how to diagnose which one.
Tv is a Hisense H55N5500, if shine a torch can see there is a picture and sound if plugged in to sky.
Where and how do i check if its power board or not? Have a multi meter but not sure what readings im looking for and from where?
Attahced pics.
Thank you

 Hi @beno148 ,
Not much info on Hisense but check the voltage on the connector going from the power board to the LED backlights. (see your last image cable leaving from top of power board as disappearing to panel, I think).
Don’t know what the voltages should be there but usually working LED strips are > 100V at the power board.
If no voltage there doesn’t mean that the power board is faulty. It may be that the mainboard has not told it to turn on the backlights.
If you have >230 -250V (and this is only a guess as to the actual voltage) then it may be a problem in the LED backlight array as you are measuring an open circuit voltage i.e. no current flow through the LEDs.
You would then have to access the backlight array and test further
