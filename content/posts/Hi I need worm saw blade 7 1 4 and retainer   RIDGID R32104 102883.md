## Chosen Solution
 Where can I ordered a worm saw parts?

 Hi
Search online for 681673001 (part # for blade) to get results for suppliers that suit you best. Most say unavailable but here is one I found (location of supplier may not suit you though)
Not sure what you meant by retainer. Did you mean the screw shown as part #13 in the parts manual? If not find the part number for the part you need and search online using the part number only to get suppliers.
