Subtitles aren’t just for the hearing impaired—they help you to understand new languages, as well as decipher difficult-to-follow dialogue. If you’re watching a movie on DVD or Blu-ray, you might have a subtitle track included, but usually only in one or two languages (if at all).
 
Thankfully, there are several websites available online, where you can download subtitle tracks for movies, both popular and obscure. This lets you experience movies in an entirely different language to your own.
 
Also, be sure to check out our YouTube channel where we posted a short video going through some of the best options for subtitles:
 

 
## OpenSubtitles
 
With one of the biggest collections of movie subtitles on the internet (over five million, according to the site itself), OpenSubtitles is probably the first site you want to try if you’re looking to download subtitles.
 
The site is a truly international affair, with over 50 different language options to choose from, allowing you to search the site in languages from Aragonese to Vietnamese. 
 
Each upload comes with a movie name, upload date, comments, and an overall rating for the quality of the subtitles provided. Using the prominent search bar at the top, you can look for subtitles that have been uploaded by other users. An advanced search bar lets you search by age, rating, format, and more.
 
The site doesn’t just include movie subtitles, however. You can also download subtitles for TV series, as well as participate in the community forum, where users offer support and tips for finding the best subtitles.
 
## Addic7ed
 
As you can probably guess from the name, Addic7ed (meaning addicted) aims to be the one-stop shop providing subtitles to movie addicts. Like OpenSubtitles, it’s one of the subtitles sites that offer downloads for both movies and TV shows.
 
You’ll need to sign up for Addic7ed to be able to download subtitles. Once you’re signed in, you can search for movies using a search bar, or scroll through a drop-down menu. New releases are prominently displayed in an RSS feed at the top of the page.
 
Like OpenSubtitles, Addic7ed is available in multiple languages, from Arabic to Swedish.
 
## Podnapisi
 
While Podnapisi might sound like it serves the international market, this English-language site for movie subtitles is one of the cleanest and simplest to use. The site boasts over 2 million subtitles for download, with over 58,000 movies and over 6,000 TV series available.
 
Podnapisi is separated into clear sections, with the main page showing a shortlist of the latest uploaded subtitles, as well as sections showing the recently best-rated, most downloaded, and most commented-on uploads.
 
Like other major subtitles sites, Podnapisi allows you to search using an advanced search tool, with options for keywords, years, language and more. If you’re struggling, an active support forum allows you to ask questions and discuss the latest releases.
 
A community effort to translate the site is currently underway, with other languages from Afrikaans to Xhosa available.
 
## YIFY Subtitles
 
Named after the well-known piracy group and with their releases in mind, YIFY Subtitles is another simple-to-use site to download subtitles. Unlike some of the other major sites, YIFY Subtitles only offers movie subtitles for download.
 
Don’t let the link to the piracy group put you off—YIFY Subtitles are safe and piracy-free, offering downloads in multiple languages. The front page offers a list of popular and recently released movies, along with categories separating movies by each language.
 
If you want to look for a specific movie, the search bar should help, with an autosuggestion tool that lets you find a specific release as you type. A page dedicated to each movie offers information on the movie, including length, release date, and rating, with available subtitles listed below.
 
The site itself is free to use, with no registration required. The site handles available subtitles—you’re unable to upload your own.
 
## DIVX Subtitles
 
While the site looks and sounds like something out of the early 2000s, DIVX Subtitles is still a useful resource for finding subtitles to download, especially for older releases. The site has been run since at least 2002 (and before that by a different owner).
 
Updates for DIVX Subtitles continue to trickle through, especially for major releases and non-English movies. You can search the site by keyword, language, format or rating, but you can also take a look at the latest uploads via the category page.
 
If you can’t find the subtitles for an older or foreign language movie, then DIVX Subtitles may be able to help. Many of the subtitles available on the site are in languages other than in English.
 
This makes DIVX Subtitles a useful resource if you’re struggling to watch English-language movies (or you’d like to improve your skills in other languages).
 
## Subscene
 
Subscene has been around since around 2005, offering subtitles in various languages, including those specially designed for the hearing impaired. The interface is simple, with a prominent search bar at the top, and popular movies and forum posts listed on the front page.
 
It offers regular updates from users, with a sign-up page allowing you to submit your own subtitles. Both movie and TV subtitles are available, as well as subtitles for popular music videos.
 
If you’re struggling with the site, you can post on the community forum. This has hundreds of discussions, with posts in various languages offering discussions and tutorials.
 
Each movie has an individual entry page that lists information on the movie itself, like the year of release, with a list of subtitles organized by user-generated ratings and comments shown underneath.
 
## Finding The Best Movie Subtitles
 
These subtitles sites are useful, but they’re run by volunteers and are, in some cases, pretty ad-heavy. Use your own judgment, but you may need to consider blocking ads on these sites to be able to make the most use out of them.
 
If you’re unable to find the right subtitles for a movie, you could also consider creating video subtitles yourself instead.
