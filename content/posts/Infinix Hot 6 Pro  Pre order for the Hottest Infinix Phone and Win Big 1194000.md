The dual rear camera with additional features such as AI portrait mode, bokeh effect, and auto-scene detection technology ensures that you capture every moment with exceptional clarity.

If you’ve ever had a desire to own an Infinix Smartphone, and found no way through, this is your best opportunity. Infinix Mobile has released yet another device in the Hot series – the Infinix Hot 6 Pro – and this could be the best Infinix phone ever. Why? It is designed with a dual camera setting on the rear, an 18:9 display on the screen, and yet it comes at the best price you will find.
 
Infinix is transitioning its phones into becoming Qualcomm material, which is really interesting, in a bid to treat customers with a real feel of the phone, and probably a faster experience. We’ve already seen Qualcomm rule ont he Infinix S3, and can’t wait to feel it on more Infinix phones.
 
This, added to the fact that the future phones from the manufacturer will accomodate pure Android (no more XOS), means that the Hot 6 Pro is a huge deal to try out.
