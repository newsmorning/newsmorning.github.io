# Alienware 13 brings virtual reality to the next level - Order yours now from Dell!


Virtual reality has been one of the most promising technologies of recent times, but the lack of available hardware has been an issue for many prospective users. However, those days are over with the launch of Alienware 13 – a virtual reality-ready laptop that will blow your mind. 


## Introducing the Alienware 13

The Alienware 13 is a spectacularly designed laptop that is capable of delivering amazing virtual reality experiences at an affordable price. It is equipped with a 7th Generation Intel Core processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 Series graphics, and is fully compatible with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. This 13-inch laptop is a powerhouse that can be used on the go or at home. Its 2.5kg weight means that it is easy to carry around, but with a battery life of up to 10 hours, it can run all day without any issues. 


## Next level VR experience

The Alienware 13 has been designed specifically for virtual reality, so it comes with a whole host of features that will enhance your overall VR experience. The 13-inch OLED display has been specifically designed to deliver the best VR experience possible, with a resolution of 2560x1440 pixels and an impressive colour gamut of 100% Adobe RGB. The OLED technology provides deeper blacks and brighter whites, which translates to even more immersive experiences when in VR.

Another standout feature of the Alienware 13 is the Tobii Eye Tracking technology. This allows gamers to control the game by just looking at objects on the screen. This technology is not only useful for gaming, but also for applications such as drawing, design and even general computer use.


## Prepare for the future

The Alienware 13 is just the beginning of virtual reality integration into everyday life. With the ability to use both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, users can engage with the VR content that is currently available and get accustomed to this exciting technology. As VR evolves, it is clear that devices such as the Alienware 13 will become more common in households, offices and classrooms.

Alienware is recognized as one of the top PC manufacturers, providing top-notch components and features. Both from an aesthetic and performance point of view, Alienware devices are created to impress. The latest addition to the Alienware family is the Alienware 13, brought to the public courtesy of Dell. While Dell’s Alienware 13 comes with a lot of features that will be familiar to those that have used Alienware devices before, it also brings new additions to the table, which only improve on the already feature-rich recipe that has built the Alienware namesake over the course of its existence.
 
Alienware 13 is the smallest Alineware model released by Dell. Its selling point (aside from being an Alienware) is the fact that it has VR support. The manufacturer praises the device as being highly compact on top of performance savvy.
 
Other features of the device include its NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 as well as its capability to configure the LED lights on the device, which are grouped in eight zones. These zones can be programmed individually and users have 20 colors to choose from. The processor that runs the show is the Core i7-6700HQ from Intel, which also features 16 GB of RAM.
