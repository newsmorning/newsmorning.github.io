Title: You Won't Believe What This Canon Camera Did When It Saw Its CF Card! Error Message Leaves Photographer Stunned!

Are you a photographer who relies heavily on digital cameras? If yes, you'd probably agree that keeping your CF (compact flash) card in good condition is paramount. But what happens when your camera suddenly throws an error message after inserting your CF card? The frustration can be overwhelming, and that was the experience of a photographer who owned a Canon camera.

On this fateful day, the photographer was eager to capture some stunning shots at a high-profile event. But things didn't quite go as planned when he inserted his CF card into his Canon camera. To his surprise, he saw an error message that read "ERR 99"! For someone who was looking forward to capturing perfect shots, this was an absolute nightmare.

A quick online search revealed that this error occurred due to a communication breakdown between the camera's body and the lens. The issue could arise from several sources like a faulty CF card, a problematic lens, or even a dirtied camera contact. The concerned photographer tried various tricks, including changing lenses, cleaning the contact points, and even rebooting the camera. But, sadly, the error message kept popping up.

Just when he was about to give up on capturing any shots, something magical happened. The photographer decided to remove and reinsert his CF card, hoping that might do the trick. To his complete amazement, the camera did the unexpected! As soon as he reinserted the CF card, the camera sparked to life and went into overdrive, capturing snap after snap faster than he thought possible.

The photographer couldn't believe his eyes. The error message had disappeared as quickly as it had appeared! The camera worked with remarkable speed and efficiency, capturing amazing shots that left him breathless. If anyone had told him that his CF card could trigger such a miraculous response, he would have had a hard time believing it.

In conclusion, as a photographer, don't dismiss anything as impossible, as sometimes things happen when you least expect them. Always ensure that you keep your equipment in top condition, including your CF card, to avoid errors and related problems. You never know; your CF card might just be the magical ingredient your camera needs to capture that amazing shot. So don't give up hope, as sometimes, all it takes is a little intuition and creativity, and who knows what you might achieve!

## Chosen Solution
 I've been having this CF card error message on my 350D pop up each time i try to use it.
I had a root around, and I believe the problem is a bent card reader pin inside the system itself.
Is this repairable? if so, how much, if it isnt a home fix.
thanks!

 I just repaired this on my 350d. Unfortunately the CF card reader pins are individually soldered to the main board so you can't just replace the bent ones, you have to replace the entire main board. I got a replacement board using a donor camera I got off ebay - the donor camera was spares/repairs due to terrible physical condition and a smashed lcd display glass but did just about work as a camera so the main board was intact. This cost me £30 but after swapping the boards between the donor and my own 350d I should be able to get around £20 back reselling the donor on ebay as bad condition and cf error.
I'll find the websites I used for teardown instructions, it's not a particularly difficult fix just a little fiddly at times. If you attempt it and need any help at any point I'm happy to help as I did it myself so recently it's fresh in my mind.
