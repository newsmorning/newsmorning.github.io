# You won't BELIEVE how many WEAPONS are in Ninjala! Find out which ones to MASTER and which to avoid like the PLAGUE with our Best Vs Worst GUIDE!

If you're a fan of the multiplayer action games, then there's no chance that you haven't heard about Ninjala. This free-to-play game developed by GungHo Online Entertainment is making quite the noise in the gaming world, and it's not all for nothing. With its fast-paced action and a lot of interesting new mechanics, Ninjala is quickly becoming a favorite of many gamers worldwide.

However, it's not just the new mechanics and the fast-paced action that makes Ninjala so interesting; it's also the vast array of weapons and abilities that you can use to enhance your gameplay experience. With so many choices, it can be confusing to decide which weapon you should use to master the game. But worry not, for we have outlined the best and worst weapons in Ninjala.

## The Best Weapons

1. Yo-yos: Yo-yos in Ninjala are the jack of all trades. They are amazing at close range and can even hit enemies from a great distance. Yo-yos can be used to attack enemies directly or hit them from behind to inflict status ailments. They're also great for breaking down blocks and fortifications.

2. Hammer: Hammer in Ninjala is one of the most damaging weapons in the game. With this weapon, you can hit your enemies with a powerful, shockwave attack that deals enormous damage. Not only that, but the hammer can also be used to break shields and blockades with ease.

3. Drill: The drill in Ninjala is the go-to weapon for players who like to play aggressively. With its fast attacking speed and high damage output, the drill is perfect for players who like to get in their opponents' faces and dish out serious damage.

## The Worst Weapons

1. Noodles: Noodles in Ninjala are perhaps the weakest weapon in the game. While they're fast, they're easy to evade, and do very little damage. It's best to avoid the noodles in the game unless you want a severe handicap.

2. Umbrella: The Umbrella in Ninjala is difficult to use effectively. While it has an extended reach and a decent blocking ability, it requires a lot of skill and timing to land hits with.

3. Yo-yos (Surprised): "But wait, yo-yos were in the best weapon list?" Yes, but there's a catch. Yo-yos in Ninjala are fantastic if you know how to use them, but if you don't, they can be the worst weapon in the game. If you're new to the game, it's best to avoid yo-yos until you learn how to use them correctly.

In conclusion, while it's always great to have more options, some weapons are better than others. With the Ninjala's Best Vs Worst Guide, you can now pick the right weapon for your style and skill level. Don't forget that each weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, so take some time to master the ones you like the most. Happy ninjing!
