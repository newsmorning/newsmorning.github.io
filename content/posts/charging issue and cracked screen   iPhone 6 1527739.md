# You Won't Believe the Shocking Truth Behind This iPhone 6's Charging Problem and Cracked Screen!

If you're someone who has ever experienced a problem with an iPhone or any smartphone for that matter, you know it can be frustrating. One common issue that many iPhone 6 users face is a charging problem, which is often accompanied by a cracked screen. While it may seem like a coincidence, there is a shocking truth behind these two problems that you won't believe.

First, let's talk about the charging problem. Many iPhone 6 users have reported that their phones won't charge, or that they have to wiggle the charging cord around to get it to connect properly. This problem can be caused by a faulty charging port, which is a small piece inside the phone that connects the charging cord to the battery.

The shocking truth is that this problem is often caused by the use of non-Apple charging cords. While it may seem like any charging cord should work, non-Apple cords often don't have the same quality standards as Apple's cords, and they can cause damage to the charging port over time. This damage can make it difficult or even impossible for the phone to charge properly.

Now let's talk about the cracked screen. It's no secret that iPhone screens are delicate and can crack easily, even with the use of a protective case. However, what many people don't realize is that a cracked screen can actually affect the phone's ability to charge.

The shocking truth is that a cracked screen can cause damage to the phone's battery, which can lead to a charging problem. When the screen is cracked, it can allow dust, debris, and moisture to get inside the phone and affect its internal components. This can cause the battery to malfunction, which in turn can make it difficult to charge the phone.

So what can you do if you're experiencing these problems with your iPhone 6? The first step is to make sure you're using an Apple-certified charging cord. This can help prevent damage to the charging port and ensure that your phone charges properly.

If your screen is cracked, it's important to get it fixed as soon as possible. Not only can a cracked screen affect your phone's ability to charge, but it can also make it difficult to use your phone properly. You can either take your phone to an Apple store or find a reputable repair service to fix the screen.

In conclusion, the shocking truth behind the iPhone 6's charging problem and cracked screen is that they are often connected. Using non-Apple charging cords can cause damage to the charging port, and a cracked screen can damage the battery and affect the phone's ability to charge. By taking the necessary steps to prevent and fix these problems, you can ensure your iPhone 6 continues to function properly for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I cracked my screen and it seemed to be working fine then later that night i had it charging but it wasn't exactly charging. It should the power thing but my batter percentage want going up, it was just staying or going down as time flew by. Is it my charger port or my battery or do I simply need a new charger.

 Always try an original Apple charger to rule that out but most likely not the case. If your charger was bad your phone wouldn't recognize it at all.
Most likely a faulty battery or your tristar ic on your motherboard. I would try a battery first (known good one) and a restore never hurts in case its a software bug.
Last resort would be (and this is still very likely), your tristar charging ic on the board itself which is a solder job. You could have a professional shop run a voltage test on caps near the tristar to check it as well.
