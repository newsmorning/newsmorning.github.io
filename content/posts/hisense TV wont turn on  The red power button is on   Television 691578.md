# Owners Are Frustrated and Confused When They Find Out Why Their Hisense TV Won't Turn On - Hint: It's Not What You Think!

If you are a proud owner of a Hisense TV, you may have encountered a frustrating problem: your TV won't turn on! Before you go into panic mode and start thinking about costly repairs, it's essential to know that the solution to this common problem may be simple and easy.

The problem in question here is related to the remote control of your Hisense TV. Have you ever tried to turn it on using the physical power button located on the TV set? If you have and it works, but the remote control does not, we may have the solution for you. The power button on your TV set will work as it is supposed to, but the remote control may not turn your TV on.

The problem with your Hisense TV remote control not working to turn on your TV can actually be caused by a simple setting that you may have unknowingly changed. The “Energy Saving” mode set on your TV may be the culprit, and it could be stopping your TV from turning on with the remote control.

The “Energy Saving” mode is designed to reduce the amount of energy consumed by your Hisense TV, hence it limits the TV's functionality to save energy. This mode turns off your TV automatically after a certain amount of inactive time, and it may also stop your TV from turning on with the remote control.

To fix this problem, you can simply disable the “Energy Saving” mode in your Hisense TV settings. Follow the steps below to turn the mode off:

1. Turn on your Hisense TV using the physical power button located on the TV set.
2. Press the “Menu” button on your remote control to access the TV settings.
3. In the settings tab, navigate to “Picture and Sound,” then “Energy Saving.”
4. Choose “Off” to disable the Energy Saving mode.

Once you have turned off the “Energy Saving” mode in your Hisense TV settings, your remote control should work to turn your TV on again. This simple setting could be the answer to your frustration and confusion when your Hisense TV won't turn on.

In conclusion, if you are experiencing problems with your Hisense TV not turning on, it's essential to first check whether it is a remote control issue. The “Energy Saving” mode that limits your TV's functionality to save electricity could be causing the issue. By disabling this mode in your TV settings, you can restore the full functionality of your TV's remote control, saving you the cost of an unnecessary repair.

## Chosen Solution
 My 75 inch hisense TV wont turn on. The red power button is on . But the remote will not turn it on….what is the problem.  The breaker box went off  I turned the box back on but my TV will not turn

 Hi,
What is the model number of the TV?
Was the TV on at the time that the breaker operated?
Try a power reset and see if that works.
Disconnect the power from the TV and then press and hold the TV’s Power On button for a full 30 seconds and then release it.
Reconnect the power to the TV and try to turn the TV on.
If still no good then then TV will have to be opened and the boards inspected and tested for any damage caused by the power interruption
