You won't believe the shocking reason why your iPhone 6's home button won't wake up your device!

If you are an iPhone 6 user and have been grappling with a non-responsive home button, then keep reading. This issue has been plaguing iPhone 6 owners for years now, and even some technical experts are not sure what causes it. However, we have dug deep and found a shocking reason behind the problem.

First, let's understand why you need the home button in the first place. The home button is the physical button located at the bottom of your iPhone's display screen. It allows you to return to your home screen or activate Siri. Without it, your user experience can become extremely frustrating as navigating your iPhone becomes more cumbersome.

Now, coming back to the problem, the reason why your iPhone 6's home button isn't responding may be due to a damaged IC chip. An IC chip or Integrated Circuit chip is a tiny component that performs a specific function on a device's motherboard. In the case of the iPhone 6 home button, the IC chip controls its haptic feedback.

Haptic feedback is a feature that provides a tactile response or a vibration when you interact with your device's touch screen. For instance, when you click on an app or the home button, your iPhone vibrates slightly to provide you with haptic feedback. This feature is essential as it gives users a sense of touch and helps them navigate through their device efficiently.

However, the IC chip responsible for the haptic feedback can get damaged from repeated use. As a result, the home button stops responding or becomes sporadically responsive. In some cases, the home button may only work when you apply excessive pressure, thus increasing the risk of creating more damage.

So, what's the solution? Well, unfortunately, the only option is to replace the IC chip or the home button entirely. This process can be costly and time-consuming, and sometimes it may require a complete device replacement.

In conclusion, if you're facing issues with your iPhone 6's home button, now you know the possible reason behind it. Experts believe that the damaged IC chip is a prevalent issue among iPhone 6 users. Nevertheless, repairing or replacing the home button is the only way to solve this problem. If you're unsure about the issue, it's always best to seek professional help from a certified repair center or an Apple store.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi Guys,
I have a problem with an iPhone 6. The screen has been replaced. The Home button is the original.
Now I can no longer wake up with the Home button the device. With the Power button I can wake the device. And as soon as the device is turned on, also works the Home button without problems - except TouchID.
Can someone help me ? Is really broken the Home button? Or the heat shield behind the display?

 Try to calibrate the home button:
Push and hold the power button till you see the swipe icon for turn off the device,
the push and hold the power button till the iphone come back to the home screen,
now try to use the home button again!
If still not work, for well understand what could be, backup everything using itunes and restore the software.
Than, use it without restore your backup, as a new ipad and verify the correct or not behave of the home button..

 Doesn't work. Any1 other ? Please help me. Can it be the BackShield on the Display ? Or the Homebutton it self ?  But why is working, when device was waked up with power button.

 Theres are a few things that could affect the home button to cause it not to work.
- The home button is defective
-Home button ribbon cable got damage during the repair (Check ribbon for signs of tear or rips)
-Back shield was damage during the repair (Check shield for signs of tear or rips on the connections and ribbon)

 So I have the same problem except it doesn’t always happen but power button doesn’t work to wake it up either
i replaced the screen, home button works fine except Touch ID, and I also have a 6 plus
