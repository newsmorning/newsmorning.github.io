Title: You won't believe what happened when this owner changed their steering column on their 1988-1998 GMC pickup - it's not starting!

Introduction:
Changing the steering column of a vehicle can be a daunting task, especially for older models. However, when it comes to a 1988-1998 GMC pickup, it can be quite the challenge. But what happens when the vehicle doesn't start after the steering column is changed? Let's explore the possible reasons why this might have happened.

Possible Issues:
1. Wiring System: After changing the steering column, the wiring system of the vehicle might have been tampered with or disconnected. Any mistakes made during the installation can lead to connectivity issues, which might ultimately prevent the pickup from starting. It is essential to ensure that wires are correctly attached and not damaged while installing the steering column.
2. Ignition Cylinder: One common factor that can lead to a vehicle not starting is the ignition cylinder. A damaged or poorly installed ignition cylinder can cause issues, preventing the truck from starting. If the key is not turning in the ignition cylinder or there is no clicking sound, it might indicate damage to the cylinder.
3. Security System: Some 1988-1998 GMC pickups come with a factory-installed security system that can prevent the vehicle from starting if triggered. If the security system is not correctly disabled or reactivated after installing the new steering column, the truck might not start.

What To Do:
If your 1988-1998 GMC pickup won't start after changing the steering column, there are a few things you can do. Firstly, check the wiring system to ensure everything is correctly connected and functioning. Secondly, inspect the ignition cylinder to eliminate the possibility of damage or improper installation. Thirdly, check the truck's security system to make sure it has not been inadvertently triggered.

In conclusion, the installation of a new steering column in a 1988-1998 GMC pickup can lead to various issues preventing the vehicle from starting. However, with proper installation and checks on the wiring system, ignition cylinder, and security system, it is possible to get the pickup up and running again. If you're experiencing issues after changing your steering column, don't hesitate to seek the help of a qualified mechanic.

## Chosen Solution
 What are the electrical plugs at the base of the steering column?

 Those plugs are for all the indicators (turn signals, high beams etc) as well as the ignition system. All must be plugged in to their counterparts in the dash for those systems to work.
