Title: Warning: Defender Smartscreen is Sabotaging Your Windows 11 Experience with Unexpected Video Playback Glitches!

Introduction:

As more and more people switch to Windows 11, a new issue has arisen. Defender Smartscreen, which is designed to protect users from malicious websites, is causing unexpected video playback glitches. This can be frustrating for users who are just trying to enjoy some entertainment on their computer. In this article, we will explore this issue and suggest some solutions to help you fix it.

What is Defender Smartscreen?

Defender Smartscreen is a security feature that is included in the Windows 11 operating system. It is designed to protect users from malicious websites and downloads. When you browse the internet or download a file, Defender Smartscreen checks it against a list of known threats. If it finds something suspicious, it will block the website or download and warn you.

The Problem with Defender Smartscreen and Video Playback

While Defender Smartscreen is an important security feature, it can also cause problems for users who want to watch videos on their computer. When you try to play a video, Defender Smartscreen may block it, causing the video to stutter or freeze. This can be frustrating, especially if you are trying to watch a movie or TV show.

Possible Solutions

There are several solutions that you can try to fix the video playback issue caused by Defender Smartscreen. Here are some of the most effective ones:

1. Disable Defender Smartscreen: The easiest way to fix the issue is to disable Defender Smartscreen. While this may leave you vulnerable to malicious websites, you can always re-enable it after you finish watching your video.

2. Use an Alternative Browser: If you are using Microsoft Edge, try using a different browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. This may help you bypass the issue caused by Defender Smartscreen.

3. Adjust Your Firewall Settings: You can also try adjusting your firewall settings to allow video playback. To do this, go to Control Panel > Windows Firewall > Allow an App or Feature through Firewall. Find your video player and make sure it is allowed through the firewall.

Conclusion:

Defender Smartscreen is an important security feature in Windows 11, but it can cause unexpected video playback glitches. If you are experiencing this issue, try disabling Defender Smartscreen, using an alternative browser, or adjusting your firewall settings. With a little effort, you can enjoy your favorite videos without any interruption. Remember to always stay vigilant when it comes to online security and protect yourself from malicious websites and downloads.


What can be said about Microsoft’s antivirus solution? Well, even though it’s not as popular as other similar software out there, it is still ranked pretty high, efficiency-wise.
 
- Windows Defender is an antivirus used by a large number of people, even though not the most popular.Recent security rankings tests have included Defender and the software scored pretty big on the charts.However, Microsoft's antivirus software isn't free of bugs or errors and users are reporting new issues.This time around, Defender seems to be the root cause of some pretty nasty video playback problems.

 
There still are a lot of people that rely on Defender for protection and it seems to be pretty stable. At least, it seemed to, until Microsoft released the latest Windows 11 Beta build.
 
Things going haywire isn’t something new on the tech giant’s plate, but having issues with the one software that is supposed to keep you safe isn’t something to take lightly.
 
## 
 
Many users that have been actively testing build 22581 are reporting severe video playback delays that are caused by the antivirus. 
 
MKV files seem to be the victims, but other video container formats may also be affected, as ISOs are apparently also facing this delayed execution problem. 
 
This caught many off-guard, as this issue isn’t listed among the known problems for the build which means it probably went undetected during testing.
 
However, not all is lost, as with every problem, there is bound to be a solution, even if we are talking about a temporary one, for the time being.
 
A simple workaround for this issue is disabling the Check apps and files option under SmartScreen settings. 
 
Users trying this were able to resolve the issue. But before proceeding to apply this workaround, make sure the file type is actually trustworthy.
