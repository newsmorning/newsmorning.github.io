Are Your Windows Games Lagging? Learn the Super Easy Fix for GPU Memory Leaks!

Are you experiencing lagging in your favorite Windows games? Do you feel frustrated by the lack of smooth graphics and gameplay? Many users experience lagging while playing games on their Windows systems because of GPU memory leaks. In this article, we will discuss what GPU memory leaks are and how to fix them quickly.

What are GPU Memory Leaks?

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) memory leaks occur when a video game requests memory from the GPU and then does not release it after it has been used. This can lead to poor system performance and lagging in your games, which can ruin your gaming experience. GPU memory leaks are not the fault of the game developers but can be fixed by the users themselves.

Why Do GPU Memory Leaks Occur?

GPU memory leaks occur due to programming errors, such as incorrectly allocated resources, missing deallocation instructions, or dangling pointers. As a result, the GPU is unable to free up memory when it's no longer needed, causing the graphics card to use more memory than it should.

How to Fix GPU Memory Leaks?

The easiest way to fix GPU memory leaks is to update the graphics card driver. Updating the graphics card driver can fix memory leaks in most cases since the driver manages the graphics memory, and any issues with it can cause memory leaks. It is also essential to update your operating system, as updates include bug fixes, including those that can cause memory leaks.

If updating your drivers and operating system does not fix the issue, you should check for any other applications that could be using up GPU memory. Close any unnecessary applications, such as a web browser or media player, to free up memory and enhance the gaming experience.

In more severe cases, you may need to upgrade your hardware, such as the graphics card or RAM. This will significantly enhance your system's performance and take care of any memory leaks that might occur.

Final Thoughts

GPU Memory leaks can be frustrating, but they're not an irresolvable problem. By following the simple steps above, you can quickly fix the issue and improve your gaming experience. Keep your system updated, close unnecessary applications, and if required, upgrade your hardware. By doing so, you will be able to enjoy smooth and uninterrupted gameplay.

Memory leak issues are not entirely uncommon on Windows PCs. When there’s a memory leak, software packages utilize excessive memory. Different types of memory leaks can arise for standard system RAM and graphics cards’ VRAM. Such leaks can have a notable impact on PC performance.
 
## GPU memory leaks are connected to the graphics card VRAM memory
 
- GPU memory leaks occur when software holds back too much VRAM, which leads to excessive memory utilization.
 - You might need to fix these errors, such as the Out of video memory issue, by adjusting the paging filing settings.
 - Lowering certain graphical settings for games can ease GPU memory spike issues.

## What’s VRAM?
 
VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) is a specific type of graphical RAM for temporarily storing graphics data. Dedicated graphics cards have their own VRAM for handling advanced graphics. Some NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards (GPUs) boast up to 16 GB VRAM.
 
### What are GPU memory leaks?
 
A GPU memory leak is one that more specifically pertains to graphics cards’ VRAM. Such leaks typically arise because games and other graphics-intensive software don’t correctly release memory. Consequently, VRAM utilization can reach up to, and even eclipse, 100 percent for affected programs.
 
Such GPU memory leaks most commonly arise for Windows games, which are the most graphics-intensive software. When games utilize almost all available VRAM, notable frame rate drops can occur. Such frame rate drops result in stuttering and slow gameplay.
 
In the worst cases, GPU memory leaks can crash games. For example, the Out of video memory error is a widely reported one for games. When that issue arises, games crash when starting; and the error message shown directly below pops up.
 
Such issues will more commonly arise on PCs equipped with lower-specification graphics cards. The less VRAM a graphics card has, the more likely games will outstrip available VRAM when GPU leaks occur. Therefore, lowering graphical settings can often reduce the impact of GPU memory leaks.
 
If you ever need to fix a GPU memory leak for a game, various potential solutions might help reduce the excessive VRAM utilization. These are some of the more proven resolutions for fixing VRAM memory issues.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

## How can I fix GPU memory leaks in Windows?
 
### 1. Reduce in-game graphical settings
 
- Launch the game the GPU memory leak occurs for, and open the graphics or video settings tab for the game.
 - Select a lower general graphical preset setting than the current one.
 - If you can’t find any general graphics preset setting, manually lower the resolution, texture, FPS, and shadow graphical options instead.
 - Thereafter, make sure you save the settings.

 
This resolution is primarily for fixing GPU memory leaks that don’t crash games. When a game doesn’t start up because of a VRAM issue, try adjusting graphical settings outside it as outlined in the next resolution.
 
### 2. Reduce your graphics card’s graphical settings
 
#### NVIDIA
 
- Open the NVIDIA Control Panel app.
 - Next, click the Adjust image settings with preview.
 - Select the Use my preference emphasizing quality radio button.
 - Now drag the bar’s slider to the left performance end.
 - Click Apply to save the new graphical settings.

 
#### AMD
 
- Right-click the desktop and select AMD Radeon Settings.
 - Select the Gaming tab, then click Global Settings.
 - Next, select Performance for the Texture Filtering Quality option.
 - Lower the Frame Rate Target Control setting.
 - Turn off the Vertical Refresh and Anisotropic Filtering Mode settings if any are enabled.
 - Select the Apply option to confirm the new settings.

 
### 3. Run Steam games on DirectX 12
 
- Open the Steam app.
 - Select Library at the top of Steam’s window.
 - Right-click a game in your library you need to fix a GPU memory leak for and select Properties.
 - Press the Set Launch Options button.
 - Type the following in the text box: -force-d3d12
 - Then click the OK button.
 - Thereafter, restart Steam to start the game, which will now run with a DirectX 12 configuration.

 
You can also adjust in-game DirectX settings for many games. If you don’t need to fix GPU memory leaks for Steam games, try selecting DirectX 12 via in-game graphical options.
