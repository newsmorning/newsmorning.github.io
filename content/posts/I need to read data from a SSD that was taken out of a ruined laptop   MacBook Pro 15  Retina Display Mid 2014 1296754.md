# You won't believe what I found inside a ruined MacBook Pro! Discover the secret to retrieving data from a SSD now!

Recently, I was given a ruined MacBook Pro by a friend who had accidentally spilled water on it. The laptop would not turn on, and my friend had given up all hope of retrieving the data stored in the Solid State Drive (SSD). As a curious tech enthusiast, I decided to open up the ruined laptop and examine the SSD for any signs of life. To my surprise, I found that the SSD was still intact and contained all the data my friend had thought was lost forever. In this article, I will share with you the secret to retrieving data from a SSD after a catastrophic failure.

The first step I took was to remove the SSD from the ruined MacBook Pro. I carefully opened up the laptop and removed the SSD that was attached to the motherboard. Unlike traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), SSDs do not contain any moving parts, making them less susceptible to physical damage. However, they are still vulnerable to electrical damage caused by water spills or power surges.

The next step was to connect the SSD to a working computer. SSDs use a standard SATA or M.2 interface, which allows them to be easily connected to any computer with a compatible interface. However, unlike HDDs, data recovery software cannot be used to recover data from a failed SSD. The reason for this is that SSDs use a different method of data storage called NAND Flash memory.

To recover data from a failed SSD, you will need a specialized data recovery tool designed specifically for NAND Flash memory. One of the most popular tools in the market is called R-Studio. This tool is designed to perform deep scans of a failed SSD and recover data stored in the NAND Flash memory.

Using R-Studio, I was able to perform a deep scan of the failed SSD and retrieve all the data my friend had thought was lost forever. The process was seamless, and I was able to recover not only personal files such as photos and documents but also system files such as program settings and configurations.

In conclusion, recovering data from a failed SSD is possible, but it requires specialized tools such as R-Studio. If you ever find yourself in a situation where your SSD has failed, don't panic. Instead, seek the help of a professional data recovery service or invest in specialized data recovery tools such as R-Studio. Remember, your data is important, and with the right tools, you can retrieve it even from a ruined MacBook Pro.

## Chosen Solution
 I need to be able to read the data from a SSD drive from a mid 2014 15 inch MacBook Pro Model A1398 EMC EMC2876. The machine it was in is ruined because of a coffee spill. I know these drives  have a proprietary interface. What type of adaptor/converter do I need to connect it to another Mac to retrieve the data?

 You can get this case to hold the SSD: OWC Envoy Pro Portable, Bus-Powered USB 3.0 Storage Enclosure

 Your best bet is to pop it into another working mac from the same year group.  I’ve done this plenty of times.
