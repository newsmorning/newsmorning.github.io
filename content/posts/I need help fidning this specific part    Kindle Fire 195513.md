 Hi :)
I recently  did a digitizer Replacement for my amazon fire 7 2017 tablet (SR043KL) but i some how chiped off the connecter as shown on the image bellow.
Does anyone know where i can find this  conecter part for me to replace ?
Thanks
chris

 Thats the touch connector where the touch flex attach.That`s hard to find but you can insert touch connector and place some paper ond tape over so the flex can attach on connector properly.
