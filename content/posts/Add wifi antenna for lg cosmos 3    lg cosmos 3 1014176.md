Transform Your Lg Cosmos 3 Into a Wifi Hotspot on Steroids with This Simple Antenna Hack!

Do you own an LG Cosmos 3 and are looking to enhance its wifi capabilities? Look no further than this simple antenna hack that can transform your device into a wifi hotspot on steroids.

First off, it's important to understand how antennas work. Antennas are designed to receive and transmit radio signals. They come in different shapes and sizes depending on the frequency they need to receive or transmit. In the case of the LG Cosmos 3, its wifi antenna is small and located within the device.

What this means is that its wifi range is limited, and you may experience weak signals in areas with poor network coverage. Luckily, you can improve its wifi range with a few simple steps.

Step 1: Materials

To begin with, you'll need a few materials to get started, including:

- Copper wire
- Pliers
- Drill
- Sandpaper
- Electrical tape

You can easily find these materials in your local hardware store, and they won't cost you much. Once you have them, you can start with the hack.

Step 2: Creating an Antenna

The next step is to create an antenna that can receive and transmit radio signals effectively. You can do this by taking a piece of copper wire and cutting it to the appropriate length. The ideal length for a wifi antenna is roughly 14 inches.

Once you have the piece of copper wire, bend it in half to create a "V" shape. Then, use your pliers to bend the ends at a 90-degree angle to form two hooks. These hooks will be used to attach the antenna to your LG Cosmos 3.

Step 3: Attaching the Antenna

Now that you have your antenna, it's time to attach it to your LG Cosmos 3. The device's wifi antenna is located at the top of its back cover. You'll need to remove the cover to access the antenna.

Using your drill, make a small hole at the top of the back cover, right next to where the wifi antenna is located. Carefully push one of the hooks of the copper wire through the hole and attach it to the wifi antenna. Use electrical tape to secure the wire in place.

Finally, attach the other hook of the copper wire to a solid metal object that can act as a ground. You can use a metal rod or pipe for this purpose.

With the antenna attached, you should see a noticeable improvement in your LG Cosmos 3's wifi range. You can now use it as a wifi hotspot on steroids and connect multiple devices to it without any lag or weak signals.

In conclusion, with a few simple materials and steps, you can transform your LG Cosmos 3 into a wifi hotspot on steroids. With an extended wifi range, you can now stay connected and productive even in areas with poor network coverage. Give this hack a try and see the difference it makes!


## Chosen Solution
 LG Cosmos 3, no wifi but there is a spot on motherboard for wifi antenna. Can you add wifi antenna and get wifi on phone? Just want to know if it could work, Thanks for any replies.

 Frankly, there is no good solution to this questioned problem of yours. I enjoy being politically correct. If you take the motherboard out of your phone and solder a ground wire to your g string, then wifi will be obtainable. If you answer the questions and have unlimited data, then your internet will be slower than ass.

 I think the answer is NO.
