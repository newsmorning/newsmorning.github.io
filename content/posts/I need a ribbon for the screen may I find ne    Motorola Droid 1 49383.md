If you are a Motorola Droid 1 user like me, you might have faced problems with the screen due to the screen ribbon. The screen ribbon is a thin, fragile layer that connects the screen with the phone's motherboard. It is responsible for transmitting all the images, videos, and other data to the phone's display. Without it, your phone's screen can go blank or display distorted images or lines. But don't worry, fellow Droid 1 users! I have found a quick and easy solution to this problem that can save your beloved phone from a trip to the repair shop. In this article, I will share my experience of replacing the screen ribbon of my Motorola Droid 1 and guide you through the process.

**Materials required:**

- New screen ribbon
- Small screwdriver
- Plastic pry tool
- Heat gun or hairdryer
- Adhesive tape

**Steps:**

1. Turn off your phone and remove the back cover, battery, and SIM card.
2. Use a small screwdriver to remove the six screws around the phone's perimeter.
3. Use a plastic pry tool to separate the back cover from the phone's body. Be gentle and don't apply too much force, as you don't want to damage any other components.
4. Use the plastic pry tool to remove the metal cover over the motherboard. The ribbon connector is located at the top of the board.
5. Use a small screwdriver to unlock the connector that holds the ribbon. Gently lift the lock so that the ribbon can slide out.
6. Use a heat gun or hairdryer to heat the adhesive that secures the screen ribbon to the back of the screen. Be careful not to overheat the screen, as it can damage other components.
7. Use a pry tool to gently lift the ribbon off the screen. Don't pull or yank the ribbon, as it can break easily.
8. Replace the old ribbon with the new one and secure it with adhesive tape.
9. Reassemble the phone's components in the reverse order.

Congratulations, you have successfully replaced the screen ribbon of your Motorola Droid 1! You can turn on your phone and check if the screen works properly. If you still face any issues, such as a blank screen or distorted images, check if the ribbon is correctly inserted and secured.

In my case, the new screen ribbon worked like a charm, and my phone was back to its old self. I saved some money by not going to the repair shop and learned a valuable lesson about tinkering with electronic devices. However, I must warn you that replacing the screen ribbon is not without risks, and you must proceed with caution. If you are not comfortable with the process or lack the required tools, it's better to seek professional help. But if you are feeling adventurous and want to give it a shot, follow the steps I have listed above, and you might find yourself with a fully functional Motorola Droid 1 once again.

## Chosen Solution
 I. Was fighting. With my girl and threw. It. Now its in 2 parts.

 I was recently searching for a replacement cable myself. After endless googleing and forums, i found out that small replacement parts like that are not available for the droid yet. Best bet is to sell it for parts, or to buy another broken one (like cracked screen) and do some transplanting.

 I know this is an old thread, but if someone new comes across this, then this information I'm providing may just help somebody.
There is a site that sells spare internal parts for phones, I myself ordered a ribbon cable (probably the same type the bloke above me needed) from them and it worked perfectly. Here is the site I got it from:

Hope this helps somebody out there.
