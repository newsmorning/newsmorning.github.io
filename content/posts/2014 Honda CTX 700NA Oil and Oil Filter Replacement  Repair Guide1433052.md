Changing the oil and oil filter in your 2014 Honda Ctx 700Na is a task that many people avoid, but it is surprisingly easy to do. Rather than paying a mechanic to change your vehicle's oil, you can save money by following this simple repair guide.

The first step is to purchase the necessary tools and supplies. You will need an oil filter wrench, an oil drain pan, a funnel, a container to transport the used oil for recycling, a new oil filter, and the oil recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.

Next, you need to warm up your Honda's engine by letting it run for a few minutes. Warm oil flows more easily than cold oil, making it easier to drain the oil. Afterward, turn off the engine and locate the oil filter and oil drain plug underneath the vehicle.

Place the oil drain pan under the oil drain plug and use a ratchet or wrench to remove the plug. Allow the oil to drain completely into the pan. You may need to use pliers or a specialized oil filter wrench to remove the old oil filter.

Clean the area around the oil filter and screw in the new filter. Do not overtighten, the manufacturer will likely provide specific instructions on the right amount of turning.

Reinstall the oil drain plug and pour the recommended amount of new oil into the engine using the funnel. Check the level of the oil with the dipstick and add more oil if needed.

Finally, start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to circulate the new oil. Check for any leaks around the oil filter and drain plug, and dispose of the used oil properly. You can take it to a local auto parts store for proper disposal.

In conclusion, changing the oil and oil filter in your 2014 Honda Ctx 700Na is a straightforward task that anyone can do with the right tools and instructions. Follow this repair guide now and save yourself money and time in the future while also keeping your vehicle running smoothly.
