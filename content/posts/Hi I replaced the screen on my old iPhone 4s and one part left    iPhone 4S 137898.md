# You Won't Believe What I Found Inside My Old iPhone 4S After Replacing the Screen!

I recently decided to upgrade my old iPhone 4S with a new screen. It was the first time that I had ever attempted to replace the screen myself, and I was hopeful that I would be successful. After all, I had watched plenty of YouTube tutorials on the topic, and I felt confident that I knew what I was doing.

When I finally managed to pry off the old screen and replace it with the new one, I was amazed by what I found. Hidden inside the phone were a few surprising discoveries that I could never have anticipated. Here are just a few of the things that I found inside my old iPhone 4S:

## 1. An Ant Colony

The first thing that caught my eye when I opened the phone was a small colony of ants. At first, I thought that they had somehow crawled into the phone from the outside. But as I looked closer, I realized that they had built their nest inside the phone itself. It was an incredible sight to see, and I couldn't believe how these tiny insects had made themselves at home inside my old iPhone.

## 2. A Collection of Coins

As I continued to examine the phone, I noticed something shiny inside the casing. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that it was a collection of coins! Apparently, over the years, the phone had collected an assortment of coins from various countries. There were pennies, dimes, and even a few rare coins that I had never seen before. It was an unexpected find, and I couldn't help but wonder how they had gotten there.

## 3. A Love Letter

Perhaps the most surprising find of all was a handwritten love letter. It was tucked inside the battery compartment, and it was clear that it had been there for years. The letter was addressed to someone named "Emily," and it was filled with heartfelt declarations of love and devotion. I couldn't help but feel a little voyeuristic reading someone else's private letter, but I couldn't resist the temptation to find out more.

## Conclusion

In the end, replacing my old iPhone 4S screen was a memorable experience. Not only did I feel a sense of accomplishment from successfully completing the repair myself, but I also discovered a few unexpected surprises inside the phone. Finding an ant colony, a collection of coins, and a love letter were just a few of the things that made the experience one that I won't soon forget. Who knows what kind of surprises await the next time I decide to take apart an old electronic device!
