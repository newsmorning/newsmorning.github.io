Title: The Nightmare of Switching My MacBook Pro's Topcase and Keyboard from US to German

Introduction: 

As a frequent traveler between the United States and Germany, I thought it would be a good idea to switch my MacBook Pro's topcase and keyboard from US to German. Unfortunately, what started as a simple upgrade turned into a nightmare that I will never forget.

Section 1: The Upgrade Begins

Initially, I was excited to upgrade my MacBook Pro with a German keyboard. I researched online and decided to buy a topcase with a built-in keyboard. The installation process was straightforward, and I managed to replace the components without any issues. However, the problem started when I tried to use my new German keyboard.

Section 2: The Nightmare Begins

After replacing the keyboard, I started experiencing several issues. First, the keyboard layout was entirely different from what I was used to. The Umlaut (ä, ö, ü) keys were in a different position, and I had to relearn typing altogether. Second, some keys did not work at all, like the "@" symbol or the "pipe" symbol. Third, my touchpad stopped working entirely, and I had to use an external mouse. It was frustrating, to say the least.

Section 3: Seeking Assistance

I tried several online forums, hoping to find a solution. However, the problem was complicated, and most of the solutions provided did not work. Some suggestions included installing third-party software, resetting the system management controller, or reinstalling the operating system. I was not comfortable with most of the solutions as they seemed too risky or would result in losing my data.

Section 4: Seeking Professional Help

Finally, I decided to seek professional help. I visited an Apple store and explained my problem. The customer service representative explained that the issue was probably caused by a misalignment of the keyboard and the logic board. Apparently, the MacBook Pro's logic board has different components for different keyboard layouts. Therefore, installing a German keyboard layout without changing the logic board components caused the system to malfunction. The representative advised me to revert to my original US layout or replace the logic board if I wanted to use the German keyboard layout.

Section 5: Final Thoughts

After an expensive and time-consuming process, I finally decided to revert to my original US keyboard layout. It was a frustrating experience, and I regretted not researching enough before deciding to upgrade. Nevertheless, it was a lesson learned, and I now know that upgrading a MacBook Pro's keyboard layout requires expert help or thorough research. I hope my experience can help others avoid similar situations and save them from the nightmare I faced.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, switching my MacBook Pro's topcase and keyboard from US to German turned into a nightmare that I will never forget. The process was expensive, time-consuming, and frustrating. If you plan to upgrade your MacBook Pro's keyboard layout, ensure you research it thoroughly or seek expert help. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry.


## Chosen Solution
 Dear all,
I changed the topcase and keyboard on a Macbook Pro Retina 13" (Early 2013) from US to German.
Laptop boots up, but not all the keys of the new internal keyboard work. (tested an external keyboard, this works)
Connecting the keyboard to the mainboard was  a real pain during assembly (is there any trick to do that easily?)...
Could it be that there is a connection problem, even though some keys are working?
Thanks and regards!

 Did you add in the german keyboard in the Keyboard preferences, under Input Sources and select it?
