Shocking revelation: LG OLED TV owners stunned by mysterious vertical line on their screens - is your LG Television affected?

LG has always been a top player in the electronics industry with its impressive range of televisions, smartphones, refrigerators, and home appliances. Recently, however, LG OLED TV owners have been left stunned by a mysterious vertical line that has appeared on their screens, causing much concern and frustration.

So, what exactly is this vertical line on LG OLED TVs, and why has it been causing a stir?

Firstly, it's important to understand that this vertical line is not a common defect that affects all LG OLED TVs. Instead, it's a rare occurrence that has only been reported by a select few users. Nonetheless, if you are one of the unlucky few who have been affected, it can be quite concerning.

The vertical line on an LG OLED TV appears as a thin line that runs vertically from the top of the screen to the bottom. It can take on various colors depending on the screen's content, which can be distracting, causing an unpleasant viewing experience. Users report that the line is most noticeable on light-colored backgrounds, which makes sense given the contrast with the line's color.

The cause of this vertical line remains unknown, with some speculating that it's related to the panel's manufacturing process. LG has not released an official statement regarding the matter, only noting on their website that, "If you experience the vertical line issue, please contact our customer service center."

So, what should you do if you own an LG OLED TV?

If you have an LG OLED TV and are experiencing the vertical line, you should contact LG's customer service center immediately. They will be able to guide you through the next steps and offer a solution to the problem, be it a repair or a replacement. It's important to note that LG offers a 1-year manufacturer's warranty, which should cover most issues. However, if your TV is out of warranty, you may need to cover the cost of repairs or a replacement yourself.

In conclusion, while the vertical line on LG OLED TVs is a rare occurrence, it's essential to be aware of the issue if you own one of these televisions. If you are experiencing this problem, don't hesitate to contact LG's customer service center for assistance. Remember, LG is a reputable brand that stands by its products and will do everything possible to resolve this issue.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi. My OLED LG TV just recently started flashing a green vertical line on the screen. I suspected water damage because I cleaned the TV screen 2 days ago with windex. I opened the back and reseated the ribbon cables from the tcon board and placed a heater on it. Now the green line is gone and there are black spots left in it's wake. They function normal on certain colors but are black on mainly light blue and green.
Do you have any suggestions? The OLED panel is glued into place, so if anyone knows how to remove the OLED screen panel would also be good

 Given the change in behavior after the re-seat, I would still suspect the ribbon cable or connectors.  Try cleaning hte connectors with alcohol.  just flood the connector a bit and let it dry.  Wipe off the ends of the cables as well with alcohol.  Re-attach the cables and try again.  This MAY resolve the problem.  It sounds like a connection issue at the moment and not a problem with either the T-con or panel.  If the cleaning does not resolve the problem, I would start by replacing the cables.   This is the cheapest option with which to start.

 Yes, early TVs had this fault. It seems that the problem is actually inside the panel but in the process of working on a laser based repair/reflow technique from the back or side. 1.8W blue light seems to be the key from what I can find, the microscopic solder joints made from (IIRC) an indium tin eutectic have a tendency to come apart even with moderate heat. Same fault as on some early graphics chips.
