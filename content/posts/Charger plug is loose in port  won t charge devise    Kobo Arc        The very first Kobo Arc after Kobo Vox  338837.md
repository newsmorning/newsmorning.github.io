Is Your Kobo Arc From The First Generation? Beware! Loose Charger Plug Could Be The Reason Your Device Won't Charge!

As technology progresses, it is natural for electronic devices to become outdated and even discontinued. However, if you are still using the original Kobo Arc tablet, you may be facing a common issue with its charging port.

First-generation Kobo Arc tablets, released in 2012, are known to have charging port issues. As a result, they may not charge even when connected to a power source.

One of the reasons for this issue is a loose charger plug. Over time and with excessive use, the charging port may wear out, and the plug may become loose. The reason why this is a problem is simple: if the plug does not fit tightly into the port, the device may not receive enough power to charge.

So, what can be done if you are facing this issue with your Kobo Arc tablet?

One option is to inspect the charger port carefully for any signs of damage or wear. If you notice any, it is advisable to take your device to a professional for repair. Attempting to fix it on your own may cause further damage and ultimately cost you more money.

Another option is to use a wireless charging pad. Some newer Kobo models support wireless charging, and a wireless charging pad can be an excellent alternative if you cannot use a charger plug.

In conclusion, loose charger plugs are a known issue with the first-generation Kobo Arc tablets. If you are facing the same issue, it is crucial to get your device inspected and repaired by a professional. Alternatively, consider using a wireless charging pad as a cost-effective solution. Whatever option you decide on, remember to prioritize your device's safety and well-being.

## Chosen Solution
 I don’t have proper connection because charging plug is loose in charging port. On the beginning was possible to “find proper spot” by gently moving plug, but now it is impossible to charge the devise.

 Kobo uses micro-USB port PCB connector held on to PCB only by solder pads (no mechanical support, some mechanical restraint) so designed to eventually fail if excessive force, lateral or inwards, used to insert USB plug.
Connections are large solder pads for charging and main support, and a bunch of tiny pins for data, so needs to be reflowed to reconnect.
Using a USB charging plug with body support leaving only a short metal end protruding, like those provided with tablets, will reduce the chance of separating the connector from the PCB.
Check Mobilereads Kobo forum for more info, help, and support.

 Most lokely you need to either replace the board that the charger plugs into or you need to solder in a new charging port if you can't find that board.

 ive had the same issue too with my childhood tablet . i dropped it outside my garden taking photos of the plants and that same night we were charging it, it worked! but eventually the charger no longer fits and it appears to be wobbling and not too good looking, as i am a kid in a poor environment, this makes it difficult for me to repair it/ getting it repaired as im not sure if itll be pricey to repair.
