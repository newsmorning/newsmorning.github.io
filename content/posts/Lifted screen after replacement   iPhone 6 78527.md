Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Lifted the Screen After Replacing My iPhone 6!

As a heavy iPhone user, the day eventually comes when the screen becomes damaged or cracked to the point where it needs to be replaced. And like many people, I opted for a relatively affordable third-party replacement instead of going through Apple.

After replacing the screen on my iPhone 6, I carefully reassembled it and powered it on. Everything seemed to be working fine – the touch screen was responsive, the home button was working, the camera was functioning – but when I looked closer, I noticed something strange. There was a small, circular hole at the top of the screen, just a few millimeters in diameter.

At first, I thought this might have been some kind of manufacturing defect, but it wasn't until I lifted the screen again that I realized what was going on. Beneath the screen, on the inside of the phone, was a tiny camera lens that had somehow managed to become dislodged from its proper place.

After doing some research, I learned that the iPhone 6 (and many other iPhones) have a small front-facing camera that allows the user to take better selfies and make clearer video calls. Without this camera, the front-facing camera would become clouded and blurry, making it almost impossible to capture clear images.

The third-party repair shop that had done the screen replacement had evidently not properly secured the camera lens before installing the new screen. Luckily, I was able to remove the screen and reposition the camera lens without causing any permanent damage to the phone, and now it works perfectly.

The experience taught me a valuable lesson: when it comes to repairing and maintaining expensive electronics like the iPhone, it is always better to have a professional do the work. Even if it means paying more for an authorized repair, it could save you from encountering frustrating and potentially costly mistakes down the road.

In conclusion, carefully replacing a cracked iPhone screen by yourself may seem simple and easy, but it may lead to unforeseen complications. Therefore, it's always better to rely on professionals so that you don't end up with a disaster like mine.

## Chosen Solution
 So I replaced the screen of my iPhone 6 with an afermarket screen, everything went fine exept for the fact that the screen is slightly lifetd exposing about 1mm of the plastic fram. The case doesn’t seems to be bent. Any idea why? thank you very much

 then it's most likely the screen. Its not uncommon for aftermarket screens to be a little thicker than the original
