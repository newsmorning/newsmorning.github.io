As an iPad 6 user, I can confidently say that I love every inch of this device. It has been my go-to tool for every activity that I engage in. From browsing to gaming, and even work-related tasks, it has never failed me. However, over the past few weeks, I have been experiencing some insane glitching that has left me baffled. In this article, I will describe in detail the glitches that my iPad 6 has been experiencing.

The first glitch that I encountered was the screen freezing up. It would not respond to any touch commands, and I had to restart the device every time it happened. At first, I thought it was a software issue, and I tried resetting it to its factory settings, but the problem persisted. This meant that it was a hardware problem that required some expert attention.

Another issue that I encountered was the home button failing to respond. When I pressed it, it would not take me to the home screen, and I had to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to get to the home screen. This was quite frustrating, and it slowed me down every time I wanted to access my home screen. 

The third issue that I encountered was the keyboard not responding correctly. When I was typing a message, some letters would appear twice, while some would not appear at all. This meant that I had to proofread every message that I typed, which was tedious and time-consuming. 

The fourth issue that I encountered was the battery life draining rapidly. Even when the device was not in use, the battery would drain at an alarming rate. This was quite strange since I had not installed any new apps or made any changes to the device's settings. 

Lastly, I encountered an issue with the camera. Whenever I opened the camera, the device would freeze up, and I had to restart it. This was quite frustrating, especially when I wanted to take a quick picture.

In conclusion, the glitches that I have been experiencing on my iPad 6 have been quite frustrating, to say the least. While some of these issues can be attributed to aging hardware, it is quite possible that they are software-related. If you are experiencing similar issues with your iPad 6, it is essential to seek expert attention to diagnose and fix the problem.

## Chosen Solution
 When I turn the ipad 6 on or on the main screen to would keep moving to the left.  Or if I'm on the Netflix it would keep going the show backward. The screen was cracked but is fit and still doing the same thing.

 This indicates a cracked digitizer screen. The device will do something we call ghosting. Which is the iPad acts on its own because of an short in the screen. A screen replacement should fix the issue.
