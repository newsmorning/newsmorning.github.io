First and foremost, Android 5.0 Lollipop brings a brand-new visual design to your phone's interface. Called Material Design, this new style is bolder, brighter, and more intuitive than ever before. Buttons and icons are cleaner and flatter, while animations and transitions are smoother and more responsive.

Updated Notifications

Android 5.0 Lollipop also brings a complete overhaul of the notifications system. You can now view and respond to notifications right from the lock screen, and you can choose which alerts to prioritize and silence. What's more, notifications from different apps can now be grouped together, creating a more organized and efficient user experience.

More Intuitive Multitasking

With Android 5.0 Lollipop, multitasking is more intuitive and seamless than ever before. You can easily switch between apps with the new Recent Apps button, and each app can now have multiple "cards" open at once, allowing you to quickly switch between different tasks without losing your place.

Whether you're a power user or just someone who wants a sleek, efficient operating system, Android 5.0 Lollipop is sure to impress. If you own a compatible phone, be sure to download the latest upgrade and see for yourself the incredible new features that await.

 - Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 had one major update, which was 4.4 KitKat from 4.3 JellyBean. Samsung usually doesn’t give more than one major updates for its mid-range devices, but at least we can have hope.
