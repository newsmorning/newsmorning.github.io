# You Won't BELIEVE What Happened When I Replaced My Iphone 6S Battery - Home Button & Touch ID GONE?!?!

As an iPhone user, I’ve always been fascinated with the latest features and upgrades of Apple devices. And with each iteration of the iPhone, comes a new set of improvements that we iPhone users simply can’t resist. But what happens when something goes wrong with our beloved iPhone? 

Recently, I noticed that my iPhone 6S wasn’t holding a charge like it used to, and I knew it was time to replace the battery. After scouring the internet for the best DIY techniques, I decided to replace the battery myself. Little did I know that this decision would lead to a drastic change in my iPhone's functionality.

I followed the necessary steps to replace the battery with a new one, and everything seemed to go smoothly. However, when I turned on my iPhone, I immediately noticed something was off. The home button and the Touch ID feature were no longer functioning. It was as if they had disappeared into thin air!

I was in complete shock and couldn’t believe that my iPhone could undergo such a drastic change just by replacing the battery. After some research, I discovered that this issue is a common problem for iPhone users who replace their own battery. Apparently, there is an issue with the technology used in the Touch ID sensor of the iPhone 6S that makes it virtually impossible to replace the battery without causing damage to the home button and Touch ID.

Feeling defeated and frustrated, I decided to take my iPhone to a professional technician to see if they could fix the issue. After examining the phone, the technician confirmed that the issue was, in fact, caused by the replacement of the battery. 

Luckily, the technician was able to fix the issue, but it came at a hefty price. I had to pay for a completely new home button and Touch ID sensor to be installed, which cost me a pretty penny. 

Looking back, I wish I had done my research more thoroughly and perhaps opted to take my iPhone to a professional technician in the first place. Ultimately, I learned a valuable lesson about the risks of DIY phone repairs and the potential consequences that can come from not seeking professional help.

To sum up, if you're an iPhone 6S user looking to replace your battery, it’s best to seek the help of a professional technician to avoid any potential issues with your home button and Touch ID sensor. While it may seem like a daunting task, trust me, it’s worth the investment in the long run.

## Chosen Solution
 Not sure what my next course of action should be. I checked all the cables, everything seems okay. I was extra careful and didn’t bend the screen past 90 degrees. when opening it. 3D touch still works so I don’t know. The home button doesn’t do anything when pressed and it says Touch ID cannot be enabled on this iPhone. Literally every other function of the phone works perfectly. Never had this issue before. Should I order a replacement screen and try that? Maybe I damaged the flex digitizer cable?

 Check the vertical cable connector at the top right of the board where the screen and everything connect. Make sure there aren’t any bent pins or damage to the cable.
