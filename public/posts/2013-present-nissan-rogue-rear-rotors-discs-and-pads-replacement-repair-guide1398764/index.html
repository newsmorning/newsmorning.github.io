If you own a Nissan Rogue, you must ensure that its brakes are in impeccable condition. A worn-out brake system can be a significant safety hazard for you and your passengers, and it can also put other motorists on the road in danger. To keep your Nissan Rogue’s brake system in excellent working order, you need to replace the rear rotor and pad periodically. In this expert guide, we will show you how to replace your Nissan Rogue’s rear rotor and pad like a pro.\nRequirements:\nNew Rear Rotor and Pad Set. Jack stand and a hydraulic jack. Socket wrench set. Torque wrench. Gloves and safety glasses. Steps: Step 1: Get ready for the job by putting on your gear. Before you begin replacing your Nissan Rogue’s rear brake rotor and pad, put on your gloves and safety glasses. Ensure that your Nissan Rogue is in park mode and turn off the engine.\nStep 2: Lift your car and remove your wheels. Lift your Nissan Rogue off the ground using a hydraulic jack and place the frame on a jack stand. Remove both rear wheels using a socket wrench set.\nStep 3: Take out the old rotor and pad. Loosen the caliper sliders using the socket wrench set and remove the caliper from the rotor. Slide out the old pads and remove the caliper bracket bolts. Take out the old rotor and discard it.\nStep 4: Install the new rotor and pad. Place the new rotor onto the wheel hub and secure it in place using the rotor retaining screw. Attach the caliper bracket and slide in the new brake pads. Reconnect the caliper and tighten the caliper slider bolts.\nStep 5: Lower your car and recheck the brake system. Lower your Nissan Rogue from the jack stand and retighten the lug nuts on both rear wheels using a torque wrench. Start your engine and check the brake system’s functionality by applying pressure to the brake pedal.\nConclusion: Replacing your Nissan Rogue’s rear rotor and pad is a relatively simple process that you can do at home, saving time and money. If you follow the steps outlined in this expert guide, you’ll have a more efficient brake system in no time, ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to check your braking system periodically to ensure that it’s functioning optimally.\nDifficulty\nModerate\nSteps\n4\nTime Required\n2 - 6 hours Sections\n1\nRear Rotors(Discs) and Pads 4 steps Flags\n2\nGrammar Police Embrace your inner English teacher and help improve this guide’s grammar!\nMember-Contributed Guide An awesome member of our community made this guide.

Then loosen the lug nuts, mine was really tight I even applied some heat to a couple to get them loose! Maybe the alloy wheel lug nuts are always easier? Jack the car up and put it on axle stands, you can seen where I placed my stands there did not seem to be a clear single place… If you have the Tin wheel version like me; remove the plastic covers.

Then using a screwdriver or similar tool inserted between the inner pad and the rotor, compress,(push in) the caliper piston as soon as your done close the brake fluid reservoir (the fluid is hyroscopic). The Caliper is held by slider pins with a 14mm head. The top pin is directly in line with the brake hose,(sadistic design Engineer?). I needed to apply a lot of heat with a blow torch to get these loose. So I used a cheap locking wrench to shield the brake hose from heat! Remove the pins with a 14mm socket, note the pin with the rubber at the end is the lower pin. Place the Caliper safely way where the hose will not be strained. The Carrier for the Pads is held by two 17mm bolds, they needed a good deal of heat too before they came loose. Firstly Pop the Hood and open the brake fluid reservoir.

Most Rotors I had dealt with a couple of taps and they could be pulled off. Not These! The rotors seem to have a rust bond to the lugs and the wheel hub. I wasn’t going to hit the rotors hard as it could damage the lugs and the wheel bearing. I used a wire brush attachment on a cordless drill to remove as much rust as I could, a screwdriver to chisel off rust where the rotor met the wheel hub and heated the areas with a blow torch then sprayed them with PB Blaster. Then did the same to the other side. When I could see a gap around the lugs I tapped the rotors loose with a mallet and pulled them off.

I brushed the rust of the metal shield and spayed it with rust converter, then enamel paint I sprayed everything down with brake cleaner. I ground the rust off the places where the pad tins sit and applied a little brake grease to prevent more corrosion from developing under the tins. I cleaned the sliding pins and the holes they sit in with wet and dry, then spayed them clean with brake cleaner. I re-greased the pins and put them back in place (rubber tipped pin at the bottom!) with new boots. I placed a little grease on the contact points of the shoes of the e-brake. I clipped in the pins and reassembled, The job had taken way longer than I thought due to the rust. But this was in upstate NY. I did not have any, but if you have tin wheels may want to put anti-seize grease on the lugs. I just sprayed them with lithium grease once they were fully tightened to help keep the water out. Once the car was back on the ground I applied and unapplied the e-brake a few times to work in the grease at the contact points. Once I had the old stuff off.
