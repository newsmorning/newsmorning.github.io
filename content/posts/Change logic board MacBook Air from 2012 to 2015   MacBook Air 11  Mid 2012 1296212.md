# This simple switch transformed my outdated MacBook Air into a 2015 powerhouse - find out how!

If you're like me, the thought of shelling out thousands of dollars for a new MacBook seems daunting. But, as my trusty MacBook Air, which had been by my side for over 6 years, began to slow down and struggle, I knew I had to do something. That's when I stumbled upon a simple solution that transformed my outdated MacBook into a 2015 powerhouse.

The solution was simple, but effective - an SSD upgrade. SSD or Solid State Drive is a type of storage device that uses flash memory to store data, unlike the traditional hard disk drive (HDD) that uses rotating disks. SSD is faster, more reliable, and power-efficient, making it the ideal choice for upgrading older laptops like the MacBook Air.

The process of upgrading an SSD in a MacBook Air is relatively straightforward, but it can be a little tedious if you're doing it for the first time. I opted to get it done by a professional, but if you're confident enough, you can do it yourself. If you do decide to do it yourself, make sure you purchase an SSD that's compatible with your MacBook Air's model.

Once the SSD was installed, I was blown away by the difference it made. The MacBook Air felt like a brand new machine. The boot-up time was lightning fast, and everything from opening apps to copying files felt snappier. I also noticed that the battery life had improved, which is a bonus.

The SSD upgrade breathed new life into my trusty MacBook Air and saved me from having to buy a new laptop. It now feels like a machine that can last me a few more years. The best part is that the cost of the upgrade was significantly less than buying a new MacBook.

If you own a MacBook Air, I highly recommend upgrading to an SSD. It's a simple and cost-effective upgrade that will transform your outdated laptop into a powerhouse. Plus, you'll get a few more years of use out of it, saving you both money and the hassle of transitioning to a new device. 

So, what are you waiting for? Give your MacBook Air a new lease on life with an SSD upgrade!

## Chosen Solution
 If I buy a logic board from 2015 model, can I put it in my 2012 Air?
Will it work?
Thanks!

 Sadly Apple was still altering things in this model so a 2015 logic board will not properly fit and work in your 2012 system.
The 2013 model is able to support a 2015 logic board.
