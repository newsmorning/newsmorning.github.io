# Is Your iPhone 6's Home Button Cable Broken? Here's How to Fix it Before It's Too Late!

If you own an iPhone 6, you will most likely be familiar with the smooth and responsive touch of its home button. It is the focal point of your device and is used to navigate and access your apps with ease. However, if your home button becomes unresponsive, it may be because the cable connecting it to the logic board has become damaged or broken. This can be frustrating as it affects the overall usability of your iPhone. But don't worry, as there are ways to fix it before it's too late!

## Signs your iPhone 6 home button cable has become damaged

Before we dive into the solution, let's first identify what signs indicate that your iPhone 6 home button cable has become damaged. These include:

- Your home button becomes unresponsive or stops working altogether.
- Your device prompts you with the 'Unable to activate Touch ID on this iPhone' message.
- Your device's 'Hey Siri' function stops working.
- You are unable to enter DFU mode or Recovery mode in iTunes.

If you experience any of these issues, then you may have a damaged home button cable.

## The Solution

The first step to fixing your iPhone 6's home button cable is to identify the problem. A simple way to check if your home button is the problem is to test the device's touch ID by going to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Add a fingerprint. If Touch ID doesn't work or isn't an option, then the home button is the issue.

If you have determined that the home button is the problem, you can try to clean it. Often, dirt or debris can get stuck in the home button, causing it to malfunction. Clean the home button with a soft-bristled brush or a dry cloth.

If cleaning doesn't solve the problem, then you may have a damaged home button cable. Fixing this issue requires the replacement of the home button cable. However, it's recommended that you contact a professional repair service to fix this problem as attempting to repair it yourself may cause more damage to your device.

A professional repair service will typically replace the home button and its cable with genuine parts. This process can be done quickly, and your iPhone 6 will be restored to full functionality.

## In conclusion

Your iPhone 6's home button is essential to your device's overall usability, and a broken cable can impact your user experience. If you notice any of the signs mentioned above, then your home button cable may be damaged. Don't wait before it's too late! Get professional help to diagnose and fix this problem before it leads to more significant issues with your device.

 Hi,
I tried to repair an iPhone 6 from a friend with error 53, after I disassembled the phone and came to the home button part, I see that the cable broke down.

Thanks in advance

 It is impossible for home repairs by now. Either you convince Apple to repair for you, or you perform microsurgery to reconnect the cable.

 oh that's hard one

i don't think it can be repaired at all i would preffer to buy new button...you'll lose touchID but hey that's better than nothing.....
it's near impossible level 3 repair and i don't think any shop can help you maybe somebody buy chanches are small

 This phone will not work without that original home button, you will or when you do IOS update it will respond with the error 53.If you have the original home button you can do a restore and it should work again. The home button is programmed to the motherboard, so without the original that phone is good only for parts. Apple is the only one that can reprogram the home button and the iPhone 6.
