Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Replace the Audio Output Jack on My Sony Dvp Fx730! Shocking Results Revealed!

As a movie and music lover, I always cherish the opportunity to enjoy high-quality audio output while watching or listening to my favorite content. One of the primary means by which I achieve this is by using my Sony Dvp Fx730 audio player, which has never disappointed me in terms of audio performance. However, a few weeks ago, I noticed that the audio output jack on my player was faulty, and I decided to get it fixed. Little did I know that the decision would lead me to experience the most shocking audio results ever!

Being a DIY enthusiast, I opted to fix the audio output jack myself instead of taking it to a professional technician. I purchased a replacement jack and eagerly set out to replace the faulty one. Since I had never done it before, I watch several online tutorials and read more than fifteen articles on how to replace audio jacks. I carefully followed all the instructions I could find and used all the necessary tools that the tutorial videos suggested.

After about forty minutes, I successfully replaced the audio jack and reassembled the player. I then quickly put on some music and played it through headphones to test the new audio jack's quality. To my surprise, the music sounded even better than before! The audio was sharper, clearer, and more vibrant a massive improvement on the original audio output jack.

I decided to test the new audio jack using different headphones, so I connected both earbuds and over-ear headphones to the player. To my astonishment, the quality of audio output through both the earbuds and over-ear headphones was far beyond what I had imagined; the music sounded closer to how it would sound during a live performance in a concert hall!

I could not believe that I had achieved such incredible results with such little effort. However, I did not stop there. I also tried connecting the player to a speaker system, and as expected, the audio output was equally impressive. The bass was more pronounced, the treble crisper, and the balance between the two was perfect.

In conclusion, my decision to replace the faulty audio output jack on my Sony Dvp Fx730 was the best thing that ever happened to my player's audio quality. The improvement was beyond anything I could have imagined or hoped for. The experience has taught me that it is not always necessary to seek professional help when fixing minor faults on our gadgets as even amateurs can do it with little effort and get remarkable results.

 Hi @bobeffect ,
Here’s the service manual for the player.
On p.1 it details the dis-assembly sequence so that you can gain access to the mainboard to replace the audio out jack.
The ifixit Sony DVP-FX730 repair guides may also be of some help.
The part number for the jack is Sony part # 9-885-131-18 -  AUDIO JACK (2N-0003003-FWS0) (AUDIO OUT) - see p.41 parts list.
I tried searching online for the part using the part number with no success. You may have better luck.
The manual is a bit awkward to use online as you have to scroll down and select the next page number and then click on Go to get to the next page or the page that you want. To download the manual you have to sign up to the website.
