I had the connector replaced by a board level repair business, but now the Home Button is not working. The board level repair tech is having trouble finding the solution. I think the Home Button connector needs to be replaced (on the board), but the tech is saying that upon visual inspection, there is no damage. Does anyone have any advice from us regarding what might be the culprit? Thanks P.S.\nWe found this small piece of something in the iPad when it arrived back from the board level repair business. It looks like it might be a piece from the Home Button FPC connector because it is similar in length? Any thoughts on this?\nI agree with Josh W, I’d just complain until they replaced it for free.\n","wordCount":"616","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Scott Umana"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-not-working-after-fcp-connector-board-level-repair-ipad-air-lte-1006142/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't BELIEVE what happened to this iPad after FCP connector board level repair - Home button completely UNRESPONSIVE!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 1, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;616 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Scott Umana</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Article Title: You Won&rsquo;t BELIEVE What Happened to This iPad After FCP Connector Board Level Repair - Home Button Completely UNRESPONSIVE!</p><p>If you are an iPad user, you know how important the home button is for the smooth functioning of your device.
