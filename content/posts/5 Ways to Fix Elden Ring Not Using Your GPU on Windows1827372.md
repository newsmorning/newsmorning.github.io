And that’s not the only issue users reported with Elden Ring. Some said that the game wouldn’t launch, many had the Elden Ring crashing with a white screen, and for others, it wouldn’t show up in the Steam library.
 
Let’s focus on why Elden Ring is not using GPU and explore all the solutions to the problem.
 
## Why doesn’t Elden Ring use GPU?
 
First things first, most users who reported the problem earlier were able to fix things after the recent update. It was supposedly an issue with the game itself, and a patch for it has been released.
 
Also, misconfigured game settings, outdated GPU drivers, or being on a low-performance power plan may be behind Elden Ring not using a dedicated GPU.
 
If you find Elden Ring not using GPU in the Windows Task Manager, verify the same through the utility offered by your graphics card manufacturer. Task Manager has often been found to display incorrect information in this regard.
 
Though if Elden Ring’s low GPU usage on AMD or Nvidia persists, try the solutions listed in the section.
 
#### Can you play Elden Ring without GPU?
 
Many users tried running Elden Ring on the integrated graphics card, and the result wasn’t as bad as expected. In such cases, you can’t expect it to deliver the same performance as it does on a dedicated GPU.
 
The game will lag and stutter, but it will remain playable, as reported by players. So, if you are facing issues with the game, verify the underlying cause before blaming the integrated graphics.
 
## How can I fix Elden Ring if it’s not using GPU?
 
### 1. Update Elden Ring
 
- Launch Steam, and navigate to the Library.
 - Right-click on Elden Ring, and then select Update from the context menu.

 
As discussed earlier, the recent update, Path 1.02.2, to be precise, fixed Elden Ring’s low GPU utilization for most users. In case an update option is not available yet, here’s how you can manually do it:
 
- Right-click on Elden Ring and select Properties.
 - Navigate to the Updates tab.
 - Select High Priority – Always auto-update this game before others from the Automatic Updates dropdown menu.

 
Now, restart Steam, and you should see an update that would fix things if Elden Ring is not using GPU.

 - Select Manage 3D settings from the navigation pane on the left.

### 3. Update the graphics driver
 
If your computer already relies on the dedicated GPU, but you are still facing the problem, it could be the outdated drivers to blame. In this case, the best option would be to update the drivers.
 
Though the manual approach wouldn’t be as feasible since there are a lot of sources for the update, you might not be able to access them all. It would take considerably more time and effort if you somehow do.
 
In this case, using a professional software that updates your drivers automatically had proven to work for many users when the issue was related to faulty drivers. So, do give it a try!
 
To make sure that everything goes smoothly and avoid any kind of GPU driver errors, be sure to use a complete driver update assistant that will solve your problems with just a couple of clicks, and we strongly recommend DriverFix. Follow these easy steps to safely update your drivers:

 - The application will now show you all the drivers that have issues, and you just need to select the ones you’d liked fixed.
 - Wait for the app to download and install the newest drivers.
 - Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.
