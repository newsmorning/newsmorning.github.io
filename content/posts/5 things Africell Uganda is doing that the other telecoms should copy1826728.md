# Revolutionizing the Telecom Industry: Discover Africell Uganda's Top 5 Game-Changing Strategies!

The telecom industry in Uganda has undergone rapid growth and transformation over the years. It has seen increased competition and innovation from both local and international operators. One company that stands out in this industry is Africell Uganda.

Africell Uganda is a leading telecommunications company that has been providing innovative solutions to the Ugandan market since 2014. The company has revolutionized the telecom industry in Uganda by introducing new products, services and strategies that have generated a positive impact on the lives of millions of Ugandans.

In this article, we will take a look at Africell Uganda's top 5 game-changing strategies that have made them a force to be reckoned with in Uganda's telecom industry.

## 1. Affordable Pricing

Africell Uganda's pricing strategy is one of the key reasons they have been able to capture a significant market share in Uganda. The company offers affordable pricing for both voice and data services. This has made it possible for millions of Ugandans to access and utilize telecom services without straining their budgets. 

Africell Uganda offers a variety of packages such as "Data Blasta" which allows customers to access data for as low as UGX 500 (approximately $0.14) for 25MB. This has made it possible for people living in rural and remote areas to access internet services and stay connected with the rest of the world.

## 2. Focusing on Rural Markets

Africell Uganda has also differentiated itself by focusing on rural markets. In a market where other mobile network operators focus mainly on urban areas, Africell Uganda's decision to focus on rural areas has paid off. The company has invested heavily in network infrastructure in rural areas in order to provide connectivity to those areas that were previously underserved. This has given them a significant advantage over other network operators, especially with the increasing demand for mobile internet services in rural areas.

## 3. Innovative Products and Services

Africell Uganda has introduced innovative products and services that have disrupted the market in a positive way. One of their flagship products is the "Bikole Bundles" – a package that allows customers to make calls, send SMS and access the internet for a whole day at an affordable price. The company has also introduced the "My Pakalast" package which allows customers to choose and prioritize their preferred services according to their needs. 

In addition to these products, Africell Uganda has also introduced the "Yoola Amajja" promotion which allows customers to win prizes, cash and bonuses by recharging airtime or buying data bundles. These promotions have not only helped to retain existing customers but also attract new ones.

## 4. Investment in Network Infrastructure

Africell Uganda has invested heavily in network infrastructure to ensure that their customers have access to high-quality services. The company has expanded its 4G network coverage to more areas in the country, providing customers with high-speed internet connectivity. In addition, Africell Uganda has also invested in fiber optic infrastructure to improve the quality of their voice and data services. 

## 5. Customer-Centric Approach

Africell Uganda has adopted a customer-centric approach, which has helped to build a loyal customer base. The company has made it easy for customers to access their services through the "My Africell" self-care portal, which allows customers to manage their accounts, recharge airtime and buy data bundles. 

In addition, Africell Uganda has invested in customer care channels such as call centers, social media, and mobile applications to ensure that customers have 24/7 access to support in case of any issues. All this has helped to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

In conclusion, Africell Uganda has revolutionized the telecom industry in Uganda through innovative products, a customer-centric approach, investment in network infrastructure, focusing on rural markets and affordable pricing. These strategies have helped the company to build a significant customer base in a highly competitive market. Africell Uganda's success is proof that innovation, customer focus and investment in quality are key to success in the telecom industry.


Africell Uganda is among the top
three telecoms in Uganda in terms of subscriber base (as of September 2018) coming
in the third position with 2.1 million subscribers. The first two positions are
occupied my usual suspects MTN Uganda (10.7 million subscribers) and Airtel
Uganda (10.2 million subscribers). Africell Uganda was established in May 2014,
when Africell acquired the majority stake that Orange Telecom owned in its
Uganda cellular network.
 
With just 9% of the total market
share as of September 2018, Africell Uganda has managed to stay in the fiercely
competitive telecoms business. New telecom companies have come in and bowed out,
either selling out to other players or completely abandoning the market.
 
However, Africell Uganda is still here and it is most especially because of its offers that rhyme with its “Don’t Be Cheated” slogan. No one wants to be cheated. Right? Africell Uganda has continued to give its subscribers more value for money with succulent offers.
 
## Here are 5 things Africell Uganda offers that other networks only dream of, and should copy maybe.
 
## Free SIM cards.
 
You have
probably heard the loud speakers announcing that Africell SIM cards and
registration is free when you move around busy trading centers. Yes, Africell
SIM cards are actually free. Whereas this may look like a desperate measure to
gain subscribers, it is something that has helped Africell push from the
initial 1 million subscribers it inherited from Orange to now over 2.1 million.
 
If you look at
it logically, why make a customer pay a price to join the network yet they are
going to purchase your services like data, voice bundles, SMS and pay for mobile
money services? Not to say that other telecoms sell lines expensively, but
something good and free, no one can deny that. Other telecoms should take note.
 
## Africell Uganda Social Bundles with Paid OTT
 
As of June 2017, there were an estimated 20.4 million mobile subscribers out of an estimated population of 39.6 million, a 51.5% penetration rate. By March 2018, the number of mobile phone users had increased to 24.8 million, a 70.9% penetration rate. As of 31 March 2017, Uganda had the 18th highest Internet usage rate in Africa (out of 58 countries).
 
However, the
numbers have reduced considerably due to the introduction of a tax on OTT
services. According to a Hootsuite report, over 2 million people were shed off
from the internet due to the introduction of a tax on social media.
 
Great news for
many is that Africell brought back social media bundles and also pays OTT tax
on those bundles. This is a brave move from a smaller telecom that could bring
back over 2 million people to the internet, yet the big telecoms still shy away
from it.
 
## 4G Specific Bundles.
 
Africell Uganda recently launched crazy 4G bundles where customers are given more data for less to enjoy the marvelous 4G speeds. While 4G specific bundles (only work when network is locked to 4G) may look like a silly thing, it is truly important to customers especially with affordable 4G supporting devices flooding the market.
 
Airtel Uganda
recently announced countrywide 4G coverage, why aren’t they offering customers
something like this? 
 
## Cheaper Data bundles.
 
Many Ugandans are price conscious and Africell understands this. The data competition led to telecoms offering more data at reduced prices, Africell offering double volume data bundles at the same price. The orange and purple network may not have the best monthly data bundles in Uganda but its daily bundles (which many Ugandans use) are very attractive.
 
Even their Friday
bundle (a counter offer to Airtel’s Freaky Friday) is cheaper and bigger than
Airtel’s offer. If Africell can manage cheaper data bundles, then other
telecoms should copy this and help drive the digital transformation in Uganda.
