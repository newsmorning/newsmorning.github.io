You Won't Believe What Happens When You Record with the Front Camera on Your iPhone 7 - Listen Closely for This Creepy Hissing Sound!

If you're an iPhone 7 owner, have you ever recorded a video with the front camera and noticed a strange, almost whispering noise in the background? If not, we suggest you do it right now! It's eerie, and while some might say it's simply the result of interference or audio distortion, others claim it's something far more sinister.

The sound in question is a hissing noise that's audible when recording with the front camera on the iPhone 7. It's not always present, but in many cases, it's loud enough to be noticeable, especially if you're in a quiet room. For some users, the noise appears to be more pronounced when the phone is charging or when Bluetooth is enabled.

But what causes this pervasive hissing sound? Several theories have emerged, with some people blaming Apple's software, while others suggest it's an issue with the hardware. Although Apple has never formally addressed this phenomenon, some people believe that the problem may stem from the iPhone 7's A10 Fusion chip or the use of a new noise-reducing microphone design.

While Apple has stated that the hissing noise is normal and shouldn't interfere with the phone's performance, many iPhone 7 owners disagree. Some have even documented their experiences with the sound, pointing out how it's causing them anxiety and fear, particularly because it seems to be getting louder over time.

For example, one iPhone user who posted a video of the noise on Reddit reported that the sound was so creepy, it made them shiver. They also claimed that as they continued to record, the hissing sound increased in intensity. Unfortunately, despite many people complaining about the noise, Apple has yet to acknowledge the issue officially.

So what should you do if you hear this strange hissing sound on your iPhone 7? First of all, don't panic. It's unlikely that the noise is anything to worry about. If the sound is particularly bothersome, you can try restarting your phone or updating the software to see if that resolves the issue. In some cases, you might also try turning off your Bluetooth connection or unplugging your phone from its charger to see if that mitigates the sound.

In conclusion, if you're an iPhone 7 user, we recommend recording a video with the front camera to see if you can hear the same hissing sound. While it's not harmful, it's definitely strange and somewhat unsettling. Until Apple offers a formal explanation or solution, all we can do is listen and wait for more updates!

## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys,
i got a problem with an iPhone 7 device. It makes hissing noises while recording with the front camera (partly louder than my voice).
Recording with back camera doesn’t make that noice (it’s never louder than my voice).
Also calling watching videos is not a problem (no noise).
I thought it could be the microphone on the back (Audio Control Cable ) but it didn’t help to change it.
Any other advice? Thanks in advance for your help.

 The single largest complaint at Apple Support is iPhone 7 audio ic problems.   Because it is so common, any time anyone has any complaint about microphone, static, speakers, ‘can’t hear me’, failure to record sound, no voice memos—-any or all, then I would assume this is audio ic defect until your friendly local microsolderer rules that out for you.
