# Is Your MacBook on the Brink of Death? Find Out How to Revive It From Liquid Damage with These Simple Steps!

It's every MacBook owner's worst nightmare - spilling liquid on their beloved device. Whether it's a cup of coffee, a glass of water, or even a bottle of beer, liquid damage can wreak havoc on your MacBook's delicate internal components.

But fear not, as there are ways to revive your MacBook from liquid damage. In this article, we'll go over some simple steps you can take to save your MacBook from the brink of death.

## Step 1: Turn Off Your MacBook Immediately

The first step to reviving a MacBook from liquid damage is to turn it off immediately. This will prevent any further damage from occurring and will also give you a chance to prevent any liquid from seeping deeper into your MacBook's internal components.

To turn off your MacBook, hold down the power button until it shuts down completely. If your MacBook's screen has already turned off due to the liquid damage, do not try to turn it back on. Instead, move onto the next step.

## Step 2: Dry Your MacBook

The next step to reviving a MacBook from liquid damage is to dry it out as much as possible. To do this, you can use a soft, absorbent cloth or paper towels to gently dab away any excess liquid from the surface of your MacBook.

Avoid using any harsh fabrics or towels as this can cause further damage to your MacBook's delicate components. You can also use a hairdryer on the lowest setting to dry any hard-to-reach areas.

## Step 3: Remove Your MacBook's Battery

If your MacBook has a removable battery, it's important to remove it as soon as possible to prevent any further damage. This will also give you a chance to inspect your MacBook's internal components for any signs of damage or corrosion.

To remove your MacBook's battery, follow the manufacturer's instructions. If you're not sure how to do this, it's best to take your MacBook to a professional repair service.

## Step 4: Let Your MacBook Dry Completely

After removing your MacBook's battery, let it dry completely before attempting to turn it back on. This may take several hours or even a few days depending on how much liquid was spilled and how much time has passed since the spill.

Do NOT attempt to turn on your MacBook until it has completely dried out as this can cause further damage to your MacBook's internal components.

## Step 5: Test Your MacBook

After your MacBook has dried completely, it's time to test it to see if it's still functioning normally. Reinsert the battery and power on your MacBook. If it turns on normally and all components are working as they should, congratulations - you've successfully revived your MacBook from liquid damage!

If there are still issues with your MacBook, it's best to take it to a professional repair service as there may be underlying damage that needs to be addressed.

In Conclusion

Liquid damage can cause serious damage to your MacBook, but with these simple steps, you can revive your MacBook from the brink of death. Remember to turn off your MacBook immediately, dry it out as much as possible, remove the battery, let it dry completely, and test it to ensure that it's functioning normally. With a little bit of patience and care, you can save your MacBook from liquid damage and get back to using it as if nothing ever happened.

## Chosen Solution
 I have purchased a few water damaged A1342 MacBooks. They were in storage and the sprinkler system came on. They have not had power to them when I got them. I cleaned a couple of the logic boards with alcohol and let them dry overnight. When connected to power, the magsafe led is very dim and will not turn on at all. I know the battery has absolutely no charge. I tried a new dc-in board with the same results (may have purchased a defective board). Will the dead battery cause the macbook not to boot with ac power or should I try another dc-in board?

 Remove the bottom case.
Remove the battery connecter from the logic board.
press and hold the power button
plug the charger into laptop.
wait for 10-15 sec with holding power button and charger ins to it.
release the power button and press it again.
your macbook will sure power up.
this is the process to bypass the SMC which diagnose the whole laptop during starting up. i have a same a1342 with liquid damage . but power up with this process but battery is not working . every liquid damage is working with this process. thnx

 The first thing to do now is reset the SMC and PRAM, and see if it helps:
Hold option, Command, P and R for 25-30 seconds
For the PRAM, refer to the following steps:
Note: Portable computers that have a battery you should not remove on your own include MacBook Pro (Early 2009) and later, all models of MacBook Air, and MacBook (Late 2009).
Shut down the computer.Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected.On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.Press the power button to turn on the computer.Note: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.
If neither helps, board level repair is required, or a new DC-In board (likely both). I would also replace the batteries ASAP if you fix the laptop since it will likely fail prematurely.

 Hi I have a water damaged MacBook pro with dim led on megasafe which I have forced on using the method of disconnecting the battery from the board as outlined above
Now it's started up what is the method to get it back to normal? Battery connected and charging?
Thanks in advance
JJ

 Hey SIMRAN,
I was able to boot up my computer using your method.
It will only boot up if I use your method.
What do I need to do now to fix the computer?
Do I need to replace the battery?
Thanks,
Josh

 hello, i have a water damaged macbook a1278 after i did a isopropyl bath and let it dry thoroughly i get the green light when i plug in the charger but it does not start, not even if i do a keyboard bypass. If i connect the battery though, the laptop powers up by itself and the fan goes in full speed, displaying nothing on the screen. i don't get any sounds either. In orded to turn it off i need to take out the battery.
Any ideas?
many thanks

 Hi Simran,
I have a water damage macbook which had the same dim light and can't smc reset. So i send it to the technician and they changed the keyboard and it was working fine. Then my itchy fingers did a smc reset and not its back to square one. It won't turn on no matter what i do? So do you think its the motherboard now?
