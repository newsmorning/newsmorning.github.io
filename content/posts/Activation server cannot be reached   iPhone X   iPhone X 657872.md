Title: WARNING: Is Your Precious iPhone X Being Held Hostage? Find Out Why Its Activation Server Cannot Be Reached!

Introduction: 

The iPhone X is one of the most advanced and sought-after smartphones in the world. With its impressive features and stunning design, it is not surprising that many people crave to have this device. However, some iPhone X owners have reported an issue where their phone's activation server cannot be reached, leaving their device unusable. This article explores why the activation server cannot be reached and what you can do to fix the problem.

Body Paragraphs: 

So, why can't iPhone X owners activate their devices? The issue lies in the fact that Apple's activation servers may be down or not respond to authentication attempts at times. This can happen due to server maintenance, high traffic, or issues with the device's software, among other reasons. When this happens, the device cannot be activated, making it impossible to use features like calling, texting, or accessing the internet.

If your iPhone X is holding you hostage due to this activation server issue, there are several solutions you can try. Firstly, it's essential to ensure that your device has an active and reliable internet connection. Verify that everything is working well with your Wi-Fi or cellular connectivity. If you are using a Wi-Fi connection, try to reset your router or switch to a different network. You can also activate your device using a cellular connection if a Wi-Fi connection is not available.

You can also try activating your iPhone X using iTunes on your computer instead of activating the device through Wi-Fi or cellular. Connect your device to your computer, open iTunes, and follow the prompts. This method typically works, even when the activation server is down or experiencing problems.

Another solution you can try is putting your iPhone X in recovery mode and attempting to activate it again. To put your device in recovery mode, connect it to your computer with iTunes, then press the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume Down button simultaneously. Keep pressing both buttons until the iTunes icon and a message that says "Connect to iTunes" appears on the device screen. Once you get to this stage, proceed to follow the prompts on the computer to activate your device.

Conclusion: 

In conclusion, the iPhone X is undoubtedly an impressive smartphone, but it could become useless if the activation server cannot be reached. If you're facing this problem, you can try some of the solutions highlighted in this article. Remember to ensure that your device has an active internet connection, try activating it via iTunes, or put it in recovery mode. With these solutions, you can unlock your precious iPhone X and continue to enjoy its advanced features.

## Chosen Solution
 I did a factory reset of my iPhone X after updating to 12.3.1. Since then could not activate the iPhone. Getting the error message as “activation server cannot be reached”. Tried restoring the phone using iTunes using recovery mode and DFU recovery. Still could not activate. Getting the error message as “activation information could not be obtained from the device” on iTunes. Even the apple support or the service centre could resolve the issue. They were saying it’s because of a hardware problem. The only resolution they were suggesting is to replace the unit. I had to pay 64k INR to get a replacement which is 2/3rd of the original price, as my device is out of warranty. Does anyone has a solution for this?

 The “activation information” that couldn’t be obtained from your device may be the information on your phones’s SIM card. Perhaps the 12.3.1 update doesn’t include the drivers for the card. Is there any way you can undo the update and revert back to the older configuration?
