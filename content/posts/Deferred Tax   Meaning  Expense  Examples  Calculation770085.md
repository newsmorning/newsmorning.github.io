Title: Unlock the Secret to Saving Thousands with Deferred Tax! Learn How in Just Five Minutes!

Introduction
Are you tired of constantly paying high taxes and not being able to save much money? In just five minutes, you can learn how to save thousands of dollars by using the deferred tax strategy. This article will explore the concept of deferred tax and how it can help you keep more of your hard-earned money.

What is Deferred Tax?

Deferred tax is a concept that refers to the postponement of paying taxes on income until a later date. This is accomplished by deferring the recognition of income or expenses in suitable circumstances, such as when there is a change in tax rates or when the transaction or asset will not result in immediate tax payments.

For example, let us assume you own a house and are planning to sell it. If you sell the house immediately, you will have to pay taxes on the sale. However, if you decide to wait and sell the home a few years down the line, you can defer paying taxes until that time comes. Additionally, you can use the money you would have paid in taxes to invest or save, allowing you to earn interest while you wait.

Understanding the Benefits of Deferred Tax

The most significant benefit of deferred tax is that it enables you to keep more of your earnings. By deferring your taxes, you have more money to invest or save, which can help you build wealth over time. You can also take advantage of compounding interest, allowing your investments to grow faster and more efficiently.

Deferred tax can work both for individuals and businesses, reducing the amount of taxes paid and providing much-needed cash flow. This strategy can also protect against sudden changes in tax rates and provide a buffer in case of unexpected events.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the power of deferred tax lies in its ability to help you keep more of your earnings. By postponing your taxes and investing your money, you can maximize your savings and earn a higher return on your investments. Whether you're an individual or a business owner, deferred tax is a powerful tool that can help you adapt to changes in the tax code, reduce your tax burden, and keep more of your hard-earned money.

Now that you know the secret to saving thousands of dollars with deferred tax, take the time to explore this strategy further. Consult with a financial advisor or tax expert to understand the specifics of the options available, and start building a financial plan that works for you. With a little bit of planning and some patience, deferred tax can be an incredibly powerful tool for your financial future.

But some differences are permanent and cannot be adjusted—penalties charged by tax authorities.
 
When reported tax exceeds tax payable, it is an asset for the firm. On the other hand, when tax payable exceeds reported tax, it becomes a liability for the business—to be paid off in the future.
 
The gap between reported tax and tax payable is often caused by the method of charging depreciationDepreciationDepreciation is a systematic allocation method used to account for the costs of any physical or tangible asset throughout its useful life. Its value indicates how much of an asset’s worth has been utilized. Depreciation enables companies to generate revenue from their assets while only charging a fraction of the cost of the asset in use each year.

Gaps can be brought out by unrealized revenues and unpaid expenses, as well. A company cannot be taxed till it receives revenueRevenueRevenue is the amount of money that a business can earn in its normal course of business by selling its goods and services. In the case of the federal government, it refers to the total amount of income generated from taxes, which remains unfiltered from any deductions.read more. Similarly, an expense cannot be deducted from the tax assessment (current year) till the company actually pays for the expense.
 
### Types
 
Deferred tax can be broadly categorized into the following two types:
 
#### #1 – Deferred Tax Asset (DTA)
 
Deferred Tax AssetDeferred Tax AssetA deferred tax asset is an asset to the Company that usually arises when either the Company has overpaid taxes or paid advance tax. Such taxes are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and are eventually paid back to the Company or deducted from future taxes.read more (DTA) comes into effect when a company either pays excess tax or pays tax in advance.
 
DTAs account for the timing difference between book profitBook ProfitBook Profit is the profit amount that a business earns from its operations & activities but has not been realized yet.

Tax regulations allow the deduction of some items from the taxable profits and disallow others. When a company’s book profit exceed taxable profit, it ends up paying more taxes. On the balance sheetBalance SheetA balance sheet is one of the financial statements of a company that presents the shareholders' equity, liabilities, and assets of the company at a specific point in time. It is based on the accounting equation that states that the sum of the total liabilities and the owner's capital equals the total assets of the company.read more, DTA is recorded on the asset side. This way, it can be used to reduce taxable income in the future.
 
Following are the various DTA scenarios:
 
- When revenue received in advance is taxed before the revenue is recognized, DTA comes into effect.When accounting proceduresAccounting ProceduresThe accounting procedure is the process of standardized nature that performs a specific accounting function designed to incorporate better risk management policies to complete these functions efficiently.

#### #2 – Deferred Tax Liability (DTL)

This is because taxes get due in one accounting period but are not paid in that period.read more (DTL) comes into effect when the tax payable for the current period has not been paid fully.
 
When a company’s book profits exceed taxable profits, the tax paid is lower than the reported tax. This becomes a liability for the company. Therefore, DTL is the pending tax amount to be paid in the future.
 
Different DTL scenarios are as follows:
 
- When tax authorities consider unpaid expenses for a deduction, DTL comes into effect.When a company represents current profits as future earnings, it avoids taxes in the current period. But the same amount becomes a liability for the future.If dual accounting for depreciation and other expensesOther ExpensesOther expenses comprise all the non-operating costs incurred for the supporting business operations.

### Examples
 
Let us understand the practical application of the concept using examples.
 
#### Example #1
 
Let us assume that a company purchases a new mobile worth $10,000—it has a useful lifeUseful LifeUseful life is the estimated time period for which the asset is expected to be functional and can be put to use for the company’s core operations. It serves as an important input for calculating depreciation for assets which affects the profitability and carrying value of the assets.read more of 10 years. The company uses the straight-line method for both income statements and tax statements. However, the company depreciates the asset at 15%, and the income tax department prescribes a 20% depreciation rateDepreciation RateThe depreciation rate is the percent rate at which an asset depreciates during its estimated useful life. It can also be defined as the percentage of a company's long-term investment in an asset that the firm claims as a tax-deductible expense throughout the asset's useful life.read more.
 
Determine the DTA created because of the difference in rate. The given company reported an EBITDAEBITDAEBITDA refers to earnings of the business before deducting interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, and is used to see the actual business earnings and performance-based only from the core operations of the business, as well as to compare the business's performance with that of its competitors.read more of $5,000, an interest expenseInterest ExpenseInterest expense is the amount of interest payable on any borrowings, such as loans, bonds, or other lines of credit, and the costs associated with it are shown on the income statement as interest expense.read more of $800, and an effective tax rateEffective Tax RateEffective tax rate determines the average taxation rate for a corporation or an individual. For both, there is a similar formula only with variation in considering variables. The effective tax rate formula for corporation = Total tax expense / EBTread more of 35%.
 
Solution:
 
DTA = ($5,000 – 15% * $10,000 – $800) * 35% – ($5,000 – 20% * $10,000 – $800) * 35% = $175
 
Therefore, the reported DTA at the end of the first year is $175.
 
#### Example #2
 
A company owns equipment with a useful life of four years. The equipment is worth $2,000. The company uses the straight-line methodStraight-line MethodStraight Line Depreciation Method is one of the most popular methods of depreciation where the asset uniformly depreciates over its useful life and the cost of the asset is evenly spread over its useful and functional life. read more for depreciation and uses the double-declining methodDouble-declining MethodThe Double Declining Balance Method is one of the accelerated methods used for calculating the depreciation amount to be charged in the company's income statement. It is determined by multiplying the book value of the asset by the straight-line method's rate of depreciation and 2read more for tax reporting purposes.
 
Determine the cumulative DTL reported in the balance at the end of year 1, year 2, year 3, and year 4. For the given company, reported EBITDA and interest expenses are $2,500 and $200, respectively. Also, the applicable tax rate for each year is 35%.
 
Let us draw a table to capture the effect of deferred tax expenses for each year, along with calculations:
 
For year one, a DTL is created—book profits exceed taxable profits. However, in year 2, the reported tax is equal to the tax payable.
 
From year three onwards, reported tax is lower than the tax payable—DTL starts depleting. The reported cumulative tax liabilities stood at $175, $175, $88, and $0 at the end of years 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

It is computed as the difference between the reported income tax and income tax payable. A positive difference is an asset (DTA), and a negative difference is a liability (DTL). Reported income is determined by deducting the expenses and depreciation from the total income pertaining to the accounting period. Tax authorities determine the tax payable by deducting allowed expenses and depreciation from total income.
 
In the balance sheet, DTL appears as a non-current asset. DTL does not have to be paid immediately; it has to be settled at a future date.
 
The benefit of a DTA is realized only in the upcoming accounting periods; therefore, it is not a current asset for the company. On the balance sheet, DTAs are represented as non-current assets.
