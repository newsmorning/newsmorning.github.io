Title: You Won't Believe What Happened After I Changed My Nissan Frontier's Battery! Control Issues Galore!

Subtitle: A cautionary tale about the importance of proper battery replacement in modern vehicles.

Introduction:

Changing the battery in your vehicle is a routine maintenance task that most drivers perform without a second thought. However, what happens when this simple act leads to unexpected control issues in your car? This is precisely what happened to me after I replaced the battery in my Nissan Frontier truck. In this article, I will detail my experience and offer some advice for others who may encounter similar problems.

Body:

Firstly, I should note that my Nissan Frontier is a 2016 model equipped with a sophisticated onboard computer system that controls various aspects of the vehicle, including the throttle response, transmission shifting, and engine performance. These control systems rely on electrical power, primarily provided by the battery, to function correctly.

When I replaced the original battery with a new one, I followed the standard procedure, disconnecting the negative terminal first, replacing the battery, and then reconnecting the terminal. However, when I started the engine, I noticed that several warning lights on my dashboard illuminated, and the engine was running rough.

I performed a quick diagnostic scan using a handheld tool that plugged into the OBD-II port under the dashboard. The tool detected an error code related to the throttle control system, indicating that there was a communication problem between the computer and the throttle body. I cleared the code, hoping it was a one-time glitch, but the problem persisted. The truck was stalling and struggling to accelerate, making it unsafe to drive.

I started researching the issue online, and quickly discovered that my situation was not unique. Many Nissan Frontier owners had reported similar problems after replacing their batteries, particularly on models from 2014 onwards. It turns out that the battery replacement process can create a power surge that disrupts the delicate electronics in the onboard computer system, causing communication errors between different components.

After more investigation, I found that Nissan had acknowledged this issue and had released a service bulletin to its dealerships, outlining a fix that involved installing a special fuse or relay to prevent power surges during the battery replacement process. However, this fix was not widely known among consumers, and many had suffered costly repairs or ended up replacing unnecessary parts to resolve the issue.

Following the service bulletin, I installed the required fuse, and the control issues disappeared, and the truck ran smoothly again. However, I wished I had known about this issue before attempting to replace the battery myself.

Conclusion:

Changing your vehicle's battery seems like a straightforward task, but it can have unforeseen consequences if not performed correctly, particularly in modern vehicles with advanced computer-controlled systems. After experiencing control issues in my Nissan Frontier, I would strongly recommend that people consult their vehicle owner's manual or a professional mechanic for guidance on the battery replacement process, especially for newer models that may require additional precautions. By doing so, drivers can avoid costly repairs and ensure the safety and performance of their vehicles.


## Chosen Solution
 I went to Advance Auto to replace the original battery on my 2011 Nissan Frontier SV 4 wd v6. They plugged in a box into the OBI 2 port. Changed the battery but the positive wasn't tight and when we went to check it pinged and wouldn't start. He took off the positive and retightened. The truck started, but the blower motor was on full and couldn't be controlled. The gauges do not initially work well but after a few seconds they work. Also some small things didn't work, open door alarm, ect. They then changed the fusible link on the positive cable, no change. If you use the power pack on the OBD2 port everything works fine. Remove it and the problems show. What could be the problem? - fuse somewhere to OBD2 port? Looked at all 3 fuse box locations and they seemed fine.

 It was a fuse that controlled the OBD2 port - all fixed

 I have this same issue after changing my battery. How was this fixed? Where was the OBD fuse?
