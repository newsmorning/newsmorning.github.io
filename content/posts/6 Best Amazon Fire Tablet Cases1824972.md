- Children: For gaming, education, or watching children’s contentProfessionals: Using productivity apps, watching content, or reading content while traveling frequentlyStandard Users: Adults who want to keep the tablet in a bag or backpack and use it occasionally while outside of the home

 
Each of these categories of users have very specific needs, which the cases are tailored to handle. We’ll cover each of these categories below.
 
The protective case offers access to all ports, buttons and cameras. It features an adjustable stand that lets kids use it at a viewing or typing angle.
 
The design and ruggedness of this case makes it perfect for kids of any age, even toddlers. It comes in black, blue, pink, purple, and red. Choose any color for about $35.
 
#### Shreborn Lightweight and Shockproof Kid-Proof Cover
 
Designed specifically for the Fire HD 10 tablet, this case by Shreborn is about as rugged and protective as they come. It includes every cutout needed for ports, speakers, and cameras. 
 
The case is made from heavy duty EVA foam which is truly child-proof. It can withstand tremendous shock from drops or hits. There are two feet on the back that will let your child stand the tablet and watch it from a convenient hands-free viewing angle.
 
The unique thing about this tablet case is that it includes a grip handle that makes it very easy for even small children to carry around the tablet without dropping it.
 
The design itself will make any child smile every time they use their tablet. It comes in purple, blue, green, pink, red. Choose your child’s favorite color and pay only about $20 for this case, regardless of color.
 
#### JETech Smart Cover with Auto Sleep/Wake
 
It’s one of the slimmest cases available so that it’s still easy to slip the tablet into your briefcase or purse. The smooth interior protects your tablet’s display from any scratches while traveling, while the synthetic exterior keeps the body of your tablet looking unblemished and new.
 
The tri-fold cover is the best feature for traveling. You can use it in one position to stand the tablet up for normal viewing, or lower it to a lower angle for easy typing. It’s also one of the most affordable, ranging from $16 for black to $22 for other colors.
 
#### MoKo Slim Folding Cover
 
The slim MoKo case is perfect for professionals who are looking for something stylish as well as rugged. This case features a lightweight premium polyurethane leather exterior and a soft microfiber interior. 
 
This provides basic surface protection but don’t expect it to save your table from any serious drops. This shouldn’t be a problem if you carry it mostly inside a bag or briefcase. The magnetic lid will work with the Fire tablet’s sleep and wake feature. It also leaves all of the ports and controls open for easy use.
 
The built-in flip stand lets you use two display angles – either viewing or typing. If you like using a stylus with your tablet, there’s a loop to store it securely. It also has an interior hand strap so you can use the tablet comfortably with just one hand.
 
It comes in 28 patterns, so you can choose a style that suits your taste. This case will run you about $20 for all colors.
 
#### Roiskin Shockproof Protective Case
 
It’s ideal if you’re mostly using the tablet to view entertainment or other content, since it comes with a built-in kickstand on the outside of the case. The kickstand design lets you view the tablet from one of two optional angles.
 
Both layers of protection offer shock and impact resistance that’ll keep your tablet safe even if it falls off a table or chair. It’s rugged enough for carrying around at work or school, and offers enough protection even if the tablet will be used by kids.
 
It comes in seven different stylish colors, all priced at about $10, or $1 extra for black.
 
The slim design includes an innovative fold-out stand that lets you place the tablet in a vertical or horizontal hands-free viewing position. The case also includes the magnetic clasp that keeps the cover closed while also activating the tablet’s sleep/wake feature.
 
The case is made from a premium fabric, with a microfiber interior that’ll keep your tablet and screen free of scratches and clean. Keep in mind that the fabric exterior won’t protect from extreme drops, so treat this case as a fashion accessory rather than true drop protection.
