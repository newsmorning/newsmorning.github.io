If you are a regular user of Facebook, you must have come across several videos that you found interesting but could not listen to the background music or sound effects that accompanied the video. This is where extracting the audio of the video comes in handy. Here are five easy ways to extract audio from Facebook videos in just a matter of seconds.

Method 1: Use an online video converter

Online video converters, such as YouTube to MP3, also work for Facebook videos, allowing you to easily and quickly rip the audio out of Facebook videos. Simply copy and paste the URL of the video into the converter and select the desired format for the audio file.

Method 3: Edit the video in a video editor

Video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere or iMovie, allow you to extract the audio from a video and save it as a separate file. Simply import the Facebook video into the video editor and delete the video track, leaving just the audio track. Then export the audio track as a separate file.

Method 4: Use an audio recorder

Audio recording software, such as Audacity, allow you to record the audio that is playing on your computer. Simply play the Facebook video and press the record button in the audio recording software. Then save the recording as a separate audio file.

Method 5: Find the source of the video

If the video was originally uploaded to YouTube, you can use a YouTube video to MP3 converter to extract the audio from the video. A quick search on Google or YouTube can help you find the original source of the video, making it easier to extract the audio.

In conclusion, extracting audio from Facebook videos is a simple process that can be done using a variety of methods.

But, what if you only want to extract audio from a Facebook video? You can do that with the help of audio converter software.
 
Well, again, we turn towards third-party sites that can help you extract audio from any video on the internet, including Facebook.
 
In this article, we show you the five ways to extract audio from Facebook videos, but in order to do so, you will need to first know how to get the URL from Facebook.
 
### Get a Facebook video URL
 
- On the video that you want to download, click the three dots menu.
 - Select Copy link.
 - Now the video URL is on your clipboard. If you have multiple videos to download, copy all the URLs and save it to a Notepad file.

 
Now let’s take a look at the online services and offline apps that can help you extract audio from a Facebook video.
 
## How can I download audio from Facebook videos?
 
###  Save From – Web integration tool
 
Save from is a good and accessible solution because it lets you download Facebook videos directly from your browser, without requiring you to install software to your PC.
 
Yes, it is a video downloader, but you can always extract audio from the videos using the best MP4 to MP3 converters.
 
It is very easy to use, as you will see in the instructions below. The platform lets you download MP4 and WEBM, and you can select the mpx quality for each video (up to 1080).
 
- Open Save From on your web browser.
 - Enter the copied Facebook video URL.
 - The downloader will process the video link and show the available download options.
 - Click the Download MP4 button to download the video.

 
Save From can be safely used on any major browser. It is also available as a Google Chrome extension.
 
As you download directly from the browser, the video files will go to your designated download folder, or you will have to pick it up on the spot if that’s how your browser is set up.
 
Another nifty feature provided by Savefrom.net is the web integration tool. It lets you create a download button for a video of your choice and place it on your website. The integration script works with YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, and VK.com.

###  Getfvid FB Converter – Free and private
 
Getfvid is similar to Save From, but this one allows you to extract audio from the Facebook video and download it in MP3 format.

 - Enter the Facebook video URL in the search bar.
 - Click on Start and wait for the tool to process the URL.
 - Under Convert To, click the drop-down menu and select MP3.
 - Select the Quality of the MP3 file.
 - You can also trim the video by selecting the Start and End times.
 - Click on Convert.
 - Click the Download button to save the extracted audio file.

 
This tool is specifically created to download Facebook videos and does not work with specialized video platforms such as YouTube or DailyMotion.
 
It lets you download both full video formats (mp4) and audio-only formats (mp3). It offers the option to download in high quality, but also in normal quality, for smaller file sizes.
 
Just as in the case of Savefrom, Getfvid files will be saved in the location you picked in your browser settings.
 
Getfvid is free and private. It does not store any user data or place any limit on the amount of media you can download using the tool. The videos you download are not stored anywhere within the platform either.
 
⇒ Get Getfvid
