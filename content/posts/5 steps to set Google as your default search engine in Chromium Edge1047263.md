Under the "Address bar and search" section, you'll find the option to set your search engine preference. Click on it, and you'll see a list of search engines displayed. Click on "Google" to make it your default search engine.

Step 4: Manage search engine settings

After selecting "Google," you'll be redirected to a page where you can manage search engine settings. Here, you can select how you want to use Google as your search engine, set up search predictions, and choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google.

Step 5: Start searching with Google

Now that you've set Google as your default search engine, you're ready to start using it. Simply type in your query in the address bar, and hit enter. All your searches will now be performed using Google instead of Bing.

In conclusion, switching to Google from Bing as your default search engine on Chromium Edge is super easy and can be done in just a few simple steps. The next time you open your browser, you'll be able to enjoy a seamless browsing experience with your favorite search engine.
