# You Won't Believe Why This Kenmore Microwave's Light Underneath Doesn't Work - And the Solution is Easier Than You Think!

If you own a Kenmore microwave with a light underneath, you may have encountered a problem where the light doesn't turn on. This can be frustrating, especially if you like to check on your food without opening the microwave. However, the solution to this problem may be easier than you think.

What Causes the Light Underneath Your Kenmore Microwave to Stop Working?

A common reason why the light underneath your Kenmore microwave stops working is because of a failed light bulb. When the light bulb burns out, the light won't turn on, even if the microwave still works perfectly fine.

Another possible reason why the light isn't working is because of a faulty light socket. This can happen if the socket becomes loose or damaged over time.

How to Replace the Light Bulb in Your Kenmore Microwave

If the reason why the light underneath your Kenmore microwave isn't working is because of a failed light bulb, then you'll need to replace the bulb. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Unplug your Kenmore microwave from the power outlet.

Step 2: Locate the light bulb. It's usually located at the bottom of the microwave or near the center of the roof.

Step 3: Remove the old light bulb. Depending on the model of your Kenmore microwave, you may need to remove a glass cover, twist the light bulb out, or pull it straight out.

Step 4: Insert the new light bulb. Make sure the new light bulb is the correct size and wattage for your microwave.

Step 5: Test the light. Plug your microwave back in and turn it on to test if the new light bulb works.

How to Replace the Light Socket in Your Kenmore Microwave

If your Kenmore microwave's light socket is faulty, you'll need to replace it. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Unplug your Kenmore microwave from the power outlet.

Step 2: Remove the old light socket. Depending on the model of your Kenmore microwave, you may need to remove a cover or unscrew the socket.

Step 3: Insert the new light socket. Make sure the new light socket is the correct size for your microwave.
