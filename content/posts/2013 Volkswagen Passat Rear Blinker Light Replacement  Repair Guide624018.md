# Say Goodbye to Expensive Mechanic Visits with this Easy 2013 Volkswagen Passat Rear Blinker Light Replacement Repair Guide!

Are you tired of spending a fortune on mechanic visits every time you need to repair or replace something in your car? Well, here's some good news for you – you can save a lot of money by performing some simple repairs yourself. In this guide, we'll show you how to replace the rear blinker light on your 2013 Volkswagen Passat, without the need for a mechanic.

## Tools and Materials Required

Before we begin, let's first make sure we have all the necessary tools and materials handy. Here's what you'll need:

- A replacement rear blinker light bulb (make sure it's compatible with your Passat)
- A screwdriver
- A pair of pliers
- A clean cloth or towel

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Turn off the car: The first step is to turn off your Passat and remove the key from the ignition.

2. Access the light bulb: Open the trunk of your car and look for the tail light assembly located on the side where you need to replace the bulb. You should see a plastic cover that's held in place by clips or screws. Use a screwdriver to unscrew the cover or gently pry off the clips to remove it, so you can access the light bulb.

3. Remove the old bulb: Use a pair of pliers to gently twist and pull the old bulb out of its socket. This may require a bit of force, but be careful not to break the bulb or damage the socket.

4. Clean the socket: Before you insert the new bulb, take a moment to clean the socket. Use a cloth or towel to wipe any dirt or debris off the contacts.

5. Insert the new bulb: Now it's time to insert the new bulb. Simply hold it by the base and insert it into the socket. Then, give it a gentle twist to secure it in place.

6. Test the new light: Once the bulb is inserted, test the new light by turning on your Passat's headlights and checking if the blinker light is functioning properly.

7. Replace the cover: If the new bulb is functioning correctly, it's time to replace the plastic cover over the tail light assembly. Simply push the clips back into place or screw the cover back on using your screwdriver.

Congratulations! You've successfully replaced the rear blinker light on your 2013 Volkswagen Passat. By doing this simple repair yourself, you've saved yourself a lot of money that you would have spent on a mechanic's labor costs. This goes to show that sometimes, all you need to make your car run smoothly is a little bit of DIY effort.

## Introduction
 
A proper functioning blinker light tells the drivers behind your vehicle what you plan on doing, as well as bringing you to the attention of drivers if your on the side of the road through the hazard lights.
 
Before using this guide, make sure to purchase the replacement light bulbs.  LED light bulbs have proven to be brighter, more efficient, and longer lasting. The only downside an LED has to a traditional light bulb is price, as LED’s tend to be more expensive. The choice is up to you.
 
Although no tools are required, a small, wet rag helps clean up some old and grimy dust. A flashlight can also be used if sufficient light isn’t available.
 
Before starting this guide, be sure to park the vehicle in a safe and well-lit location, and preferably in the shade to keep yourself cool while working.
