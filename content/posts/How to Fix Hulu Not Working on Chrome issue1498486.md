Hulu is one of the most popular American streaming services, providing its users with an extensive range of movies and TV shows. It is compatible with almost every device and web browser, including Google Chrome. However, sometimes, the platform might crash or fail to run on Chrome due to several reasons.

Here are a few potential reasons why Hulu may not be working on Chrome:

1. Outdated Chrome browser: Your Chrome browser may not be updated to the latest version, causing compatibility issues with Hulu.

2. Cache and cookies: Accumulated cache and cookies over time can also create issues with Hulu's functionality on Chrome.

3. Ad-blockers interfering: Some third-party extensions such as ad-blockers may interfere with Hulu and prevent it from functioning correctly.

4. Network and connectivity issues: Any network issue such as slow internet connection or lack of connectivity can also cause Hulu to stop working on Chrome.

Now, let’s dive into some ultimate solutions to fix Hulu not working on Chrome.

1. Clear cookies and cache: To do this, open Chrome, then click on More (three-dotted icon) in the upper right corner. From the drop-down menu, select More Tools> Clear Browsing Data. Check the boxes next to "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files," then click "Clear data."

2. Disable ad-blockers: Click on the ad-blocker extension icon on the upper right corner of your browser, then click on "pause" or "disable" the extension for your Hulu website.

3. Disable Chrome extensions: Disabling all Chrome extensions temporarily can also help fix any compatibility issues with Hulu. To do this, open your Chrome browser, then click on More> More Tools> Extensions. Once you’re in the extension’s settings, disable all of them.

4. Update Chrome browser: Ensure that your Chrome browser is updated to the latest version. If not, go to Settings> About Chrome> Check for updates.

5. Check network connectivity: Ensure that your network connectivity is stable and functioning correctly. If you have connectivity issues, try resetting your router, or contacting your ISP.

6. Restart Chrome: If none of the above solutions work, then try restarting your Chrome browser and try again.

In conclusion, Hulu not working on Chrome can be frustrating, but it is relatively easy to troubleshoot.
