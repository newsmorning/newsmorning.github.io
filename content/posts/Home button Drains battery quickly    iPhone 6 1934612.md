If you're reading this article on your iPhone 6, chances are you've experienced the frustration of a dwindling battery life. Despite tweaking settings and limiting usage, you may find yourself constantly searching for a power outlet. What if we told you that the culprit behind your iPhone 6's battery troubles may be something as simple as your Home button? 

According to a recent report by Apple, the Home button on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus could be secretly draining your battery life. This is due to the way Apple designed its hardware and software on these devices, with the Home button constantly "listening" for Touch ID fingerprint scans and enabling Siri voice commands. 

As a result, the Home button is constantly using small amounts of power, even when not in use. Over time, this can add up and result in significant battery drain. 

So, what can you do to prevent this from happening? One option is to disable Siri and Touch ID, which will reduce the amount of power your Home button is using. To do this, go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and turn off the options for Touch ID and Siri. 

Another option is to use AssistiveTouch, a feature within iOS that can replace the physical Home button. This feature creates a virtual Home button on your iPhone's display, which you can use instead of the physical button. To enable AssistiveTouch, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch and toggle the switch to ON. 

Additionally, simply using your iPhone less frequently can also help extend your battery life. Consider turning off notifications for apps you don't use often and limit the number of apps running in the background. 

In conclusion, if you're struggling with battery life on your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, don't overlook the role of the Home button in draining power. By taking these simple steps, you can prolong your battery life and save yourself the frustration of constantly searching for a power outlet.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi
My iphone 6 is draining battery very fast ! and after I tried my things and solutions I figured out that once I attached the home button it drains battery very quickly and after I use the device without it the draining is normal ! I replaced the home button and I still have the same issue! Any Ideas ?? Or solutions ?
Thank you.

 Any damage to the phone?  Drop or water damage?
I'm trying to think of a way the home button could drain power and I'm not seeing how it could.  It pulls next to no power at all from the board.
The only thing I can come up with is possible some bent pins on the flex cable that runs along the backplate or some kind of tear or short in that cable that is causing the drain.  I'd try replacing the flex (and backplate if you can't buy them separate).
Also, put your original home button back on so you can have TouchID and avoid iTunes errors.
