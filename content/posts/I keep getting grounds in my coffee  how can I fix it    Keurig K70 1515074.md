## Chosen Solution
 Coffee grounds keep showing up in my coffee and I don't know why.

 It is possible that coffee grounds may have collected in the exit needle of your Keurig.  This might result in residual grounds in your drink every time you brew a cup.

This guide corresponds to a different keurig, but the process of cleaning the needle is the same.  Once you have reached the exit needle component, you can push the end of a paper clip (or similar object) through the exit needle to purge it of any debris.
After the needle is clear and the Keurig is put back together,  descale your brewer to rinse everything out.
