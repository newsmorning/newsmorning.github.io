# You won't believe what I lost on my iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi! The missing link to keeping your device safe...

As a digital assistant, I have seen countless cases of people losing their valuable data from their iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi. It's a nightmare to lose something that contains all your irreplaceable pictures, contacts, important documents, and other crucial data. It's even worse when you don't have a backup.

But it's not just the data loss that's troublesome. iPads are expensive devices, and losing one due to theft or carelessness can be heartbreaking. That's why it's essential to have a good backup plan and a reliable security solution that can keep your iPad safe.

Today, I want to talk about the missing link in keeping your iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi safe that many people overlook: a VPN. Yes, you read that right. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help you protect your device and secure your data.

A VPN works by encrypting your internet traffic and routing it through a secure tunnel. It hides your IP address and location, making it difficult for anyone to track your online activities. With a VPN, you can access the internet without worrying about cybercriminals, snoops, or hackers stealing your data.

But that's not all. A VPN can also help you bypass geo-restrictions and access online content that may be blocked in your region. For instance, if you are traveling abroad and want to watch your favorite TV show or use a banking service that is not available in your new location, you can use a VPN to connect to a server in your home country and access those services.

More importantly, a VPN can help you stay safe on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, your data is vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals. With a VPN, you can encrypt your traffic and protect your sensitive information from prying eyes.

So, if you haven't already, consider getting a VPN for your iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi. There are many VPN providers available, but make sure to choose a reliable and trustworthy one. Look for a provider that offers a no-logging policy, strong encryption, and fast and reliable servers.

In conclusion, losing your iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi is a nightmare, but losing your valuable data can be devastating. To keep your device safe and your data secure, invest in a good backup plan and a reliable VPN. With a VPN, you can browse the internet without worries, access geo-restricted content, and stay safe on public Wi-Fi networks. Don't overlook this missing link in your iPad's security.

## Chosen Solution
 I misplaced the silver protective display connector cover, can I use electrical tape to give it some support? I know under normal circumstances the cable connectors should pop out but wanted to know if this would work? Also, is there anywhere I can buy those MB protective covers?

 electrical tape will be fine. I’ve opened up iPads before that have been repaired(screen replacements) and put them back together without those covers and they all didn’t have any issues working. The only thing that is quite important though is the battery screw.
