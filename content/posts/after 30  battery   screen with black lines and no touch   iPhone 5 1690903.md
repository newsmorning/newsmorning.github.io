The Problem with iPhone 5 Batteries

The iPhone 5 uses a lithium-ion battery, which is designed to last for a long time. However, over time, the battery will begin to degrade. This is because of the way lithium-ion batteries work. Each time you charge and discharge your iPhone's battery, some of the energy is lost. This loss of energy causes the battery to wear down over time.

One problem that can occur as a result of battery wear is the appearance of black lines on the iPhone's screen. These lines can appear anywhere, and they usually get worse over time.

The Secret Solution to Fix Black Lines and No Touch After 30 Battery Cycles

If your iPhone 5 is suffering from black lines and no touch after 30 battery cycles, there is a secret solution that can help. The solution is to replace the iPhone's battery. When you replace the battery, you will be able to fix these issues and make your iPhone 5 as good as new.

Replacing the battery on an iPhone 5 is quite easy, and you can do it yourself if you have some basic tools and a little bit of technical know-how. There are many guides available online that can help you with this process. If you're not comfortable doing it yourself, you can also take your iPhone to a professional repair shop.
