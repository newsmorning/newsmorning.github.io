2. Introduction – The opening paragraph should set the tone of the article and introduce the core topic. It should be engaging and intriguing enough to encourage the reader to read the rest of the content.

3. Body – The body of the article is the primary section where the writer delves into the main topic of the article.

In this article, we will focus on the reasons why the Lenovo A8 50 fails to open despite being fully charged.

4. Conclusion – The conclusion should sum up the main points and encourage the reader to take action or provide additional resources for further reading or investigation.

Body:

If your fully charged Lenovo A8 50 still refuses to start up, there could be several causes. Some of the most common ones are:

1. Power Button Malfunction – The Lenovo A8 50 has a power button that can go bad after extensive use. If the power button isn't working correctly, the device may fail to start up despite being fully charged. You can find out if this is the cause by pressing and holding the power button for a long time. 

2. Battery Issue – The battery is the lifeline of any device, and a faulty battery can cause your Lenovo A8 50 to fail to start-up despite showing a full charge. Often, this issue arises when the battery has reached the end of its lifespan. If this is the issue, you need to replace the battery with a new one.

3. System Glitch – Any device can experience a glitch, and your Lenovo A8 50 isn't an exception. It's possible that the Android operating system has developed issues that are causing the device to refuse to start. A factory reset is one option to fix this problem.

4. Screen Issue – Your device could also have a faulty screen. If it's damaged or cracked, it may result in the device failing to start despite being fully charged. Try shining a flashlight on the display or plugging it into an external display to see if the problem lies solely with the screen.

Conclusion:

In summary, if your Lenovo A8 50 doesn't start up despite being fully charged, there could be several reasons, including power button malfunction, battery issue, system glitch, and screen malfunction. Understanding these causes and finding solutions can save you from spending a considerable amount of money buying a new device. If you need more support, contact Lenovo customer care.

## Chosen Solution
 Not used since 2016.  Charged it (May not be original cables). The brand comes up on screen, plays a tune with animation, and then brand just stays on screen. Tried holding power button for 20 sec. Screen goes blank for a few seconds, then back to the brand screen again. Any suggestions?

 Sounds like your device is going into a boot loop stage. Because of this, you may have to perform a factory reset or clear the cache partition, both being done in the recovery menu. While the device is completely powered off, you can enter the recovery menu by holding both the power and volume up button simultaneously until a menu appears on the screen. From there, you will have options for both. To move around, volume up  us the up key, and down is down, with power or tapping of the screen being select.  First, I would recommend that you clear the cache partition (doesn’t wipe any data on the device) and see if it is fixed. If not, perform a factory reset, which will wipe all data.  Hopefully this will help you get your device back to a  normal state.

 Hi @clairebowen ,
The battery may not be in the best condition even if it shows that it is fully charged as these types of batteries need to be charged regularly to be kept in a good condition as they may fail when under load etc if left for a long time without being charged.
What is the battery charge state after you charge the battery and then attempt what was suggested before? Has it dropped significantly?
If it falls quickly perhaps the battery needs to be replaced before attempting anything
Since a factory reset hasn’t resolved the problem try reloading the firmware and check if that works.
Note the disclaimer in the link regarding doing this at your own risk. Just so that you’re aware of this.
