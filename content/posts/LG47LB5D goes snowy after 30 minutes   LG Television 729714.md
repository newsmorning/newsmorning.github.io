Title: BREAKING: LG Television Freezes Over After 30 Minutes - Is Your LG47LB5D Next?!

Introduction:

In the world of electronics, LG is undoubtedly one of the most prominent brands. With its exceptional quality and advanced features, LG products have always been the number one choice for technology enthusiasts. However, recent reports have claimed that LG television models, particularly the LG47LB5D, are facing an alarming issue where they freeze over after thirty minutes of continuous operation. This sudden and widespread issue has raised concerns among LG TV owners, causing them to wonder whether their beloved LG47LB5D is next in line to suffer the same fate. In this article, we will explore the reason behind this issue and what measures you should take to protect your LG TV from freezing over.

The Cause Behind LG Television Freezing:

As per the reports, the reason behind LG television models freezing over is a faulty motherboard. The motherboard is the central hub that controls the TV's various functions, including processing graphics and displaying images. A defect in the motherboard could lead to components failing and ultimately causing the entire television to freeze over. LG47LB5D has been particularly vulnerable to this issue, but it is not limited to this model alone. Several other LG TV models have also reportedly experienced this problem.

Prevention Measures:

If you own an LG TV – especially an LG47LB5D – you must take proactive steps to prevent it from freezing over. Firstly, avoid prolonged usage of the TV; ensure that you switch off the TV every few hours and give it adequate rest time. Secondly, ensure that the TV is placed in a well-ventilated area; this reduces the risk of heat accumulation, which could lead to components malfunctioning. Thirdly, observe how your TV behaves after prolonged usage; if you notice any unusual sounds or glitches, turn off the TV immediately and seek professional assistance.

What Should You Do If Your LG TV Freezes Over?

If you have encountered the dreaded issue of your LG TV freezing over, don't panic! The first thing you should do is unplug the TV and let it rest for a while. This allows the components to cool down and resets the system. If the problem persists upon restarting, it's time to get a professional to check your TV to diagnose and repair the fault. You should not attempt to fix the issue yourself as this could potentially cause further damage to the TV.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, LG TV owners must be aware of the LG47LB5D's vulnerability to freezing and take preventive measures to avoid this issue. In the event that your LG TV freezes over despite your best efforts, do not attempt to fix it yourself. Always seek professional help to rectify these issues to ensure that your TV runs smoothly for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello everyone.  I'm new to this forum and looking for some help.  I have an LG47LB5D that goes snowy after 30 minutes with a whineing noise, and then the picture comes back for a bit, but it keeps happening.  The set gets very hot.  I have replaced 7 caps that were bulging but that didn't help.  Any help would be fantastic.
Update (08/14/2020)
Thanks for the quick reply.  I can't tell exactly where the noise is coming from, but it does wind down in pitch before the picture comes back.  As far the heat goes, it has always been a hot tv, so maybe it's just me.  I did clean up some brownish areas on some solder.  I'm going to guess this would be flux?  Here are the pictures from both boards.

I tried to touch up the solder joints as best I could.  Let me know if these will work.  Running out of time today.  I will test it out later.

 Hi @glenfricker ,
Don’t know the answer but a whining noise may be the SMPS power supply (presumably this is where the bulging capacitors were replaced) and the display going snowy would be the mainboard or perhaps the power supply to the mainboard.
Check where the noise and the heat are coming from. If it is getting hot enough hopefully there may be some tell tale heat marks on the circuit boards. (check both sides)
Post some close up images of the power board and the mainboard back here. (both sides). Here’s how to do this Adding images to an existing question
Also this may be an option to consider as it should have the schematics for the power board at least. (I couldn’t find a free manual online, you may have better luck).
Be safety aware when working in the back of a TV as there is exposed lethal AC voltage on the power board when the power is connected to the TV

Hi @glenfricker ,
The only thing that I think that I can see but may be totally wrong is some suspicious looking solder joints on the power board. They look like dry joints but maybe it is just the picture or more likely my eyes.
Try reworking them with a soldering iron and check. There may be others that I missed but if these don’t look quite right to you as well, check over the power board for any more.
Here’s a composite of two images from the power board showing the zoomed in image, so you may have to look at the component designation to find the component.
