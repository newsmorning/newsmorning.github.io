Timing is essential in Little Nightmares 2, especially when dealing with the mannequin hands. Observe the patterns of the hands and the time gaps between their movements. Once you identify these, it becomes easier to move through the area in between the gaps and avoid getting grabbed.

4. Distractions

Another effective way to avoid getting grabbed by the mannequin hands is to create distractions. Use objects like cans or bottles to create noise and distract the hands, giving you ample time to move through the area unnoticed.

5. Stay Calm

Lastly, and most importantly, stay calm. The Hospital area can be nerve-wracking, but staying calm is the key to your success. Keep a clear mind and focus on your objective, and you will come out victorious.

In conclusion, the Hospital area in Little Nightmares 2 can be a challenging and terrifying experience, but with the right skills and techniques, you can conquer the mannequin hands and survive the area.
