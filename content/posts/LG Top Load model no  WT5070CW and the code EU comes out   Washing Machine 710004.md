## Chosen Solution
 I have a LG Top Load model no. WT5070CW and the code EU comes out and the washer keeps jumping back and forth with water loads . It seems like it is finished and then it starts filling up with water again.What do i do?
Update (06/10/2021)
I called a repair man and he said for me to buy a new washer because the sensors are all haywire ? Is this true?  Is there no easy fix?

 Hi,
There is no EU error code showing in the washer’s service manual error code list, so it may be a control board problem.
Perhaps running the washer’s diagnostic test program may help to narrow down what’s happening.
