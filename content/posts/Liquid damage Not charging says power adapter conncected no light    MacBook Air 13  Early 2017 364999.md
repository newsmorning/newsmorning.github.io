## Chosen Solution
 I spilled milk on my laptop (not too much) it shut down on its own. I let it dry over night next day the file and ? screen came up by that after noon it turned on normally. I brought it to the apple store they plugged in something and did a diag test and said nothing was wrong on that. Runs of batter power fine but when it is plugged in the charger light does not come on (tried multiple chargers). When plugged in it says “battery not charging power source: power adapter”
**Images are before and after cleaning**

 It’s a blown vcc main rail that reads the battery in when you connect the cable to charge. You’ll need a microsolder technician to diagnose the board and repair the issue

 Your images are not sharp enough in detail to see much. It does look like the I/O board got most of the damage (bottom part of image) MacBook Air 13" (Mid 2013-2017) I/O Board and its cable MacBook Air 13" (Mid 2013-2017) I/O Board Cable. I would replace both.
