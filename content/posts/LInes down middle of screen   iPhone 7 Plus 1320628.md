You Won't Believe What's Causing the Mysterious Lines Down the Middle of iPhone 7 Plus Screens!

Apple has been known for its innovative technology and sleek designs. However, as great as the iPhone 7 Plus is, it is not immune to issues. One such problem is the appearance of mysterious lines down the middle of the screen.

If you're an unfortunate victim of this issue, you might have noticed the lines appearing out of nowhere or after a small drop. Though this problem is specific to the iPhone 7 Plus, it's not uncommon for phone screens to face similar issues. Let's take a closer look at the problem and the possible causes, so you can know what to do if you face this issue.

What are the Symptoms?

The problem is quite evident as it shows in the form of several thin, horizontal lines running across the screen, typically starting from the top of the display and trailing downwards. The lines are not always in the exact middle but are spaced slightly apart, creating a box within the screen.

These lines remain visible regardless of whether the device's screen is displaying light or dark content, creating a significant hindrance for the user. It's tough to understand precisely why this issue occurs, but there are several possible causes.

Possible Causes

The iPhone 7 Plus screen lines down the middle issue can happen due to several reasons, including hardware failure, software glitches, or physical damage. Here are some of the possible reasons why this may be happening.

Hardware Component Failure:

The iPhone 7 Plus screen comprises several components, including the display, logic board, ribbon cables, and CPU. If any of these parts fail to perform accurately, it may trigger the appearance of the horizontal lines.

Software Glitches:

Software is the soul of any iOS device. However, a faulty update or malware infection may lead to stability issues that can lead to graphical errors on the screen.

Physical Damage:

Physical damage to the phone is the most common factor that causes issues such as horizontal lines across the display. Whether you sat on your iPhone or dropped it, physical damage to the phone's screen can cause numerous display issues.

How to Fix It?

The appropriate resolution for the iPhone 7 Plus display line issue largely depends on the cause of the problem. Here are some possible fixes you can try.

Option 1: Hard Reset

First off, you can try to restart the iPhone and see if the glitch resolves itself. A hard reset can help flush out any software anomalies and help restore the phone to its original settings.

Option 2: Restore in iTunes

If the issue is with the software, you may need to restore the device through iTunes. It will erase all data and settings on your iPhone, so be sure to make a backup beforehand.

Option 3: Repair or Replace the Screen

If the issue is caused by physical damage, then repairing or replacing the screen is your only option. Take your phone to a reputable service centre for repair or replacement.

Conclusion

The appearance of horizontal lines across the iPhone 7 Plus display is undoubtedly frustrating, but it's not uncommon. The problem can occur due to various reasons, including hardware failure, software glitches, or physical damage. Depending on the type of cause, you can try any of the mentioned fixes to get rid of the problem. Always be sure to back up your device before attempting any fix. Remember that proper care and handling of your iPhone can help prevent future issues.

## Chosen Solution
 Phone has lines down the middle of the screen, would it need a screen replacement although nothing is cracked on the screen? or is something just not connected inside, ? and lets say i have to take the screen off to connect something inside, is there anything i need to order from here to make sure the screen sticks back on??
thank you

 if you have waranty let apple fix it, otherwise you can try to clean connectors of lcd and reseat the connectors, if that doesnt help you need a new lcd screen.

 This happens with mainly IPads but this has happened to me before.
Have you tried:  
- hard reset: Press and hold both the Sleep/Wake button and the   
Home button for at least ten seconds, until the Apple logo appears.   
- Restoring the iPhone : see page 140 of IPhone User's Manual. It is done via iTunes.
If you have had a screen replacement try these:
check the connection between the flex cables and the logic board If the connectors are obstructed by dust or debris, try to clear them away with a brush and rubbing alcohol. If the connectors are damaged or the flex ribbon is bent over 90°, well, a replacement is needed. After checking those, reconnect the flex cables to the motherboard, making sure the connectors are properly connected.
possibly the IC on the display is damaged if both of the above methods don’t help. Check the part on the top left and right corners in particular. If there’s any damage or one of them has been crushed or the IC has been damaged then your part is defective. You’ll have to replace the screen with a new one.
 
 
the screen has to be replaced if the IC was broken. Do not squeeze the IC to avoid damaging it.
 
Lastly, be sure to use an extension flex to test the screen before reassembly to prevent unnecessarily folding of the flex ribbons, as well as to prevent damage to the fragile connectors.

If all else fails try to get apple to fix it under a warranty
Hope this helps!
