Title: Shocking Truth Revealed: Hi Fi Component System Causes Chaos in Home Stereo and Theater!

Subtitle: How High-Fidelity Audio Components Can Mess Up Your Listening Experience

Introduction:

Many audiophiles invest a considerable amount of money and time assembling their perfect home theater or stereo system. However, is it possible that these Hi-Fi components are causing more harm than good? A recent study suggests that Hi-Fi components may be causing chaos in home stereo and theater systems. In this article, we'll explore the shocking truth and the implications of this revelation.

Body:

The study conducted by the Acoustical Society of America found that Hi-Fi components were causing interference and distortion in audio signals beyond what was previously believed. Researchers from the University of California did tests on a wide range of audio equipment that included amplifiers, CD players, and speakers. They discovered that even the best Hi-Fi components are capable of introducing distortion in audio signals that reduce the quality of the sound.

The problem arises from electrical interference, which occurs when different components interfere with each other's electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic noise and signals are like a chain reaction. One component introduced some noise; another picks it up and adds some more until it becomes a cascade of noise. And the closer the components are to each other, the larger the interference.

What's even more alarming is that some Hi-Fi components are causing interference not just in themselves but to other electronic devices as well such as your Wi-Fi router and cable box. Some audiophiles complain about their audio system interfering with their Wi-Fi signal, perversely causing more audio problems elsewhere in the house.

The main issue is that the audio components run on direct current (DC) power, and they require a power transformer to convert the alternating current (AC) power from the wall. These transformers often induce electrical noise, which results in distortion in the audio signal.

Solution:

Fortunately, some solutions can minimize the interference and distortion that Hi-Fi components create. Firstly, you can look for components with better shielding and better insulation. Secondly, you can rearrange your components and move your Hi-Fi components further away from other electronic devices. Thirdly, you can use power filters, surge suppressors, or UPSes that filter out unwanted interference that comes from the AC power. In general, use as few power handles as possible to reduce noise from delivering power. Lastly, High-quality cables are less prone to interference, so choose cables that have good shielding or are braided.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the study on Hi-Fi components and the recent revelation that they cause interference and chaos in home theater and stereo systems should not put you off buying Hi-Fi equipment. Instead, it is a warning to audiophiles that they must take extra care to minimize the problems caused by Hi-Fi components. You can take simple steps to ensure optimum sound output, such as keeping your equipment away from interference or use high-quality cables. It is essential to maintain a manageable and well laid out Hi-Fi set up for an even better listening experience.

That said, the next time you wonder why your home theater system or stereo doesn't sound right, think about how all the components contribute to both the good and bad sounds. The devil is in the detail, and you need to be mindful of it.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Sony HCD-RXD5 Stereo. Every time I turn it on, it makes a buzzing  sound, and I see ,’’Push Power, Protect’’ on the display. This has been happening for a week now. What could be the cause, and how could this issue be resolved?

 Vaughn Gracey   directly from Sony :” If the words PROTECT / PROTECTOR and PUSH POWER appear in alternating sequence on the display of your home audio device, or if the words PROTECT or PROTECTOR appear, there may be an external speaker issue or connection issue that is triggering the protection circuit. Try following these steps to resolve this issue:
NOTE: Because each of these steps represents a possible solution to this issue, check the A/V receiver status after completing each step.
If there has been an electrical surge or power outage, then the internal surge protection inside the home audio device may have been triggered to protect the device from the surge. This is normal. To reset the internal surge protection circuit unplug the AC power cord from the wall for at least 30 minutes.
 
Ensure the top of the home audio device has proper ventilation to keep it from overheating. Running the home audio device in a poorly ventilated cabinet can trigger the protection circuit.
 
Reduce the volume level. If the impedance of any of the speakers is below the rated impedance range indicated on the rear of the home audio device next to the speaker connections, the home audio device may enter the PROTECT mode. Raising the volume with a low impedance speaker will trigger the protection circuit.NOTES:Replace low impedance (outside of specifications) speakers with the correct impedance to prevent this from occurring.If you continue to use the low impedance (outside of specifications) speakers and you ran the Auto Calibration, check your SPEAKER SETUP and individual speaker LEVEL to reduce any speaker LEVEL with a positive gain to 0.0dB or less.
 
To isolate the problem, do the following:Turn off the home audio device, and remove all speaker wires from the back. Then turn the device back on and check if the issue is resolved. If it is still having the same issue, turn off the device again and let it rest for at least 30 minutes before turning it on again.Inspect the speaker cords. If a cord is frayed or in contact with another terminal, an error will occur. Fix the connection to prevent a short circuit.Make sure the speaker impedance is within the recommended range. If the impedance is not correct, sound will not come out properly and the speaker may be damaged. If speakers that are within the recommended impedance range, check the connections. If the speakers being used is within the suitable range and is still not working, there may be a malfunction or some other flaw within the speakers. Test by using a different set of speakers if available.”So, check your speakers first, including the wiring etc. Let us jknow what you find
