# Is your Motorola One 5G Ace missing an essential feature? Learn how to replace your Handset Ear Piece Speaker today!

The Motorola One 5G Ace is an affordable smartphone that promises a lot of features for the money. But despite its impressive specs and relatively low price tag, some users have reported that the handset earpiece speaker is not working properly. This can be a frustrating experience, especially if you rely on your phone for important calls and conversations.

Fortunately, if you are experiencing issues with your Motorola One 5G Ace's earpiece speaker, you don't need to buy a new phone. Instead, you can replace the speaker yourself. Here's how.

## Step 1: Turn off your phone

Before you begin disassembling your phone, it's important to turn it off completely. This will help prevent any damage to the device or its internal components.

## Step 2: Remove the back cover

The next step is to remove the back cover of your Motorola One 5G Ace. To do this, use a plastic opening tool or a thin plastic card to gently pry the cover off. Be careful not to damage the clips that secure the cover to the phone.

## Step 3: Remove the battery

Once you've removed the back cover, you'll need to remove the battery. To do this, use a plastic opening tool or a thin plastic card to gently pry up the battery from the adhesive that holds it in place.

## Step 4: Disconnect the earpiece speaker

With the battery out of the way, you can now disconnect the earpiece speaker. This is typically a small black or white rectangle-shaped component located near the top of the phone.

## Step 5: Install the new earpiece speaker

Once you've disconnected the old earpiece speaker, you can now install the new one. Simply connect the new speaker to the same connector where the old speaker was connected, making sure that it's securely in place.

## Step 6: Replace the battery and back cover

With the new earpiece speaker in place, you can now replace the battery and the back cover. Make sure that everything is securely in place and that the cover clips are all properly aligned.

## Step 7: Test the speaker

Once you've reassembled your phone, it's time to test the new earpiece speaker. Turn on your phone and make a call to ensure that the speaker is working properly.

If you continue to experience issues with the earpiece speaker on your Motorola One 5G Ace after replacing it, it's possible that there is a more complex hardware issue that requires the help of a professional. In these cases, it's best to contact Motorola's customer support for assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 I need a replacement handset ear piece speaker and it looks like there are 2 pieces for a motorola one 5g ace (xt2113)

 Hi @turtle62
Seems you're right.
It appears that there are two part numbers for the earpiece receiver for the XT2113 model, SR78C86690 and SR78C87845 and they both look the same.
Search online using the part number only to find suppliers that suit you best.
