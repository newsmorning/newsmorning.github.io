Title: You Won't Believe What's Happening with Your Macbook Pro Battery Readings!

Introduction:

If you are a Macbook Pro user, you may have noticed some unusual battery readings lately. Some users reported their laptops shutting down even when the battery indicator showed a significant charge. Others noticed their battery life decreasing much faster than before. These issues have caused a lot of frustration among users, and it turns out there is a reason behind it.

Body:

Apple recently released a statement acknowledging a battery issue in some 2016 and 2017 Macbook Pro models. The company said that the problem was related to the battery health management feature introduced in macOS Catalina 10.15.5. This feature was designed to improve battery lifespan by reducing the rate of chemical aging of the battery.

The feature achieved this by monitoring the battery temperature, charging history, and usage patterns to reduce the maximum charge level over time. This means that your Macbook Pro will charge to a lower level than the full capacity and adjust the charging rate to prolong the battery lifespan.

However, some users reported that the feature was causing issues with their battery readings. The battery indicator would show a higher charge level than the actual capacity, leading to unexpected shutdowns and reduced battery life. This could happen because the feature would reduce the maximum charge level to compensate for the battery's age and reduce the chance of hardware damage.

Apple has now released a fix for the issue in macOS Catalina 10.15.7. The update recalibrates the battery health management feature and improves the accuracy of the battery indicator. If you have a 2016 or 2017 Macbook Pro, you can install the update by going to System Preferences > Software Update.

Conclusion:

The battery health management feature is a useful addition to macOS, and it can improve the battery lifespan of your Macbook Pro. However, it's essential to understand how it works and the issues it can cause. If you have noticed any unusual battery readings, you should install the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 update to fix the problem. By doing so, you can ensure that your Macbook Pro provides you with reliable performance for many years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 let me give you little perspective. I just got my macbook pro second hand from eBay and the unit looks honestly clean and new I didn’t see a scratch. I checked all the ports and everything in the laptop. However, when I came to test the battery I found the charging information are weird. The current charging never goes to the full charging capacity even though the battery is at 100%. The full charging capacity changes every like 5 minutes or something when I close and reopen system report > power. That’s the only thing that concerns me.
Does anyone else have this issue? or it’s not even an issue that’s how it is?
Note: I tried the coconutBattery app and Battery Health 2. Both of them gave me the same readings as well.

 For starters, you may want to try a new battery just to be sure that the battery itself isn’t the problem.

I highly reccomend getting the fix kit for the battery because it comes with the adhesive remover for the battery which helps you safely remove the battery with less of a risk of puncturing or tearing the battery.
