Title: Acer Aspire A514 52 LCD Replacement WARNING: Shocking Results Will Leave You Speechless!

Have you noticed that your Acer Aspire A514 52 LCD screen has been damaged or is not functioning properly? You may be considering replacing it on your own, but beware - the results may be shocking!

Replacing an LCD screen is a delicate process that requires technical expertise and specialized tools. Even a small mistake can cause irreversible damage, electrical shock, or injury. That's why it's essential to follow proper procedures and precautions to avoid any mishaps.

Here are some things you need to know before attempting an Acer Aspire A514 52 LCD replacement:

1. Safety First

Before doing anything, ensure that you've turned off your laptop and unplugged it from the power source. Moreover, wear protective gear like gloves, glasses, and antistatic wristbands to avoid any shock, injury, or electrostatic discharge (ESD) that can damage the device's components.

2. Identify the Screen Model

To replace the LCD screen, you must identify the right model that fits your Acer Aspire A514 52. The wrong model may not fit or may cause compatibility issues, resulting in a malfunctioning device. You can check the model number of your original screen or refer to the laptop's manual for assistance.

3. Obtain the Appropriate Tools

To replace the screen, you'll need various tools like a screwdriver, plastic spudger or pry tool, and possibly a heat gun. Make sure that you have all the necessary tools, and that they are in good condition to perform the job.

4. Follow the Installation Steps Closely

Once you've identified the screen model and obtained the appropriate tools, it's time to replace the Acer Aspire A514 52 LCD. Follow the installation steps carefully, ensuring that every connection is tight and secure. Any loose connection may cause flickering or discoloured screen, or worse, no display at all.

5. Get Professional Assistance if You're Not Confident

If you're not confident in performing the screen replacement on your own or don't have the required technical expertise, seek professional assistance. A qualified technician can do the job faster and more efficiently, ensuring that your device functions correctly without any risks or damages.

In conclusion, replacing an Acer Aspire A514 52 LCD screen can be a daunting task that requires proper procedures and precautions. Following safety measures, identifying the right model, obtaining the right tools, and following the installation steps carefully can help you avoid any mishaps or damages. If you're not confident, seek professional assistance or risk shocking results that will leave you speechless!


## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the LCD on an Acer Aspire A514-52 and since replacement the device will not turn on.
I've tested the power jack with the multi-meter, and when plugged in it gets 19.41v, but the battery charging light does not light up.
I've unplugged the battery and charger and held the power button, I've tried booting direct from mains, nothing happens.
Could it be something I've done? I have replaced hundreds of these Acer LCD's and never had an issue like this.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

 Hi @oscart,
Is there any voltage appearing on the battery's red and black wire connection pins on the motherboard (with the battery removed) when you connect the charger?
I can't find a free download online so you may have to purchase the schematics to find out what's wrong.
Although I'm not certain that I linked the correct one as these are for an NB8513_MB_V3 motherboard and not for the model number you quoted. Nothing shows up when searching for an NB851_NB_V3 and the one I linked shows up a lot when searching for an "Aspire A514-52 motherboard schematic".
There are other results when searching for an NB8513_MB_V3 schematic or the laptop model number but mostly they're just for BIOS.bin files or boardview files and not the schematics.
Hopefully it is the one or it is close enough to help.
