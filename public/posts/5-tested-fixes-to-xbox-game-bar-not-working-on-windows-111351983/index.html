Microsoft, fortunately, has a few mitigating measures for this type of problem.➡ Xbox game bar is disabled from Registry – This behavior can be expected if a hard-coded Registry value has been set to disable this component. When you update to Windows 11, the enforcement (which is represented by a DWORD value) will be carried over as well.➡ IeFrame Dynamic Link Library is corrupted – This problem might occur as a result of a DLL requirement (ieframe.dll) that the Xbox game bar relies on while running on Windows 11.➡ Faulty Windows update – Another likely culprit responsible for this strange behavior with the Xbox game bar is a partially incompatible upgrade that ends up interfering with the broadcasting component of the console’s operating system.</p><h2 id=how-to-fix-xbox-game-bar-not-recording-on-windows-11>How to fix Xbox game bar not recording on Windows 11?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-fix-xbox-game-bar-not-recording-on-windows-11>#</a></h2><p>In addition to the steps below, you can also have a go and these handy solutions:</p><ul><li><p>Why is Xbox game bar not working on Windows 11?</p></li><li><p>How to fix Xbox game bar not recording on Windows 11?</p></li><li><ol><li>Enable the bar from Settings</li></ol></li><li><ol start=2><li>Reset the Xbox game bar component ✅</li></ol></li><li><ol start=3><li>Enable the feature in Registry Editor</li></ol></li><li><ol start=4><li>Repair the ieframe.dll file</li></ol></li><li><ol start=5><li>Enable Xbox game bar in Local Group Policy Editor</li></ol></li><li><p>Is Windows 11 good for gaming in 2022/2023?</p></li><li><p>Reinstall the Xbox Game Bar from the Microsoft Store</p></li><li><p>Try modifying the captures folder</p></li><li><p>Update or roll back Windows updates, according to your specific case</p></li></ul><h3 id=1-enable-the-bar-from-settings>1.
