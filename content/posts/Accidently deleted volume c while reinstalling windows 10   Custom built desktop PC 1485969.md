As a technology enthusiast, I decided to build my own desktop. It was a fun project, and I enjoyed the flexibility that came with choosing the components that would make up my system. However, things took a turn for the worse when I decided to reinstall Windows 10.

I had been experiencing some performance issues with my system, and I figured that a fresh install of Windows 10 would help address the problem. I had done this before on my laptop, and it had worked like a charm. However, I soon realized that the stakes were much higher with my custom-built desktop.

I backed up all my important files to an external hard drive and proceeded to reinstall Windows 10. I popped in the installation disk and booted up the system. The setup process began, and I was prompted to choose a partition to install Windows 10. This is where the trouble began.

Although I had backed up all my files, I had failed to back up the partition that contained the operating system. I assumed that the installation process would give me the option to format the partition and install the new operating system without deleting anything else. However, I was wrong.

In my haste, I selected the wrong partition and inadvertently deleted Volume C, which contained my old operating system, all my programs, and all my personal files. I realized this too late and was unable to undo the damage that I had done.

I was devastated. All the pictures and documents that I had collected over the years were gone, along with all of my installed programs. I had to start from scratch and reinstall everything, including the operating system. It was a painstaking process that took me an entire weekend to complete.

Looking back, I realize that my lack of preparation and haste had caused this disaster. I should have taken more time to back up all my data and verify that I was selecting the correct partition to install Windows 10. I also should have considered creating a recovery disk or using a data recovery tool to potentially recover the deleted data.

In conclusion, I learned a valuable lesson from this experience. Building your own desktop can be a rewarding experience, but it comes with its own set of challenges. It's important to take the necessary precautions when reinstalling the operating system or making any major changes to your system. Always make sure to back up your data, verify your actions, and consider the potential consequences before making any changes. Failure to do so can lead to a nightmare scenario like the one I experienced.

 Hello Dushyant!
The way I go about installing Windows is through USB. Putting Windows 10 on a Thumb Drive and installing after entering BIOS has worked for me several times! Plus it wipes your Hard Drive and frees up a ton of space as an added bonus.
Just search "Install Windows 10 USB" on Youtube, and you can find a wide array of tutorials. I recommend a Thumb Drive of 16GB or higher for this operation. If you need a computer to do this operation, I recommend using a friends computer, or even a Library computer.
Best of Luck! Hope I helped!
