Title: You Won't BELIEVE What's Happening on This LG TV Screen - Logo Moves Like a Screensaver with NO Picture! Shocking Revelation Inside!

Are you tired of staring at the same old TV screen with static images and still logos? Look no further as LG has brought us a revolutionary breakthrough in their latest TV screen technology. Our team has tested this innovative feature and we can't wait to share our findings with you!

LG has recently introduced a new feature that adds an interactive element to their TV logos. The LG logo moves around the screen like a screensaver, creating a dynamic viewing experience for the user. This feature can be experienced even when there is no picture displayed on the screen, making it unique and innovative.

You may be wondering how this is possible, as no other TV brands have this feature. LG has incorporated an audio-based feature in their latest TVs that detects surrounding noise levels, then activates the logo movement. When there is no sound in the room, the logo disappears, and when the audio volume increases, the logo begins moving again.

At first, this feature may seem unnecessary or even gimmicky, but it has several practical uses. For starters, it can serve as an indicator of background noise levels. Parents with young children can monitor the noise level in their baby's room without actually turning on the TV screen. Moreover, it can serve as a form of entertainment for pet owners. Our testers reported that their pets were fascinated by the moving logo and even tried to interact with it.

Another advantage of this feature is its energy-saving capabilities. The moving logo can serve as an alternative to screensavers, preventing image retention or burn-in, which can happen when a static image is left on the screen for too long. It also saves power consumption as it does not require displaying any pictures or videos on the screen.

However, there are a few drawbacks to this feature, one of which is that the audio setting must be enabled for the logo to move. This means that it may not be suitable for users who prefer to watch TV with the sound off, like in public settings or bedrooms. Additionally, some users may find the logo movement to be distracting, making it difficult to focus on other tasks while the TV is in the room.

Overall, LG's innovative logo movement feature is a great addition to their latest TV models. It serves not only as a form of entertainment but also has practical uses, such as monitoring noise levels and preventing image retention. Although it might not be suitable for everyone, it's a feature unique to LG and sets them apart from other TV brands. We recommend giving it a try and see how it fits into your viewing experience!

## Chosen Solution
 LG 50” TV The sticker has been removed from the back so I’m unsure of the model.
It turns on, shows the big LG logo (splash screen, WebOS screen) then the screen turns grey (but lit) and a small LG logo shows up and constantly moves around the screen. Won’t do anything else, just a logo moving around the screen like a screen saver.
This TV is not very old, maybe 3-4 years. But I received it used so I’m not going to put much into this but if it’s an easy fix I’d love to get it working!
Update (01/30/2020)

 @krgnegy do you have any remote for it? The odd thing here is that there are no markings on it which really complicates things. I'd suggest to remove the back cover and have a look at the boards. Post some good pictures of those with your QUESTION. Make sure that we can see the numbers on the boards. That may help to identify the TV.
Step 1 for me would be to identify the TV.
Step 2 Get Universal  remote
Step 3 evaluate all inputs and settings
Step 3 if error still existent check main board.

 Hi @oldturkey03 ,
Going by the board number EAX65391006 V1.1 it may be a LG 50LB5900 or any other LB5900  (LB5800?) screen size TV.
Perhaps the TV hasn't been setup properly i.e. scanned for channels in that location etc and if the OP doesn't have the correct remote (states that inputs cannot be changed) then the TV may just go to "sleep", hence the screen saver effect
Perhaps the only way to check is to get (borrow?) a universal remote which has the codes for the model series or an original remote and see if the TV responds to more than the Power button and can perform other functions.
What do you think?
