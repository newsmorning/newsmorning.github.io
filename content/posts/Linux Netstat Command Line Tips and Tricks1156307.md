Title: Linux Gurus Reveal Secret Netstat Command Line Tricks You Never Knew Existed!

As a Linux user, it's essential to have a solid understanding of the command line interface. And one of the most commonly used network diagnostic tools for Linux users is the netstat command.

Netstat (Network Statistics) is a command-line utility that provides information about inbound and outbound network connections, network interfaces, and network protocols. It is a powerful tool that can help you troubleshoot and debug network connectivity problems quickly.

In this article, we'll explore some of the netstat command-line tricks that you might not have known existed, which can help you take your network troubleshooting skills to the next level.

1. Display Network Connections in Real-time

By default, netstat displays the current network connections on your system. However, you can use the -c or --continuous option to display the network connections in real-time. This can help you monitor network connections in real-time and identify any network connectivity issues.

To display network connections in real-time, run the following command:

     netstat -c

2. Display Information in a Custom Format

Netstat provides several default output formats, which may not always provide the information you need. However, you can use the -o or --out option to display information in a custom format.

For example, to display the IP addresses and port numbers in a custom format, run the following command:

     netstat -a -n -o | awk '{print $4"\t"$5}'

This will display the IP addresses and port numbers in a tab-separated format.

3. Display Network Interfaces and IP Addresses

In addition to displaying network connections, netstat can also display information about network interfaces and IP addresses. You can use the -i or --interfaces option to display information about network interfaces.

To display information about network interfaces, run the following command:

     netstat -i

4. Display Listening Ports

If you want to identify which ports are open and listening on your system, netstat can help. You can use the -l or --listening option to display listening ports.

To display listening ports, run the following command:

     netstat -l

5. Display Network Statistics

Netstat can also provide network statistics such as network packets and errors. You can use the -s or --statistics option to display network statistics.

To display network statistics, run the following command:

     netstat -s

Conclusion

Netstat is a vital command-line tool for Linux users, and these tricks can help you make the most out of it. By using these tricks, you can quickly diagnose and resolve network connectivity problems, monitor network connections in real-time, and get more information about your system's network interface and statistics.

So, there you have it - some of the best netstat command-line tricks that you never knew existed. Mastering these tricks can help you become a Linux networking pro and make troubleshooting network issues a breeze.

Netstat is a command line utility that can be used to monitor both incoming and outgoing network connections as well as view routing tables, interface statistics, etc. It can be used to list all the connected TCP and UDP socket connections and also list listening sockets that are waiting for incoming connections.
 
Netstat is available on all Unix-like operating systems. It is very useful for every system administrator to monitor and troubleshoot network-related problems and determine network traffic performance.
 
In this tutorial we will discuss how to use netstat to find information about network connections and open ports on a Linux system.
 
## List all the TCP and UDP connections
 
The simplest way to use netstat is to list all the TCP and UDP connections.
 
Simply run the netstat command with the -a option.
 
You should see the following output.
 

 
The above command shows all the established and listening TCP and UDP socket connections
 
## List only TCP or UDP connections
 
You can only list TCP connections using the -t option.
 
Similarly, only list UDP connections using the u option.
 
## List all listening connections
 
You can list all active listening ports connections using the -l option.
 
## Disable reverse DNS lookup for faster output
 
By default, the netstat command tries to find the hostname of each IP address in the connection by doing a reverse DNS lookup. This slows down the output.
 
You can disable reverse DNS lookup with the -n option.
 
## List the process name and user ID
 
When viewing the open listening ports and connections, it’s necessary to know the process name which has opened that port or connection.
 
You can get process details using the -p option.
 
You can get the username along with process name using the e option.
 
## List network statistics
 
The netstat command can also be used to print network statistics of the total number of packets received and transmitted by protocol type.
 
To list statistics of all packet types, run:
 
## Displaying IPv4 and IPv6 information
 
You can use the -g option to display the multicast information for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.
 
## Display network interface statistics
 
You can also print the information of your network interface. You can do this with the -i and -e options:
 
## Conclusion
 
In above post we have explained most of what netstat is used for. If you are looking for more advanced information, read the netstat manual. You can also leave your feedback and suggestions in the comments box below.
