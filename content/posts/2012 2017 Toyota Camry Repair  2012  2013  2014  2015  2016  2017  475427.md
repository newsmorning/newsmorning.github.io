# Is Your Toyota Camry Falling Apart? Discover the Ultimate Repair Guide for 2012-2017 Models!

If you own a Toyota Camry from 2012 to 2017, you may have noticed issues with its performance over time. As with any vehicle, regular wear and tear is inevitable, but this doesn't mean you need to start searching for a new car. With the right knowledge and tools, you can repair your Toyota Camry and have it running like new in no time. Let's take a look at some of the most common issues that occur in Toyota Camrys and how you can fix them.

## Check Engine Light

The check engine light is one of the most dreaded warning lights that you can see on your dashboard. When it comes on, you know that something isn't right with your vehicle. In most cases, the check engine light is caused by a malfunctioning sensor or a problem with one of the system components. It's important to address this issue as soon as possible to prevent further damage to your car.

To fix this issue, you'll need to diagnose the problem. The first step is to use an OBD-II scanner to retrieve the code that triggered the check engine light. Once you have the code, you can look it up online or in a repair manual to determine the cause. In some cases, it may be as simple as replacing a faulty sensor, while in others, you may need to replace an entire component.

## Transmission Problems

Transmission issues are common in Toyota Camrys, especially those with automatic transmissions. Symptoms of transmission problems include slipping gears, delayed shifting, and rough shifting. These problems can be caused by a number of factors, including low transmission fluid, a faulty solenoid, or worn-out clutches.

To fix these issues, you'll need to start by checking the transmission fluid level. If it's low, you'll need to add more fluid. If the fluid is dark or has a burnt smell, you may need to replace it. In some cases, the problem may be with the solenoid, which controls the transmission fluid flow. If you suspect that the solenoid is faulty, you'll need to replace it.

## Suspension Issues

Suspension issues are another common problem in Toyota Camrys. Symptoms of suspension problems include noises when driving over bumps, uneven tire wear, and a bouncy ride. These issues can be caused by worn-out shocks or struts, damaged springs, or worn-out bushings.

To fix suspension issues, you'll need to diagnose the problem. This may involve visual inspections, test drives, or even taking the car to a mechanic. Once you've determined the cause, you can replace the faulty component. This may involve replacing shocks or struts, springs, or bushings.

## Conclusion

If you're experiencing issues with your Toyota Camry from 2012 to 2017, don't panic. These problems are common and can be fixed with a little knowledge and some basic tools. Whether you're dealing with transmission problems, suspension issues, or a check engine light, following the steps outlined in this guide can help you get your Camry back up and running smoothly. With the right approach, your Camry can be as good as new!
