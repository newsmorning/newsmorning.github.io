## Chosen Solution
 Lighting struck near by and our TV went out I don’t know if it’s one board or both boards.

 eds95hog all of this "the fuse was blown I replaced it but it was to big and it blew that fuse and also took out I think a thremrister also NT811s" would lead me to purchase a new power board. Schematics for your PSU are not available, so to determine what has potentially failed is going to be tough. The failing fuse etc. is not related to a bad power board. that is not to say that this is the only thing that has failed. It is fairly common for the main board to get "zapped" but that would not cause the damage on the power board. It is of course entirely possible that both boards got damaged. I'd start with the power board and then re-evaluate. If there are still issues I would replace the main board.
