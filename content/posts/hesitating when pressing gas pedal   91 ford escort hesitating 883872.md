It can be a frustrating experience when your 91 Ford Escort hesitates when you step on the gas pedal. You may wonder what is going wrong with your car and how to fix it. The good news is that there is a common reason why this happens, and there are a few steps that you can take to resolve the issue.

The probable cause of the hesitation is a clogged fuel or air filter. These filters are essential components of your car's engine system that help maintain proper fuel and air flow. Over time, filters get clogged with dirt and debris, hampering the engine's performance, and causing hesitation when accelerating. 

If your Ford Escort is showing signs of hesitation or sluggishness, the first thing you need to check is the air filter. Air filters are typically located under the hood, either in a large plastic housing, or a metal casing. To check the air filter, remove the housing and visually inspect the filter. If it's dirty or clogged, replace it with a new one.

Next, check the fuel filter. The fuel filter is normally located along the fuel line, close to the fuel tank, or under the hood. If your car has been struggling with accelerations or idling performance, it's a good idea to check the fuel filter for any blockages. Replace it promptly if it's dirty or clogged.

If the air and fuel filters are clean or replaced, move on to the next potential cause of the throttle hesitation. A failing fuel pump, a faulty idle air control valve, and vacuum leaks can also cause hesitation when accelerating. If you're not comfortable diagnosing these issues, you can consult a certified Ford mechanic to help you solve the problem.

In conclusion, your 91 Ford Escort may be hesitating when you step on the gas pedal due to a clogged air or fuel filter. You can easily fix it by cleaning or replacing the clogged filter. If this doesn't solve the problem, it may be a symptom of a faulty component in your engine system. Remember, preventive maintenance is key to keeping your car running smoothly. 

By taking good care of your fuel and air filters, and regularly checking other components of your car's engine system, you can avoid most common automotive issues, such as throttle hesitation, and extend your vehicle's lifespan.

## Chosen Solution
 hesitating while pressing gas pedal, and also in cruise control if you set it at 65 it will go down to 55-58 then a minute later it picks up to 65-72 while set at 65. I was thinking possible the fuel filter

 First, check your air filter.  Easy to check, cheap to replace.  The darker it is, the dirtier it is, unless you are using a aftermarket specialty filter like K & N or AiRaid.  Replace if dirty.
Second, use a fuel system cleaner such as Lucas Oil Fuel System Cleaner or Startron.  I have used both and both work.  Use as directed for 3 consecutive tanks of gas.  After that, use once every 3 to 5 tanks to maintain a clean fuel system.  Lucas price varies by size of the bottle, Startron is about $9 per bottle.  Both will treat multiple tanks of gas.
After those two items, things get harder and more expensive.
Third, check your spark plugs.  Unless you are mechanically inclined, you need a mechanically inclined person to do this.  If they are dirty, burned or damaged they must be cleaned or replaced.  If they are not dirty, burned or damaged, the gap should be checked and they should be re-gapped if necessary.  If your vehicle has spark plug wires, check them at this time.  If old and brittle or cracked, replace them.
Other things that could/should be checked:  Fuel Filter, Mass Air/Mass Air Flow Sensor, Oxygen Sensor,
Best wishes on a cheap repair.  :-)
