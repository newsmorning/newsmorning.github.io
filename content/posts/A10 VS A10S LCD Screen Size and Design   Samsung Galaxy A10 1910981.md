Samsung Galaxy A10 Vs A10S: Which One Has the Bigger, Bolder & More Beautiful Screen Design?

The Samsung Galaxy A10 and A10S are two popular smartphones from Samsung. They are both budget devices that offer a lot of features at an affordable price. However, one important aspect that users consider before purchasing a smartphone is its screen display. In this article, we'll compare the screen design of both the Samsung Galaxy A10 and A10S to determine which one has the bigger, bolder & more beautiful display.

Screen Size

Firstly, let's discuss the screen size of both smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy A10 has a 6.2-inch display, while the A10S comes with a larger 6.2-inch display. So, it's pretty clear that the A10S has a bigger screen as compared to its predecessor. The bigger display of the A10S is more enjoyable for users who love to stream movies or watch videos.

Screen Quality

The Samsung Galaxy A10 and A10S have the same display resolution of 720 x 1520 pixels. However, the A10S comes with an IPS LCD technology screen, while the Galaxy A10 has a TFT display. This means that the A10S's screen has better viewing angles, better color reproduction, and better brightness levels. As a result, the A10S has a more beautiful screen design as compared to the A10.

Screen Protection

Samsung's Galaxy A10 and A10S both come with a Gorilla Glass screen protector. However, the A10S has a more advanced Gorilla Glass 3 protection while the A10 comes with the previous Gorilla Glass 2 protection. The Gorilla Glass 3 uses a chemical strengthening process that makes it less prone to breaking and scratches. So, the A10S's screen is more protected from accidental drops, scratches, and cracks.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy A10S has a bigger, bolder, and more beautiful screen design as compared to the A10. It has a larger display, better technology, and more advanced protection. Therefore, if you're looking for a budget smartphone that has a great screen display, the A10S is the better choice. However, if you're not a big fan of larger phones and don't care much about the quality of your screen display, the A10 is still a great option.

## Chosen Solution
 Is Samsung Galaxy A10 LCD screen is the same as Samsung Galaxy A10s…Is there any difference between their sizes and design?Cause i’m planning to buy samsung a10s lcd screen…the only tutorial i saw here is for A10…just wanna ask before i buy a lcd screen…

 As far as I can tell, the screens aren’t interchangeable. But I would imagine the steps to perform the repair would be similar between the models.

 From what I know, yes, there is no difference at all, same size and resolution
