Are you tired of rough shifting in your car? Does it feel like you're being jostled around every time you change gears? If so, it's time to master the art of setting the 700R4 TV cable for smoother shifting.

The TV cable, or throttle valve cable, is a critical component of your car's transmission system. It connects the throttle body to the transmission and tells it when to shift gears. If the cable is not set correctly, the transmission will not shift smoothly, and it could even damage the transmission over time.

So, how do you set the TV cable correctly? Here's a step-by-step guide to help you rev up your ride:

Step 1: Make sure your car is on a level surface and the engine is off.

Step 2: Locate the TV cable on your car's transmission. It will be connected to the throttle body and run down to the transmission.

Step 3: Loosen the cable adjustment bolt on the transmission. This will allow you to adjust the cable's tension.

Step 4: Move the throttle body to the wide-open position by pressing on the gas pedal or using a wrench on the throttle cable.

Step 5: Pull the TV cable all the way out and release it. This will set the cable to its maximum tension.

Step 6: Push the TV cable in slightly until there is about 1/16th of an inch of slack in the cable.

Step 7: Tighten the cable adjustment bolt on the transmission.

Step 8: Start the engine and let it run at idle for a few minutes.

Step 9: Take your car for a test drive and pay attention to how it shifts. If the shifts are smoother and more consistent, you've successfully set the TV cable.

It's important to note that if the TV cable is not set correctly, it can cause serious damage to your car's transmission. If you're not comfortable setting the cable yourself, it's always best to take your car to a professional mechanic who can do it for you.

In conclusion, mastering the art of setting the 700R4 TV cable can make a huge difference in the way your car shifts gears. By following these simple steps, you can enjoy a smoother ride and avoid costly transmission repairs down the road. Buckle up and get ready to rev up your ride!

## Chosen Solution
 I have a 1972 Corvette that I put a 700r4 transmission in and have a question.  I have been trying to adjust the tv cable as everyone has told me to Push down on the release tab and push the center tab in on the end of the cable, then go to full throttle and it should then set the cable to the correct setting meaning the center tab should click into place.  Mine is free and moves easy, its a new cable and its being put on an Edelbrock duel guad carb setup. However it doesn't click out at all, no movement.  Does that mean that it's set and doesn't need anything further?  Or does it mean that the throttle lever and tv cable end aren't traveling far enough?  I have went so far as to pulling on the cable end to see if it will click out and it does.

 Fixed it today by taking the transmission pan off and setting it visually in the transmission.

 what does that look like?
