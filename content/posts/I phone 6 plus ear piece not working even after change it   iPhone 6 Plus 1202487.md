# You Won't Believe Why Your iPhone 6 Plus Ear Piece Isn't Working - Even After Replacing It!

Are you having trouble with the earpiece on your iPhone 6 Plus? Have you already invested in a replacement earpiece, only to find that it still doesn't work? Don't worry, you're not alone! This is a common problem and it has nothing to do with the earpiece at all.

The root of the issue lies within the iPhone's audio IC chip. The audio IC chip is responsible for controlling all audio functions on your iPhone, including the earpiece speaker. Over time, this chip can become worn out or damaged, causing audio-related issues like a malfunctioning earpiece.

This problem is more prevalent in the iPhone 6 Plus due to the size and weight of the phone. The added stress and strain on the device can cause the audio IC chip to fail sooner than in smaller iPhone models.

So, what's the solution to this problem? Unfortunately, there is no quick fix. The audio IC chip requires microsoldering, a specialized repair technique that involves precise soldering under a microscope. It's a complex and delicate process that can only be done by experienced professionals.

There are several repair shops that offer microsoldering services, but it's important to choose a reputable provider. Look for a shop with experienced technicians, good reviews, and a warranty on their work.

It's also worth noting that this issue is not covered by Apple's warranty. If you take your iPhone to an Apple store, they will likely recommend a full device replacement, which can be costly.

In summary, if your iPhone 6 Plus earpiece isn't working even after replacing it, it's likely due to a problem with the audio IC chip. This requires microsoldering to fix, so be sure to choose a reputable repair shop. Don't waste your money on unnecessary earpiece replacements â€“ fix the root of the problem instead.
