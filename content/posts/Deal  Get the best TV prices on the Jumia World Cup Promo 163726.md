## How to choose the right TV on Jumia World Cup
 
You do not need to be an expert or even technical when looking out for a buy to make. There are just about five factors to consider:
 
### Screen Size
 
The bigger the screen, the bigger the experience, and the bigger the price. If too large your TV can take up too much space, thereby making your living room look smaller than it is. That’s why it’s advisable to opt for something large but wise, affordable and capable of creating your off-screen experience.  The large screens begin from 32 inches and can go anywhere up to 85 inches. 
 
### Resolution 
 
For better contrast and a clearer picture, your resolution should preferably be High Dynamic. A better resolution should be considered when purchasing a TV. 
 
### Sound
 
You can’t afford to miss out on that immersive experience of being a part of the show if you do not upgrade your sound by upgrading your TV. The sound must be clear and that’s why it’s advisable to purchase an affordable TV with a Dolby Digital Technology enhanced sound. Anything less would be agony to listen to when watching the Football Competition. 
 
### Cost 
 
A television is practically a furniture in the home. Just as some furniture are more expensive than others, similarly, some Televisions are more expensive than others. This is why it’s advisable to consider your budget first when looking to purchase a TV set. Also, consider the cost of the TV, as well as its features. If it’s too high and would render you bankrupt then you can do without.  
 
### Display
 
A rich display is determined by the colour reproduction and clarity of the image. This adds to the feeling of immersion when viewing images on your TV, and gives you a Live experience.
 
## The Deals:
 
Here are five affordable TVs that meet every requirement mentioned. They are sorted out of a list including manufacturers like LG, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic, HiSense, and Star Times.
