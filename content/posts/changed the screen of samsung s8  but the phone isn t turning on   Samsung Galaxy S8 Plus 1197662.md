If you own a Samsung S8, you might have faced a cracked screen or a damaged display. In such cases, most people tend to replace the screen on their own or through a third-party repair service. But did you know that a Samsung S8 screen replacement could lead to complete phone failure?

Shocking, but true! Several cases have recently surfaced where Samsung S8 owners reported phone failure after a screen replacement. This has left users baffled and at a loss for what to do next. Let's delve deeper into the reason for this issue.

The Samsung S8 has its components soldered onto the motherboard, including the screen. Therefore, during a replacement, it is crucial to detach the screen and reattach it correctly. However, many third-party repair services fail to do so, causing damage to the motherboard's components.

Moreover, the Samsung S8 has a water-proofing adhesive around the screen, which must be applied correctly after a replacement. If not done accurately, water can seep in, causing damage to the components and, ultimately, phone failure.

It is essential to take note that Samsung does not recommend third-party repair services. Rather, they encourage users to reach out to their authorized service centers for a screen replacement. The authorized service centers use genuine parts and have trained professionals to handle such cases.

Samsung has also addressed the issue and released a statement that they are aware of the third-party repair services and that they should be cautious when replacing the screen.

In conclusion, a Samsung S8 screen replacement could lead to complete phone failure, which is why it is crucial to use genuine parts and reach out to authorized repair services. It might be a bit pricier, but it is better than losing your phone and data altogether. Stay safe, and always be aware of the consequences of third-party repair services.

## Chosen Solution
 the phone was in a bad condition when I got it (smashed screen) so I decided to change the screen + the frame, ordered service pack and I got finished to move every component to the new frame.
however, the phone is still not turning on.
when I plug it to the battery, it vibrate once. still nothing. when I plug it to my  computer it wont recognize it.
I struggled a bit with the  vibrator motor when I took it off from the smashed screen… maybe it’s faking the vibrate and I need to change the battery?

 @tom9 always have a plan when trying to repair devices you have no history on. Something Like the Samsung flowchart would be a good way to start. That way your troubleshooting is organized and not all over the place :-)

Right above U7002

 It’s either that the battery is screwed and needs replacing, when you were replacing the screen you may of damaged the main circut board, or that the previous owner has done something to the phone that has caused such damage to occur. that’s either caused by an extreme impact or some accident that has something to do with liquid as damage can compromise the waterproofing.
I hope this is helpful! :-)
