Have you ever experienced changing your iPhone 3Gs LCD only to find out that the backlight is not working? Well, believe it or not, it happened to me. Here's what I did to fix it.

First, I checked the ribbon cable that connects the LCD to the logic board. It was properly aligned, so that's not the problem. Then, I tried to turn off the "Auto-Brightness" feature in the "Display and Brightness" settings since this could also be the culprit. Unfortunately, it didn't work.

Next, I did a hard reset by simultaneously holding down the home button and power button until the Apple logo appears. Still, no backlight. So, I decided to use a flashlight to shine the screen, and to my surprise, I can see the faint outlines of the icons and text on the display. This means that the LCD is working correctly, but the backlight is not.

After searching online for possible solutions, I stumbled upon a post that suggested cleaning the connectors between the LCD and the backlight. So, I turned off my iPhone again and took off the LCD. I then used a microfiber cloth to clean the connectors gently, making sure to remove any dirt or debris that may have built up over time.

To my relief, when I reattached the LCD, the backlight came back to life! I could see everything clearly and without the need for a flashlight. I tested it by adjusting the brightness level, and it behaves normally.

In conclusion, changing your iPhone 3Gs LCD is easy, but be cautious when reattaching the connectors. A little dirt or poor alignment can cause problems with the backlight, and you'll end up with an unlit display. But, don't fret; try cleaning the connectors and see if it works. Who knows? It might be the solution you're looking for.

## Chosen Solution
 I just ordered a new LCD, installed it, and still no backlight. Im tempted to replace my 6r8 coil, but theres no visible damage done to it (i was told that there would be corrosion or something). Can anybody help please? I have no clue what to do next.

 there are mostly two things which is dealing backlight of the lcd. one is the coil (6r8) other is the lcd itself . if you have changed the lcd then must be the coil . check the coil is damage or not ? send us the clear picture of the logic board removing shields . sometime the lcd is bad . under the flex of the lcd there is 2 prints which is soldered on the flex of the lcd that is of backlight of the lcd . check both are okay with the jack on the flex . check with the multimeter..
