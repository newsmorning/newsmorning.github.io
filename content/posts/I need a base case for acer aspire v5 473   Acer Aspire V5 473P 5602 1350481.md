Title: You Won't Believe the Crucial Piece Your Acer Aspire V5 473 and 473P 5602 is Missing! Find Out Now.

Subtitle: Don't let your Acer Aspire V5 473 and 473P 5602 lag behind due to the missing piece!

Are you tired of your Acer Aspire V5 473 and 473P 5602 running slowly, freezing or crashing when you need to work or play? Then, you should know that the problem might not be the laptop's performance or the type of tasks that you are running. Instead, it might all boil down to one crucial piece that is missing from your laptop - a Solid State Drive (SSD).

Most laptop users tend to overlook the importance of SSDs when it comes to enhancing the speed and performance of their laptops. That's because most laptops come equipped with a conventional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) as the primary storage component. However, HDDs are not optimized for speed, durability or power efficiency, which means that they can easily compromise your laptop's performance and slow it down with time.

This is where SSDs come in to save the day. Unlike HDDs, SSDs are made of a collection of memory chips that store data without any moving parts. This makes them faster, more durable and power-efficient than their HDD counterparts. With an SSD installed, your Acer Aspire V5 473 and 473P 5602 can boot up in seconds, run your apps smoothly without lagging and open files swiftly without any delays.

Additionally, SSDs come in different storage capacities, ranging from 128GB to 2TB or more. Having a large capacity SSD can significantly increase your laptop's storage space, allowing you to store more files, photos, and videos without having to worry about running out of space.

Installing an SSD on your Acer Aspire V5 473 and 473P 5602 is relatively easy and straightforward. However, if you are not familiar with laptop hardware installation, it's advisable to seek the help of a professional or someone with experience in laptop upgrades.

In conclusion, if you want to upgrade your Acer Aspire V5 473 and 473P 5602, you should consider installing an SSD. Not only will this upgrade save you time and money in the long run, but it will also improve your laptop's usability and overall performance. Don't let your Acer Aspire V5 473 and 473P 5602 lag behind due to the missing piece. Decide to install an SSD today and enjoy the thrill of a faster, more efficient laptop experience.

## Chosen Solution
 Where can I purchase a case base for this model?

 Hi @jsmalls24 ,
Do you have the old base case still?
There are a lot of base cases available for a V5 471 and V5 472 models which appear to use the same case, going by the part number.
If you have the old case still, check if there is a part number on it somewhere and then search online using the part number rather than the laptop model number.
It may be that it is the same case that is used for a different model but it is not listed for your model by the seller.
Just a thought.
