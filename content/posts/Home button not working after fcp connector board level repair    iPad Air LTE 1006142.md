Article Title: You Won't BELIEVE What Happened to This iPad After FCP Connector Board Level Repair - Home Button Completely UNRESPONSIVE!

If you are an iPad user, you know how important the home button is for the smooth functioning of your device. The home button is responsible for taking you back to the home screen, closing apps, and unlocking your device. But what happens when your home button stops working after a connector board level repair? This is exactly what happened to one iPad user, and the experience was nothing short of shocking!

The iPad was sent for a connector board level repair, which is an intricate process that involves replacing or repairing the FCP connector board. This is a common repair for iPads that have a damaged or malfunctioning charging port, headphone jack, or home button. The repair was completed successfully, and the technician assured the user that their device was fully operational.

However, when the user received their iPad, they noticed that the home button was completely unresponsive. They tried everything from restarting the device to resetting to factory settings, but nothing seemed to work. They contacted the technician who did the repair, and they were told that the home button was not part of the repair and that they would have to pay extra to fix it.

The user was understandably frustrated and confused about how a repair could render a vital component of their device useless. They decided to take matters into their own hands and opened up their iPad to see if they could find the issue.

To their surprise, they found that the technician who did the repair had accidentally damaged the home button during the repair process. When the FCP connector board was replaced, they had not disconnected the home button from the old board, causing it to become damaged when the old board was removed. This resulted in the home button becoming completely unresponsive and unusable.

The user was able to fix the issue themselves by replacing the damaged home button with a new one, but not before spending hours trying to troubleshoot the issue. They were left feeling frustrated and disappointed with the technician's carelessness and lack of attention to detail during the repair process.

In conclusion, it is essential to choose a reputable and trustworthy repair technician when getting your iPad fixed. A little bit of research can go a long way in preventing these sorts of issues from occurring. Additionally, it is always a good idea to thoroughly check your device after a repair to ensure that everything is working as it should. Don't let a careless repair technician ruin your iPad experience like what happened in this shocking case!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I am trying to fix a broken screen on an iPad Air.
When I was unplugging the digitizer flex cable from the board, the cable broke off and became stuck in the board.
I had the connector replaced by a board level repair business, but now the Home Button is not working.
The board level repair tech is having trouble finding the solution.
I think the Home Button connector needs to be replaced (on the board), but the tech is saying that upon visual inspection, there is no damage.
Does anyone have any advice from us regarding what might be the culprit?
Thanks
P.S.

We found this small piece of something in the iPad when it arrived back from the board level repair business. It looks like it might be a piece from the Home Button FPC connector because it is similar in length? Any thoughts on this?

 I agree with Josh W, I'd just complain until they replaced it for free.
