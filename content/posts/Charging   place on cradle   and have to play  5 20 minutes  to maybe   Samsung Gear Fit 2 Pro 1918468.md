Revolutionary Charging Hack for Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro: Play Just 5-20 Minutes and Get Hours of Battery Life!

If you are a Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro owner, then you know the trouble that comes with keeping your device's battery life. The Gear Fit 2 Pro came out in 2017, but for a 2-year-old device, the battery's lifespan can become woefully inadequate, within just a few months. Itâ€™s not always easy to keep it charged up all the time, especially when it seems that its charging capacity is much slower than that of its brand new competitors. But what if we told you that there is a revolutionary charging hack for Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro that can help you stretch out its battery life for hours? 

Well, this is not just a theoretical concept. Through live, persistent testing, Samsung Galaxy users worldwide have discovered the "Revolutionary charging hack" that can help you get hours of battery life from just five to twenty minutes of playtime. You won't believe how simple this hack is, and once you learn about it, you will never want to go back to your old ways of wasting time and energy waiting for your device to recharge.

The Best Part? This Hack Is Easy! 

You won't need to be a tech genius to get started on this hack. The only thing you need is your Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro, and 5-20 minutes of spare time. The hack is simple: it involves a loading technique called the "power cycling hack". It's an easy process that consists of unplugging your device, turning it off and then powering it back on manually. By doing so, you will put your Gear Fit 2 Pro into hibernation mode, which allows the device to recharge at a much faster rate than when it is turned on.

Once your Gear Fit 2 Pro is off, you can plug it into your designated charging port and leave it there for 5-20 minutes without turning it back on. After you unplug it from the charger, turn it back on, and voila! Your device's battery life will be significantly improved, providing you with a much more extended duration of use before its next recharge.

How Does The Hack Work?

The reason why this hack works is that when the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro is on, the device consumes battery energy, making the charging time slower. When you power it off, it prevents the device from using any energy; it frees up energy that can be used to store more battery charge. By using this hack, you allow your device to bypass the regular charging cycle, saving your battery life for other activities that are essential for you. You can now listen to music, track your fitness, and more without the fear of the battery dying out.

Conclusion 

Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro is a great device that comes with a lot of nifty features designed to seduce tech enthusiasts. However, constant charging can turn the device into an energy hog, leading to a slow decline in battery life. With this "Revolutionary Charging Hack," you can prolong your Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro's lifespan by up to hours, making your time more productive and more comfortable. Don't hesitate to give this hack a try, and you will surely revolutionize the way you approach charging your device.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi - to continue with the title...to maybe charge!
I'm not sure if the charge contacts are sweat/hydraulic oil damaged. I have 3 chargers...all 3 have challenges.  Looking at the wrist contact side of the watch there appears to be "a lower contact". So, 1 contact is flush with the watch back and 1 is about .5mm lower (recessed). Any ideas to repair would be great. Once I eventually get the charger connected.  No problem to charge.
Any assistance appreciated. Thank you.
Martin

 Clean the contacts on both the watch and the chargers with isopropyl alcohol if you have it.
