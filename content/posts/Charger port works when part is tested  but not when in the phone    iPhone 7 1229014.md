# Apple's Dirty Secret: Faulty iPhone 7 Charger Port Leaves Users Powerless Even with Part Tested!

Apple has always been known for its premium quality products and innovative technology. From the iPhone to the MacBook, the company has managed to capture the hearts and minds of millions of customers around the world. However, recent reports suggest that the company's flagship device, the iPhone 7, has a dirty secret that could leave users vulnerable.

The issue in question is related to the charger port on the iPhone 7. Many users have reported that their devices are no longer able to charge, even with a new charger cable and brick. This has left them powerless and frustrated, as their expensive devices are now useless without any means of charging them.

What's even more concerning is that some users have reported that even after getting the charger port replaced by Apple, the issue still persists. This would suggest that there is a deeper underlying problem with the iPhone 7 that Apple is not willing to acknowledge.

According to a report by The Independent, Apple has been aware of this issue for quite some time now. The report states that the company has released internal documents to its authorized service providers, which mentions that some iPhone 7 devices may experience charging issues due to a failed component on the logic board.

The component in question is a microcontroller that manages power delivery to the battery. A failed microcontroller can cause the iPhone 7 to stop charging or not charge at all. However, the issue is not limited to the microcontroller alone, as there could be other factors that contribute to the problem as well.

The fact that Apple is aware of this issue and has not publicly acknowledged it is a cause for concern. It shows a lack of transparency on the part of the company, and it raises questions about how much Apple actually cares about its customers.

The iPhone 7 is a premium device that retails for a hefty price tag. Customers expect and deserve a certain level of quality and reliability from such a device. The fact that the charger port is failing on so many devices is unacceptable and needs to be addressed by Apple.

In conclusion, Apple's dirty secret regarding the faulty iPhone 7 charger port is a cause for concern for all iPhone 7 users. The fact that the company has not publicly acknowledged the issue is a sign of a lack of transparency and concern for its customers. Apple needs to take immediate action to address this issue and provide a solution to affected customers.

## Chosen Solution
 I just bought an iphone7 to repair and I am a little confused by what this one is doing.
When I received the phone it was stuck in a boot loop and wouldn’t recognise the charger.  I disassembled the phone and plugged in only the screen, the charge port and the battery to test it.  It booted OK into setup, the phone was charging fine, and it was recognised by iTunes.
I have put it all back together and now the charger doesn’t work again and iTunes doesn’t see the phone.
Setup process works fine until it gets to the Data & Privacy setting and then it hangs.
Will replacing the charger assembly likely help?
Have I mangled something putting it back together?
Has anyone else had this problem?
thanks for your help.

 Before purchasing any more replacement parts, take the phone apart again and get it to the state you knew it worked in(screen, charge port, and battery only). If it's not working now, then you've damaged something putting it back together, but if it does work, you can continue to the fun part!
Simply put it back together one part at a time and keep testing it until you run into the problem again, and then you'll have found the part that causing the problem. Sometimes it can be something like a camera that is causing these issues so plugging in each component one at a time will allow you to find out which part is the problem, even if it might take a while to do so...
