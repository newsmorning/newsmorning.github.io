Title: Warning: Samsung TVs' Major Flaw Exposed After Just 30-60 Mins - Beware Of Overheating Issues!

Introduction:
Samsung is one of the world's leading electronics brands that are widely popular for its TVs. With a range of brilliant features, Samsung TVs have set themselves apart from other brands. However, a recent report on the major flaw in Samsung TVs has raised concerns among the consumers. After just 30-60 minutes of usage, Samsung TVs have been found to overheat, which can cause damage to the TV and even pose a safety risk. In this article, we'll take a closer look at this major flaw and what you can do to protect yourself from overheating issues.

The major flaw in Samsung TVs:
According to a recent report, Samsung TVs are prone to overheating after just 30-60 minutes of usage. This issue has been reported across a range of Samsung TVs, including the popular QLED models. Overheating can cause damage to the internal components of the TV, which can lead to malfunctioning and even complete failure of the TV. Furthermore, overheating can pose a safety risk, as it can lead to electrical fires.

Reasons behind overheating in Samsung TVs:
There are several reasons why Samsung TVs overheat. The most common cause of overheating is a lack of proper ventilation. Samsung TVs generate a lot of heat, and if they are not properly ventilated, this heat can build up inside the TV and cause it to overheat. Additionally, dust and debris can accumulate inside the TV, which can also cause it to overheat.

How to protect yourself from overheating issues:
To protect yourself from overheating issues, there are a few things that you can do. Firstly, ensure that your Samsung TV is placed in a well-ventilated area. Avoid placing it in a confined space, such as a cabinet, as this can limit airflow and cause overheating. Additionally, it's crucial to regularly clean your Samsung TV to remove any dust and debris that may accumulate inside. You can use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the TV's exterior and a vacuum cleaner to remove any dust inside.

Conclusion:
It's important to note that not all Samsung TVs are affected by the overheating issue. However, it's vital to be aware of this major flaw and take steps to protect yourself from overheating issues. By ensuring proper ventilation and regular cleaning, you can minimize the risk of your Samsung TV overheating and prolong its lifespan. Always prioritize safety and follow the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure a safe and enjoyable viewing experience.

## Chosen Solution
 My 5 year old UE55KS8090T started acting weird about a week ago.
Initially the picture is perfect but, after 30-60 minutes a ghost image moves up and or down (scrolling?) . This happens on all channels and even the settings menu of the tv is not save.
If the television is left on, the picture changes to only multicolored, vertical lines.
When shut down for a couple of seconds, it jumps back to scrolling after 5-10min.
When shut down for a couple of hours, it gets closer to the 30-60 min. again.
Most of the electronics looks good in my inexperienced eyes (can provide picture/video). But one of the heatsinks has some discoloration.

 You need to call a Ghost Exorciser!
Seriously, though, an overheating issue is likely. A way to detect it is to use a can of freeze with a tube to pinpoint direct the spray to specific components. You can use a general spray to first narrow it down to a small area. If you can replace just the component you are good to go, but it may require replacing the whole assembly.
