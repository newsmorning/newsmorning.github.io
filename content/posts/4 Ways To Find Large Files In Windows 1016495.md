# Discover the Hidden Secrets of Windows 10: 4 Insanely Simple Ways to Unleash Your Computer's Hidden Power!

Windows 10 is a powerful and versatile operating system that can help you accomplish a lot of tasks more efficiently. From browsing the internet to creating complex presentations, Windows 10 has got you covered. However, there are many hidden secrets of Windows 10 that most users don't know about. In this article, we'll discuss 4 insanely simple ways to unleash your computer's hidden power and get the most out of Windows 10.

## 1. Use Virtual Desktops

Do you often work on multiple tasks simultaneously and find yourself constantly switching between them? Windows 10's Virtual Desktops feature can be a lifesaver in such situations. It allows you to create separate desktops for different tasks and switch between them seamlessly. For example, you can have one desktop for work-related tasks and another for social media or entertainment. To use Virtual Desktops, press the Windows key + Tab, and click on "New Desktop" on the top left of your screen. You can then switch between desktops by using the Windows key + Ctrl + Left or Right arrow keys.

## 2. Customize the Taskbar

The taskbar is an essential element of the Windows 10 interface that allows you to access frequently used apps and features easily. However, did you know that you can customize the taskbar to suit your preferences? You can add, remove, or rearrange icons on the taskbar and even change its location on the screen. To customize the taskbar, right-click on an empty area of the taskbar, and click on "Taskbar settings." Here, you can make a variety of changes, such as turning on/off the search bar, setting the date and time, and more.

## 3. Utilize the Clipboard History

The clipboard is a temporary storage area that holds data that you've copied or cut. In previous versions of Windows, you could only store one item in the clipboard at a time. However, in Windows 10, the Clipboard History feature allows you to store multiple items in the clipboard and access them later. To turn on Clipboard History, go to "Settings," click on "System," and then click on "Clipboard." Here, you can also clear your clipboard history, sync it across devices, and more.

## 4. Use Windows Timeline

Windows Timeline is another powerful feature in Windows 10 that allows you to keep track of your activity across multiple devices. It shows you a timeline of your recent activities, such as the websites you visited, the documents you worked on, and more. You can even sync your timeline across your Windows devices to continue your work where you left off. To access Windows Timeline, press the Windows key + Tab, and click on "Task View."

Conclusion

These are just a few of the many hidden secrets of Windows 10 that can help you unleash your computer's hidden power. So go ahead and explore these features, experiment with different settings, and discover what works best for you. With a little bit of knowledge and creativity, you can turn your Windows 10 PC into a productivity powerhouse!

If you quickly want to free up memory space on your Windows machine, the best way to do that is to find large files on your Windows 10 PC and get rid of them if they’re no longer useful. The question though is how do you go about searching for large files on your computer?
 
Windows provides you with multiple ways to find all the large files that are stored in your drives. Either you can use the built-in tools on your machine to look for these files or you can grab a third-party app that will do the task for you. Either way, you’ll find the files that occupy a significant portion of your memory space.
 
Once such files are found, it’s then up to you what you want to do with them. If deleting them permanently isn’t something you’d like to do straight away, you can move them over to cloud storage or to an external hard drive.

One of its abilities is to help you find files that are of a specific size on your computer. Using this feature, you can locate those memory-hogging files and get them removed from your PC.
 
Before you do that, though, you’ll need to first enable the hidden files option. This is to ensure that Explorer looks for large hidden files in addition to searching for the normal files.
 
However, be cautious when dealing with hidden files. Most of the time, these are system and app-related files which, if you delete, will cause your apps to malfunction and even lead your entire system to crash. Before you delete anything, just make sure you know what it is and you’ll be fine.
 
Open the Start Menu and search for Show hidden and click on Show hidden files and folders.
 
When the dialog box opens, click on the View tab at the top. You’ll see various File Explorer options that you can modify.
 
Find the option that says Show hidden files, folders, and drives and put a checkmark in it. Then click on the OK button to save your changes.
 
Double-click on This PC on your desktop to launch File Explorer. When the utility launches, click on the search box given at the top-right corner.

If what you consider as a large file isn’t available in the default menu, type in size:>1GB (replace 1GB with your size) in the search box and hit Enter. It’ll only look for files that are larger than your specified size.
 
When the search results appear, right-click anywhere blank and select Sort by followed by Size and Descending. This’ll ensure the largest file is shown at the top of the results.
 
## Search For Large Files In Windows 10 With Command Prompt

Press Windows + R, type in cmd, and hit Enter to launch the utility.
 
When it launches, type in the following command and hit Enter. It’ll find all the files that are larger than 1GB in size. You can modify the value in the command so it finds files that you think are large.forfiles /S /M * /C “cmd /c if @fsize GEQ 1073741824 echo @path > largefiles.txt
