Step 2: Remove the Old Bottom Shell

Once you have your tools in place, the next step is to remove the old bottom shell. Take your screwdriver and carefully unscrew all the screws on the bottom shell.

Carefully place it onto the drone and screw it in place. Ensure that all screws are in their rightful slots and tightened appropriately. Once you finish tightening, ensure that the bottom shell is firm and secure.
