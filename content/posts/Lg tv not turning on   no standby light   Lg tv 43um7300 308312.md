Is Your LG TV Dead? Find Out Why It's Not Turning On - Troubleshoot Your 43UM7300 Now!

Are you having trouble turning on your LG TV? Don't worry, you are not alone. Thousands of people face this issue every day, and it can be frustrating. A TV that doesn't turn on can be due to multiple reasons, and it's essential to understand the root cause before escalating the problem. In this article, we'll discuss why your LG TV is not turning on and how to troubleshoot the issue.

First, let's discuss why this problem can occur. The most common cause of a TV that won't turn on is a power supply issue. Here are a few things you can try to troubleshoot your TV:

1. Check the Power Cable

Sometimes, the power plug may have come loose from the wall socket, and the TV may not be receiving power. Check the power cable and ensure it's connected to the socket correctly.

2. Check the Power Outlet

If the power cable is connected correctly, check if the outlet is working. Plug in another device or appliance to see if it's working correctly.

3. Check the Remote Control

Sometimes the batteries in the remote control may have drained, and the TV may not be receiving the signal. Replace the batteries and try turning on the TV using the remote control.

4. Power Cycle the TV

Unplug the TV from the power outlet and wait for 5-10 minutes. Plug it back in and try turning it on. This resets the TV and sometimes fixes the issue.

5. Check for Software Updates

In some cases, software updates may have caused the TV to stop working. Check the LG website for any firmware updates and follow the instructions for updating the TV software.

If these solutions do not work, the issue may be more severe. It's important to remember to contact a professional repair service or contact LG Support for advanced troubleshooting or service options.

In conclusion, understanding why your LG TV is not turning on is a crucial step in troubleshooting the problem. The most common cause is a power supply issue, but there are other possibilities as well. By following the above steps, you can troubleshoot your TV and find a solution. If the solutions don't work, don't hesitate to call a professional repair service, or contact the LG support team for advanced troubleshooting.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey there my 1 year old tv just died this morning , I am trying to fix it myself, but I’m not sure what could be wrong with it, when I check the voltage on the power supply board I get fluctuating readings from 4-4.9 v and I hear a relay clicking . When I remove the connector from the logic board there’s no more clicking and the reading goes up to a constant 7.9 below I have attached pictures. Any help would be appreciated thanks

 We would need to know where you are measuring your voltage and why you are measuring there. Post some good pictures of your power board as well as your main board with your QUESTION. Remember that it is your main board that signals the power board to turn on. If you do not have STBY voltage then the issue is commonly on the power board. We would need to know exactly what board your TV has and try to find a schematic for it.
