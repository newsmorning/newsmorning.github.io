Loop Hero is an addictive card-based strategy game that gives you the power to control an adventurer in a desolate loop of dungeon crawling, battling and building. Among the various classes of characters that you can play, the Rogue is one of the most elusive and challenging to unlock. However, by following a few simple tips and tricks, you can easily unleash your inner Rogue and win the game without breaking a sweat.

Here’s how you can unlock the Rogue class in Loop Hero:

1. Build the Rogue Camp

To start, you need to create a Rogue camp, an essential element that unlocks the class. You can create a Rogue camp by placing a Forest adjacent to a Village on the map. Once you build the Rogue camp, you can unlock the Rogue trait and its equipment.

2. Equip Your Hero With Rogue Traits and Gear

Now that you have unlocked the Rogue trait, equip your hero with Rogue gear. What’s best about the Rogue is that it’s a versatile class that can excel in different equipment rankings. Weapons like the Rogue’s Dagger and the Bone Bow can enhance your hero’s damage output, while the Shadow Armor can minimize the damage received. The right combination of equipment will make your hero an unstoppable force of destruction.

3. Choose the Right Skills

Skills are essential in Loop Hero, and they can make or break a current run. Choosing the right skills can make a massive difference in unlocking the Rogue class. Skills like the Counter, the Assassin, and the Counter Strike can give your hero more chances to deal damage and avoid receiving hits.

4. Set Up the Right Environment

The right environment is key to unlocking the Rogue class. Some environments, such as the Spider Cocoon or the Battlefields, can provide your hero with specific traits and gear that are essential to unlocking the Rogue. To maximize your chances of unlocking the Rogue class, try to build the appropriate environment and place it near the Rogue camp.

5. Play the Game Strategically

Like most games, Loop Hero is all about strategy, and unlocking the Rogue class is no different. Play the game strategically by understanding the different mechanics, focusing on building the right environments, and equipping your hero with the right gear and skills. With the right moves and some patience, you can unlock the elusive Rogue class and take your game experience to the next level.

Conclusion

Unlocking the Rogue class in Loop Hero can be challenging, but with the right approach, you can unleash your inner Rogue and dominate the game. By creating a Rogue camp, equipping your hero with the right gear and skills, building the right environment, and playing strategically, you can easily unlock the Rogue class in no time. So, what are you waiting for? Make your mark on the loop and unleash your inner Rogue now!
