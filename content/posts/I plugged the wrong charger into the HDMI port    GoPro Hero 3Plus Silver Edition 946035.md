It was a hot summer day, and I was getting ready for my next adventure with my GoPro Hero 3 Plus Silver Edition. I checked to make sure everything was in order: fully charged battery, enough memory on the SD card, and a waterproof case.

As I reached for the charger, I realized my mistake. Instead of the regular GoPro charger, I had grabbed my phone charger. I considered running back to grab the right charger, but I was too eager to start my adventure, so I plugged my phone charger into my GoPro.

Little did I know that this simple mistake was about to teach me a valuable lesson about the importance of using the correct charger.

I started recording as I biked through the scenic route, with the wind blowing in my face and the sun shining bright. It was the perfect day for an adventure, or so it seemed.

Suddenly, my GoPro screen turned black, and the camera shut off. I panicked and started to check on the battery, but to my surprise, it was still at full charge. Confused, I decided to take a break and figure out what was wrong.

After a quick Google search, I found out that my mistake was the cause of my camera shutting down. Apparently, plugging the wrong charger into a device can cause irreversible damage to the battery and potentially the device itself.

I was heartbroken. I thought that my adventure was ruined, and my camera was now useless. But, I decided to give it one last try and plugged the correct charger in.

To my surprise, the camera came back to life, and I was able to finish recording my adventure with high-quality footage.

From that day on, I made a promise to myself to always check and double-check which charger to use for each device. I didn't want to make the same mistake again and risk losing my precious equipment.

In conclusion, my mistake taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of using the correct charger for the right device. Don't make the same mistake I did, always check and double-check which charger to use for each device to avoid permanent damage.

 What needs to be replaced on my GoPro Hero 3+ silver edition?

 @edubba123 there is no standard part that needs to be replaced. It will depend on your boards to see what has failed. Use these guides to work on your GoPro and take plenty of images. Post those with your question so we can see what you see. Use this guide for that. One of the parts you definitely will have to change is the battery.
