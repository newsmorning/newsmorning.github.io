Title: Stop Using Your Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3 NOW! Find Out Why You Need to Replace Your Ribbon Cable ASAP!

If you are a Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3 user, you might want to stop using your device right away. This is because the ribbon cable that connects the screen to the device's circuit board is experiencing a widespread fault, which can result in the screen going blank or appearing scrambled.

Many users are reporting this issue online, and it seems to be a common problem with the Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3. But why is the ribbon cable failing? And what can you do to fix the issue?

The Problem with the Ribbon Cable

The ribbon cable failure seems to be caused by a design flaw or a manufacturing defect. The cable is prone to wear and tear or getting pinched, which can result in a damaged connection. This damaged connection can cause the screen to fail, and the device becomes unusable.

Unfortunately, Sony doesn't offer an official replacement for the ribbon cable, and repairing the cable can be tricky. It involves taking the device apart, replacing the cable, and then reassembling it. This process might require special tools, knowledge, and expertise that many users don't have.

Why You Need to Replace the Ribbon Cable ASAP

Users should replace the ribbon cable ASAP if they want to keep using their Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3. This issue will only get worse over time, and eventually, the cable will fail altogether.

Moreover, the Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3 is a popular e-reader, and many users might have a lot of data and e-books stored on the device. Losing access to their content could be a significant loss, both financially and emotionally.

What Are Your Options?

If you are experiencing ribbon cable failure on your Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3, you have a few options. You can try repairing the ribbon cable yourself, but this process can be difficult and has a high risk of making the issue worse.

Another option is to look for a third-party repair service. However, these services can be expensive, and there is a risk that the repair won't be successful.

Your best option is to replace your Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3 altogether. While this might seem like a drastic solution, it is the safest and most reliable solution. You can buy a new e-reader, transfer your e-books and data, and continue reading without any interruptions.

Conclusion

If you are a Sony Reader Wi-Fi PRS T3 user, you should stop using your device if you are experiencing ribbon cable failure. This issue can cause the screen to go blank or appear scrambled, making the device unusable. While repairing the ribbon cable yourself or using third-party repair services are options, the best option is to replace your device altogether.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi all,
First off all, I did a screen replacement because the old screen was broken. After I reassembled it I had a few issues with the ebook again, so started to check what could be wrong but couldn't find an. So I've back together again. But after a usage of a couple of weeks the reader's battery was empty, and I wanted to charge it but nothing happened.
After a closer inspection I found out that I damaged the the flex/ribbon cable from the control/charging board.
The controls work fine but it won't charge nor connect to a pc anymore.
So my question is, what kind of flex/ribbon cable can I use to fix the problem?

 koffieleut if you are looking for the one that comes from the control board to the PCB,

those will be hard to find. It appears as if Sony does not sell those anywhere separately. You could try and see if you can scour a  reader of the same model as yours, but that is broken otherwise and harvest the cable from that. Or you could contact companies that make flat flexible cable systems like this one and see if they can match you up. Molex has long been the most common supplier of FFC and FPC cables, so you may just find what you need on here. Not easy, but repair never is.
