As I opened my fridge’s freezer section to grab some ice for my drink, I was met with a sight that made me want to gag: a thick, slimy substance was dripping from the freezer, coating everything in a disgusting, foul-smelling mess. I had never seen anything like it before, and I couldn’t help but wonder what could have caused this strange occurrence.\nImmediately, I set to work trying to figure out what was causing the mess. I removed all the food from the freezer and began examining the area, searching for any clues or signs of damage. At first, I couldn’t find anything obvious - no cracks or leaks were visible, and everything seemed to be in working order. However, as I dug deeper, I finally found the culprit: a clogged drain line.\nOver time, it’s common for the drain line in a freezer to become clogged with debris, which can cause water to accumulate and then freeze. This can lead to a buildup of ice and can eventually cause the freezer to leak. In my case, the clog was severe enough that it had caused a major backup of water, which had then dripped down and caused the slimy mess I had found.\nI immediately set to work fixing the problem. First, I unplugged the fridge and allowed the ice to thaw so I could access the drain line. Next, I used a long, thin tool to gently clear out the debris and remove the clog. Finally, I cleaned up the mess and made sure everything was working properly.\nThe experience was disgusting and frustrating, but it was also a valuable lesson. I learned the importance of regularly checking and maintaining my fridge and freezer, especially the drain line. I also learned that sometimes, even the smallest and seemingly insignificant things can cause big problems.\nSo, if you’re ever faced with a disgusting slimy mess in your fridge’s freezer section, don’t panic! Take a deep breath, investigate the problem, and get to work fixing it. Who knows - you might just learn something new in the process.\nChosen Solution I have a Side by side refrigerator freezer 12 years old. Seems like over night the freezer stopped working.

Before I call for help is the something I can check on my own?\nClogged or Freezing Defrost Drain If the refrigerator is leaking water it’s possible that the refrigerator has a clogged or freezing defrost drain. If the defrost drain freezes the defrost water will overflow the drain and drip down to the bottom of the compartment, If enough water accumulates in the bottom it can run out onto the floor. Thaw any ice that is clogging the drain. Make sure the drain is clear by flushing it with a turkey baster and HOT water. Water Tank Assembly If the refrigerator is leaking water the water tank assembly may have sprung a leak. Check the water tank assembly while it’s still in the refrigerator to see if the leak can be found. Keep in mind that the tank is not under pressure, it only holds water at a very low pressure and so the leak might be very small and hard to find. The tank can sometimes be made up of coiled tubing and is usually located behind the crisper drawers, behind a panel in the refrigerator section. If a leak is discovered, replace it. The plastic they use for the tank doesn’t accept glue very well. Water Inlet Valve If the refrigerator is leaking water the water valve may be cracked or have a loose fitting. The water inlet valve requires a minimum of 20 psi to shut off properly. If the water inlet valve does not shut off properly and the water pressure is good, replace the water inlet valve. Water Filter Housing If the refrigerator is leaking water the water filter housing might be cracked or broken. Inspect the housing thoroughly and replace it if any cracks are found. Water Filter Head If the refrigerator is leaking water the water filter head might be cracked or the seal might be torn or missing. Check the water filter housing carefully for any damage or defects. Drain Pan If the refrigerator is leaking water the drain pan might be cracked. All self-defrosting refrigerators have a drain pan. The drain pan is underneath the refrigerator or near the compressor. When the refrigerator goes into the defrost cycle the frost and ice that is melted off of the evaporator coils flows down a small tube and into the drain pan below. The condenser fan blows warm air from the condenser coils across the top of the drain pan to evaporate the water quickly and so the drain pan never has to be emptied. However, if it cracks, the water from the defrost cycle will spill out of the pan onto the floor. Water Filter If the refrigerator is leaking water the water filter might not be installed correctly. Remove and reinstall the filter to be sure it’s seated properly.\n","wordCount":"900","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Edward Sadler"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/i-noticed-water-dripping-on-floor-from-freezer-section-refrigerator-1961511/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe what I found dripping from my fridge's freezer section!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;900 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Edward Sadler</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=you-wont-believe-what-i-found-dripping-from-my-fridges-freezer-section>You Won&rsquo;t Believe What I Found Dripping from My Fridge&rsquo;s Freezer Section!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-wont-believe-what-i-found-dripping-from-my-fridges-freezer-section>#</a></h1><p>As I opened my fridge&rsquo;s freezer section to grab some ice for my drink, I was met with a sight that made me want to gag: a thick, slimy substance was dripping from the freezer, coating everything in a disgusting, foul-smelling mess.
