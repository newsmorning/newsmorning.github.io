You can’t open Control Panel? Take a look at this step-by-step guide to find a solution.
 
### 2. Check that you have studies enabled in Firefox
 
- Click the menu button at the top right of the Firefox window.
 - Click on Options.
 - Select the Privacy & Security panel.
 - Then, scroll down to the Firefox Data Collection and Use section.
 - Make sure the box next to Allow Firefox to install and run studies is checked.
 - If it isn’t, click it to checkmark the setting.

 
Do you get the following message with add-on signing in Firefox: Kaspersky Password Manager could not be verified for use in Firefox and has been disabled? It isn’t the first time when Firefox prevents existing and new add-ons from running or being installed.
 
The solution, in this case, is to make sure you have studies enabled as described above. When a study becomes available, you will be enrolled if you meet the criteria. This might not be music to your ears, but you can obviously disable studies again after your add-ons have been re-enabled.
 
As tempting as it may be, don’t delete your add-ons as this means that you are willing to lose any data related to the add-on too.
 
### 3. Run Kaspersky as an Administrator
 
Some Kaspersky users describe another attempt to fix the Kaspersky Password Manager error. When the software fails to automatically open on startup, they tried running it as an Administrator.
