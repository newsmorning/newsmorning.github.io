Bo Peep, on the other hand, can summon her sheep for an adorable and effective blockade.\nFrozen:\nThe Snow Queen Elsa, cheerful Anna, and the lovable snowman, Olaf, are ready to face the racing challenges in Arendelle. Each character has unique powers, with Elsa able to summon ice shards to immobilize her opponents, Anna can use her warm hugs to accelerate her car, and Olaf can create slippery ice trails that will slow down the competition.\nConclusion:\nDisney Speedstorm is a racing game that is just as much fun for adults as it is for kids.
