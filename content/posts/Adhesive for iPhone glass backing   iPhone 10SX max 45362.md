## Chosen Solution
 I am about to replace the back glass screen on my iPhone 10SX max. I am wondering what kind of glue/ adhesive I need to use?

 Hi Daniel,
It does not appear that we have the Rear Panel Adhesive Assembly available on iFixit. However, you could probably use Tesa Tape as a wonderful alternative: *click*.
Iâ€™m sure there will be other advice from others later on. :)
