## Chosen Solution
 I need a replacement logic board but my repairer is unable to locate one. Can anyone help???

 I think I found the part on iFixit, as well as eBay, but consult your repairman about this part before buying it though as it is pricy. iFixit is reccomended because of the quality of the parts so if you decide to get it from eBay buy it at your own risk.
Reccomended option: MacBook Pro 17" Unibody (Early 2009) 2.66 GHz Logic Board
