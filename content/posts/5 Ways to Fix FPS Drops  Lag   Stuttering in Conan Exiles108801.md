Title: Conan Exiles Players Rejoice: Here Are The Top 5 Ways To Banish Fps Drops, Lag And Stuttering Once And For All!

Introduction
For players of the popular survival game Conan Exiles, nothing can be more frustrating than experiencing occasional lags, stuttering, and fps drops while enjoying the gameplay. Even though the minimum system requirements are not demanding, players do tend to experience performance issues from time to time. Fortunately, we bring you the top five ways to optimize your gameplay and eliminate these performance issues once and for all.

1. Shutting Down Background Applications
It is always advisable to keep unnecessary background applications closed while playing Conan Exiles. These applications draw a significant amount of system resources and harm the game's performance, leading to stuttering and fps drops. Therefore, closing background apps like web browsers and game launchers will significantly improve game performance and ensure smooth gameplay.

2. Updating Windows & Drivers
Updating your system's drivers and Windows is essential for optimizing game performance. When outdated, these features can cause issues with the game's graphics, sound, and performance. As a result, keep your Windows operating system and drivers updated regularly to beat any system-related issues that may affect your gameplay.

3. Lowering your Graphics Settings
Conan Exiles offers an array of graphic settings to choose from, from very low to ultra settings. However, for a smoother gaming experience, players should lower the graphics settings to reasonable levels. By doing so, they can enjoy the game without experiencing lags, stuttering, or fps drops. Also, players should avoid settings like bloom, motion blur, and depth of field to boost their fps, resulting in an overall better gaming experience.

4. Overclock your GPU
Overclocking your graphics processing unit (GPU) can significantly boost your fps, giving you an advantage in combat scenarios. Regular GPU overclocking sessions can also help prevent stuttering and fps drops. Overclocking your GPU comes with a bonus that it gives you more extensive control over your GPU, allowing you to customize settings to optimize your gameplay.

5. Disabling V Sync
Disabling V Sync can improve game performance, especially if you have a higher-end PC. This feature typically limits your fps to match the refresh rate of your display, causing lag and stutter in the gameplay. Therefore, if you notice occasional frame drops and inconsistent frame rates, disable this feature from your system settings.

Conclusion
Now that you know the top five ways of optimizing your Conan Exile gameplay, you can tackle lag, stuttering, and fps drops like a pro. Ensure that you follow the tips, update your system, and reduce background apps to experience smooth gameplay, and enjoy the game to the fullest. With the right settings and optimization, you can explore the vast expanse of the game world without any performance hindrance.

## What effects FPS the most?
 
The graphics card and the CPU are the two components that have the most influence on the frame rate or the FPS performance of a game.
 
When it comes to playing online games, however, internet speed and ping are two additional factors that come into play.
 
However, before starting any tweaking, make sure that your system is on par with the minimum game requirements below.

## How do I fix Conan Exiles FPS drops?
 
### 1. Eliminate the background processes
 
- To open Task Manager, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc.
 - Select the Processes tab to find processes running in the background and using too many system resources.
 - Select the task and then close it by clicking End Task. Repeat for other similar tasks with the high processes.

 
Close any unnecessary programs, such as Chrome, Spotify, and OneDrive. Also, if Discord is idle, you should exit it. 
 
These unnecessary apps tend to consume excessive resources and computational power, leaving little power for your PC to use on the game, resulting in Conan Exiles FPS drops.

### 2. Adjust the game’s graphic settings

 - For instance, you may disable Vsync, enable the Low-End Laptop Mode, and set the View Distance, Post Processing, General Shadows, and Texture Quality to Low.
 - Test various settings until you get to acceptable game performance.

 
If you have screen tearing while playing, you should re-enable Vertical Sync. The above settings will increase the game’s frame rate while decreasing frame drops.
 
### 3. Add Steam launch options
 
- Navigate to the list of titles in your Steam Library.
 - Right-click Conan Exiles and choose Properties.
 - Find the General tab, then click the Launch Options box.

 - Find the Display Adapters category and expand it by clicking on it.

 - Then choose Search automatically for drivers.

 
Because outdated drivers are the source of most Windows issues, you should first update your graphics card drivers if your FPS drops. 
 
Fortunately, Windows automatically updates the drivers, but this does not ensure that compatibility issues will not occur.
 
### 5. Disable the fullscreen optimization
 
- Navigate to the game’s installation folder: go to Steam, Library, Conan Exiles, Properties, LOCAL FILES, then BROWSE LOCAL FILES.
 - Right-click ConanSandbox.exe. and select the Properties.
 - In the Compatibility tab, tick Disable full-screen optimizations.

 
The Fullscreen Optimizations feature was developed to improve the game experience. However, it can occasionally cause FPS drops.
 
To make sure that everything goes smoothly and avoid any kind of GPU driver errors, be sure to use a complete driver update assistant that will solve your problems with just a couple of clicks, and we strongly recommend DriverFix. Follow these easy steps to safely update your drivers:

 - Wait for the app to download and install the newest drivers.
 - Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

 
 Disclaimer: this program needs to be upgraded from the free version in order to perform some specific actions.
 
### DriverFix
 
 Keep you GPU on the peaks of their performance without worrying about its drivers.

 
### Can RAM cause stuttering?
 
Yes, stuttering could be caused by a RAM shortage. Your system will stutter if you don’t have enough RAM since it can’t handle all the information rapidly.
 
Games handle all the data in real time and require a lot of RAM. As a result, RAM that is defective or inadequate might stutter.
 
Conan Exiles is undoubtedly one of the greatest games in its genre, but FPS drops, and stuttering may quickly ruin the fun of playing it.
 
The best thing to do is to reduce the game’s graphic settings or look on the web for the optimal option that will maintain quality while still giving you adequate performance.
