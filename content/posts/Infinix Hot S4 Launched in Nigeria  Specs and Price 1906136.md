One of the most remarkable features of the Infinix Hot S4 is its camera.

What makes the Infinix Hot S4 even more attractive is its price. The device retails at a very affordable price of just ₦49,900, making it accessible to the majority of Nigerians. This has positioned the smartphone as a serious contender in the Nigerian market, in competition with more established brands like Samsung, Huawei, and Tecno.

The Infinix Hot S4's incredible features at such an affordable price point have made it the talk of the town in Nigeria. People have been lining up to purchase the device, with some even pre-ordering it online to get ahead of the queue.

It's safe to say that the Infinix Hot S4's impressive reception is a testament to the growing sophistication of the Nigerian market and the increasing demand for better and more affordable devices.


Today — at an event held at The Lagos Continental, Lagos, Nigeria — Infinix Mobility unveiled its latest offering from its “Hot S” series of mid-range smartphones. Dubbed the Infinix Hot S4, the device succeeds the Infinix Hot S3 and is the first device from the Chinese smartphone manufacturer to come out-of-the-box running the Android 9 Pie OS. Design-wise, it is also the first device from the OEM to have a waterdrop-shaped display notch and triple rear-camera setup.
 
## Body form and Build
 
The device will be available in three different color variants (Milan Black, Sapphire Cyan, Gold) with 2.5D glass covering both on the front and on the rear. Also, with a dimension of 152.2 x 73 x 7.9 mm and weight of 141 grams, the Infinix Hot S4 is incredibly slim and lightweight. The front of the device houses a full-view 6.2-inch Full-HD+ display with a waterdrop notch. Flip the device to the other side and you’ll be greeted by three sensors at the top-right corner of the Hot S4’s rear. The squared-shaped fingerprint sensor is also neatly embedded on the rear, right above the Infinix logo.
 
On the right-hand side of the device are the power button and volume adjustment buttons — atypical of other Infinix devices.
 
## Processor
 
The device will be powered by Mediatek’s Helio P22 SoC alongside four cores of Cortex-A53 processors with maximum clock speed of 2.2GHz. The Hot S4 runs the latest version of Infinix’s native XOS (v4.0 HoneyBee) which is based on Google’s latest Android 9.0 Pie operating system. As mentioned earlier, this is the first smartphone from the OEM to launch with Android 9 Pie out-of-the-box.
 
Lastly, to handle gaming and graphic-demanding tasks on the Hot S4, Infinix fitted a PowerVR GE8320 GPU on the device; the innards of the Infinix Hot S4 are really impressive.
 
## Storage
 
The Infinix Hot S4 is available in two variants based on storage configuration. The base version comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in memory while the bigger variant has a storage combination of 6GB RAM and 64GB ROM. Both variants, however, possess an SD card slot which supports storage expansion up to 128GB.
 
## Camera
 
The Hot S4 is Infinix’s first shot at a triple rear camera setup. The device has a primary 13MP camera with an f/2.0 aperture, a secondary 8MP sensor and a third 2MP f/2.0 wide-angle lens. The lenses are aligned vertically and below them is a Quad-LED flash for effective subject illumination under conditions of low-light.
 
Housed within the water-drop notch on the front is a 32MP selfie camera. Some features of the Hot S4 camera include Portrait mode, Auto-HDR, Geo-tagging, Touch focus, Face detection, Panorama and 1080P @ 30fps.
 
## Battery & Connectivity
 
A 4,000mAH battery is enclosed within the Hot S4’s glossy body. There’s no official information regarding standby and expected usage time but given how well battery of the same capacity performs on previous Infinix device, the Hot S4 should be able to deliver up to a day’s usage before needing to recharge. The Infinix Hot S4 can be charged via the micro USB port at the bottom of the device. There’s also support for Fast Charging.
 
Connectivity options on the Infinix Hot S4 include 4G LTE connectivity, WiFi (IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n ), WiFi hotspot, Bluetooth v5.0, GPS, 3.5mm jack etc.
 
## Infinix Hot S4 Price & Availability
 
The 3GB RAM + 32GB version of the Hot S4 has a recommended retail price (RRP) of NGN 49,900 while the bigger variant (Hot S4 Pro) with 6GB RAM and 64GB internal storage will retail for NGN 64,500.
