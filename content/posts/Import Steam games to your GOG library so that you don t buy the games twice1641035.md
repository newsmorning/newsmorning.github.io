# Stop Wasting Money on Steam - Discover How to Import Your Games to GOG and Save Big!

In the world of PC gaming, Steam has been the undisputed king for a long time. The platform has built up an enormous library of games and has become the go-to store for gamers everywhere. However, there's a hidden cost to all this convenience - you're often paying full price for games that you'll never actually own. But what if there was a way to save money on Steam purchases and actually own your games? Enter GOG.

GOG, or Good Old Games, is a digital distribution platform similar to Steam. However, GOG has one major advantage over Steam - DRM-free games. When you purchase a game on GOG, you actually own it. You can download it, install it, backup it, and even share it with your friends. And unlike Steam, you don't need to be online to play your games. With GOG, you truly own your games, and that's something that's hard to put a price on.

"But wait," you may be thinking, "I've already got a bunch of games on Steam. I don't want to have to repurchase all of them on GOG." Fear not, my fellow gamer. With GOG Connect, you can import many of your existing Steam games to GOG for free.

Here's how it works. First, you'll need to create a GOG account if you don't already have one. Then head over to the GOG Connect page and log in with your Steam account. From there, GOG will scan your Steam library and show you which games are eligible for import. These games will have a "Connect" button next to them. Simply click the button, and the game will be added to your GOG library.

It's important to note that not all games are eligible for GOG Connect. The program is limited to certain titles, and the list of eligible games may change over time. Additionally, you'll need to connect your Steam account to GOG every time you want to import new games.

But even with these limitations, GOG Connect is an incredibly useful tool for PC gamers who want to save money and actually own their games. By importing your Steam games to GOG, you'll have access to a DRM-free library that you can download, install, and backup at your leisure. Plus, GOG often has sales and discounts that are even better than Steam's, so you can save money on new games too.

In conclusion, if you're tired of throwing money at Steam and never actually owning your games, it's time to give GOG a try. With GOG Connect, you can import many of your existing Steam games to your DRM-free GOG library and start saving money today. So what are you waiting for? Give it a try and see for yourself how much money you'll save in the long run.
