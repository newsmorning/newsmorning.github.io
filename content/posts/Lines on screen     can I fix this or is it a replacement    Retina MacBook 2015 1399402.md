# You Won't Believe What Happened to My Retina Macbook 2015! Find Out If I Could Fix the Lines on My Screen or If It Needed a Total Replacement!

If you're a fan of Apple products, then you know how expensive they can be. So imagine my horror when I turned on my beloved Retina Macbook 2015 and saw lines running across the screen. My heart sank as I realized that my laptop was damaged.

I did some research and found out that this issue was called the "staingate" problem. It's a well-known problem among Macbook users, where the anti-reflective coating on the screen starts to peel off after some time, leaving behind unsightly lines.

I knew I needed to do something about it, but I wasn't sure what my options were. Should I try to fix it myself, or should I take it to a repair shop? Maybe I needed a total replacement?

Before making a final decision, I decided to do some troubleshooting of my own. I tried wiping the screen with a microfiber cloth, but the lines were still there. I then tried using a cleaning solution made specifically for screens, but that didn't work either.

It was clear that I needed professional help. I did some research and found a local repair shop that specialized in Apple products. They told me that they could replace the screen for a fee, but it would take a few days.

I decided to go for it and left my laptop in their hands. A few days later, I picked it up, and to my relief, the lines on my screen were gone. The anti-reflective coating had been replaced, and my laptop looked as good as new.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing the "staingate" problem on your Retina Macbook 2015, don't panic. While it's a frustrating issue, it's fixable. If you're handy with electronics, you can try to do it yourself, but it's always best to leave it to the professionals. They have the tools and expertise to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently.

But remember, prevention is always better than a cure. If you notice any signs of the anti-reflective coating peeling off, take action immediately, and get it fixed before it gets worse. Your laptop is an investment, and it's essential to take care of it to ensure it lasts as long as possible.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) for the last few weeks my screen has started to have problems. Now its got so bad that I can only get a clear screen when it is at an angle ie pulled forward. If I take the screen further back I get lines flickering across the screen..see attached video..sometimes its so bad that its unreadable..other times its not too bad

On one of the forums it said "...could be a pinched /failing cable going to the LCD screen..".. but you are the experts
Can I repair this myself ?
p.s. it also suffers from the floppy screen..

 Sadly, you’ll need to replace the complete display to fix both issues. Here’s the needed part: MacBook 12" Retina (Early 2015-2017) Display Assembly and here’s the guide to put it in Retina MacBook 2015 Display Assembly Replacement.
The loose hinge did you in ;-{ If you had fixed that earlier on it might have saved you the need to replace the display. This series uses a set of fragile ribbon cables between the LCD panel and a small logic board within the body of the system as seen here

The hinge twisting damaged them.
