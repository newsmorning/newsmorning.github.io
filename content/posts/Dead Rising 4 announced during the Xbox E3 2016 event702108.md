Dead Rising fans rejoice! Microsoft just announced at E3 2016 that Dead Rising 4 is on its way. Gamers will be able to play their favorite zombie slayer, Frank West, once again in a new game that promises to be bigger and better than ever before.

At E3, Xbox unveiled a trailer for Dead Rising 4, which showed Frank West returning to Willamette, Colorado, where the original game was set. The town is once again overrun by zombies, and it’s up to Frank to save the day.

The trailer showcased some of the new weapons that will be available, including a crossbow that shoots fireworks and a vehicle with a massive flamethrower attached to the roof. There will also be new zombie types, such as a zombie that can camouflage itself and appear as a regular human.

Dead Rising 4 promises to be a more open world game than its predecessors, allowing players to explore the town and take on side quests as well as the main storyline. The game will also feature co-op play for up to four players, giving fans the chance to team up and take on the zombie hordes together.

The first Dead Rising game was released back in 2006 and quickly became a fan favorite. It was praised for its innovative gameplay and ability to let players create their own weapons from a range of everyday objects found around the game world. Over the years, the series has developed a following and become one of the most popular zombie games on the market.

Dead Rising 4 is being developed by Capcom Vancouver and will be an exclusive title for Xbox One and Windows 10. The game is set to be released in December 2016, just in time for the holiday season.

In a statement about the game, Xbox Head Phil Spencer said, “Dead Rising 4 marks the return of Frank West in an all-new chapter of one of the most popular zombie game franchises of all time. With the new EXO Suit, Frank can now rip down any zombie that gets in his way. This is zombie-slaying at its finest.”

Fans are already eagerly anticipating the release of Dead Rising 4, and it’s sure to be one of the biggest games of the year. With new weapons, new zombies, and a more open world to explore, this game promises to take the franchise to the next level. Get ready to don your zombie-slaying gear and take on the undead once again!

This time, Williamette Memorial Megaplex Mall is overrun by zombies and Frank will need again to discover the cause of this.
 
Likewise in Dead Rising 3, Frank will be able to travel outside the mall and explore the surroundings to find weapons and hints. With Frank having been infected since the end of the first game, it is not yet known if he will be able to use Zombrex in order to slow down the transformation
 
Dead Rising 3 received some pretty solid reviews and it seems that the developers understood that they need to bring back some of the features found in the game prior to Dead Rising 4.
