The good news is that there is a quick and easy fix for this issue, and it all has to do with a driver update that was included in the Creators Update.\nFirst, let’s discuss why this problem is occurring. After the Creators Update was installed, some Dell laptops began experiencing issues with the Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) driver. This driver is responsible for managing the storage devices in your computer, and if it’s not working properly, it can cause a variety of problems – including the inability to boot up your computer.\nThankfully, the solution to this problem is relatively simple. Dell has released a new version of the RST driver that is compatible with the Creators Update, and all you need to do is install it. Here’s how:\nGo to the Dell support website (support.dell.com) and enter your computer’s service tag or model number.\nNavigate to the “Drivers and Downloads” section and find the “Intel Rapid Storage Technology” driver.\nDownload and install the latest version of the driver that is compatible with the Creators Update.\nRestart your computer and check to see if the issue has been resolved.\nIt’s important to note that some users may not be able to install the new driver because their computer won’t boot up at all. If this is the case, you can try booting your computer in safe mode and installing the new driver from there. Here’s how:\nPower on your computer and immediately start tapping F8 until you see the Advanced Boot Options screen.\nSelect “Safe Mode with Networking” and press Enter.\nOnce your computer has booted up in safe mode, go to the Dell support website and follow the steps outlined above to download and install the new RST driver.\nRestart your computer and check to see if the issue has been resolved.\nIn conclusion, if you’re experiencing boot problems with your Dell laptop after the Creators Update, the culprit is likely the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver. By downloading and installing the latest version of the driver from the Dell support website, you can quickly and easily fix the issue and get your computer up and running again.\nMany Dell laptop owners who installed the Windows 10 Creators Update on their computers have encountered black screen issues on boot. More specifically, Dell laptops may wake to a black screen after closing and opening the lid.\nDownload Restoro PC Repair Tool that comes with Patented Technologies (patent available here).\nClick Start Scan to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems.\nClick Repair All to fix issues affecting your computer’s security and performance\nRestoro has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.\nThe good news is that this issue affects only three Dell laptop models: Alienware 17 R4, Precision M7710 and Precision M6800. In order to restore the display, users need to perform a hard reboot. Unfortunately, the problem occurs again the next time users close and open the lid.\nHere’s how one user describes this issue:\nHow to fix black screen after boot on the Creators Update The black screen is caused by a known issue with the GeForce display driver used in these laptops models and the Creators Update.\nMy computer update last night to the Creator’s Update and this morning I have a black screen with only the mouse cursor.

(cannot see what I am typing).\nTo fix this problem, you can download and install the GeForce driver hotfix that NVIDIA has released to address this issue. You can download the hotfix from NVIDIA’s support page.\nThe updated display driver is also being released to these devices through Windows Update.\nHave you encounter this problem on other laptop models?
