## Chosen Solution
 Hi the posts on similar subjects seem to be 2 years old and I can't find a good on-line resource.
I have the late mac mini 2014 model with PCI flash only. I want to add a hard disk drive to increase internal storage and create a single fusion model.
Can someone confirm whether this is possible and which kit in need to buy. I've understood that the sata cable for the HHD is not included in the PCI-only version.
Many thanks

 Yes, you can add in a HD drive in an Apple blade SSD based system.
Here's the IFIXIT guide you'll need to follow: Mac Mini Late 2014 Hard Drive Replacement and you'll need this cable, screws & bushings, as well as the needed tool: Mac Mini Dual Drive Kit.
As to creating a Fusion Drive you'll need to run the command line argument following this article: How to create and disable a Fusion Drive

 Can someone confirm that the "Mac mini dual drive kit" linked to in the reply is what you need to add a hard drive to an SSD only 2014 Mac mini? The page for that kit says it is for 2011 and 2012 Mac minis, it doesn't mention the 2014 at all.
