You'll Never Believe Why Your Kindle Voyage Won't Charge - Charging Jack Sloppy to Blame!

If you own a Kindle Voyage, the chances are that you love reading books on it. However, what happens when it won't charge? Before you start to panic, there's a good chance that the problem might be with your charging jack.

The Kindle Voyage is designed to be sleek and lightweight, and this has been achieved by making the charging jack compact. Unfortunately, this comes with a downside where the jack may become sloppy over time. The jiggling motion of the plug can eventually lead to a weakening of the solder joints inside the jack, which can cause some connectivity issues. This can make it difficult for the charging cord to stay in place, and make it tough to maintain a proper charging connection.

But don't worry - this problem isn't irreversible! There are several things that you can do to fix it and get your Kindle Voyage charging again.

First and foremost, try to rule out the obvious: check your charging cord and power outlet. Make sure your cord isn't frayed or damaged in any way and that your power source is working correctly. If none of these seem to be the issue, then check the charging jack itself. You can use a magnifying glass to inspect the inside of the jack carefully.

If you see any visible damage to the jack, it may be best to have it repaired or replace it altogether. However, if you don't see any visible damage or debris, then it might be time to apply some pressure and get those soldering joints back in place. Gently use a small tool like a toothpick or a miniature screwdriver to push each contact into position. You can also use an adhesive to reinforce the joints to prevent future issues.

Another option would be to purchase a charging dock, which can be useful if you often find yourself needing to charge your Kindle Voyage. A dock will keep the charging port sturdy and reduce the risk of it becoming sloppy again. Plus, it will hold your Kindle in place securely while it charges.

In conclusion, if your Kindle Voyage won't charge, there's no need to panic. Check the charging cord, power source, and charging jack carefully. If the jack is sloppy, then try to reposition it or reinforce the soldering contacts. This should help you get back to reading on your Kindle in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 Can't charge, jack seems loose or sloppy.  Tried several cord, plug, adapter etc.

 The USB charge port on the Kindle may have been loosened over time from use.  The charge port is soldered to the logic board and often times the solder joints will loosen and break free.  If this is the case then you can usually just solder the loose pins back in place.  You may need to replace the USB charge port if the original port has damage such as broken pins and so on.  You can use the guides here to get the back case off.  Inspect the charge port for loose solder joints or other damage to determine if you need a new port or can resolder the current port.  Hope this helps.

 The charge port needs to be repalaced, refute to ifixit repair guids or take to your local repair shop.

 I took it to a small computer repair shop. They told me it was the motherboard. I find that hard to believe. I donâ€™t think they have worked on a kindle before. Where do you suggest I take it? I live in Upland, CA.
