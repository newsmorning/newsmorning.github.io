 Hello, I found that you can force the phone to shutdown by pressing both the power + the volume down buttons for 5s (maybe more), I tried that on my A12 but my phone works fine unlike yours, so maybe it will work for you too.
I’ll look for another solution while you try this one, if nothing works then you have to wait until the battery drains out.
