Title: Are You a Debtor in Possession or Creditor in Control? Find Out the Shocking Truth About Your Rights and Power!

Introduction:
In the world of business, financial difficulties can arise at any time. This can lead to situations where companies are unable to pay their debts to creditors, suppliers, and other stakeholders. In such cases, it is the court that often intervenes and appoints a Debtor in Possession (DIP) or a Creditor in Control (CIC) to manage the assets and liabilities of the company. But do you know what rights and powers these individuals have? If not, keep reading to find out the shocking truth about your rights and power!

What is a Debtor in Possession (DIP)?
A Debtor in Possession is typically appointed by the court in situations where a company is filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. A DIP is usually a representative of the company and is responsible for managing the company's assets and liabilities during the bankruptcy process. They have the power to make decisions about selling assets, honoring contracts, and restructuring the company's debts.

What is a Creditor in Control (CIC)?
A Creditor in Control is appointed by the court in situations where a company is in financial distress and unable to pay its debts. Typically, a CIC is appointed by the court when the creditors of the company believe that the company cannot be rehabilitated through a bankruptcy proceeding. The CIC takes over the management of the company and has the power to make decisions about selling assets, honoring contracts, and restructuring the company's debts.

The Shocking Truth About Your Rights and Power:
If you are a Debtor in Possession, you may think that you have complete control over the management of the company during the bankruptcy process. However, the reality is that the court has the power to oversee and even veto any decision that you make. This means that you have limited power to make decisions about the company's assets and liabilities.

On the other hand, if you are a Creditor in Control, you may think that you have complete control over the management of the company. However, the reality is that you also have limited power to make decisions about the company's assets and liabilities. This is because the court will often appoint an independent mediator or trustee to oversee the CIC's decisions.

Conclusion:
In summary, being a Debtor in Possession or a Creditor in Control gives you some power and control over the management of a company in financial distress. But the reality is that you have limited power and are subject to court oversight. Therefore, it is important for anyone involved in such situations to have a clear understanding of their rights and powers to make informed decisions. So, if you find yourself in a similar situation, make sure to seek legal advice and take informed actions to protect your interests.

Key Takeaways

 
- The debtor in possession (DIP) is an insolvent person or a corporation where creditors have the right over their assets and property. Debtors need to file Chapter 11 under the Bankruptcy Code. In 1800, Congress enacted the first Bankruptcy Code for the interest of debtors and creditors. It includes Chapters 7, 11, and 13. Chapter 11 instructs the DIP to avoid disposing of the existing assets and possession unless all claims are settled.A creditor in the control committee includes the largest (20) creditors who did not receive their claims from the debtors. Thus, they hold the right to takappropriateul action against them.

 
### How Does Debtor In Possession Financing Work?
 
The debtor in possession is a title designated (given) to a debtor in bankruptcy where creditors have a claim over the debtor’s assets. A debtor turns DIP when they file for bankruptcy. The debtor in possession account appears in Chapter 11 of Bankruptcy of the United States Penal Code. However, it comes with specific strict rules and regulations. 
 
In a typical debtor in possession (DIP) scenario, the debtor makes an effort to recover some value from their assets after filing for bankruptcy. Therefore, A DIP may carry on operating with those assets. However, the court must approve any actions outside the thordinaryal course of business.
 
Additionally, the DIP must insure any property, maintain accurate financial records, and submit accurate tax filings. The ability to continue operating a firm while having the authority and responsibility to do so in the best interest of any creditors is the main benefit of having DIP status.
 
The debtor-in-possession credit facility provides funding to bankrupt companies. However, before accessing the DIP facility, the debtors must file Chapter 11 of Bankruptcy with the U.S. Court of Justice. Besides, they need to fulfill many other formalities, like the following:
 
– They cannot sell or dispose of any company asset without the court’s permission. 
 
– Debtors can conduct the ordinary course of business during this phase. 
 
– They are given a whole 120 days after filing to reconstruct their business plan. 
 
– Use the time to negotiate with the creditors and other shareholders.  
 
### History
 
The debtor in possession history relates to its legislation in 1978. During the 19th century, the rate of bankruptcies in European countries and America increased. Throughout the 1700s, there were 41 to 86 defaults in these nations. Thus, the administrators put these default entities and individuals into the debtor’s prison. As a result, a system that regulated bankruptcy became necessary. However, although bankruptcy rules existed, the debtors and creditors still suffered.
 
Thus, in 1800, Congress proposed the U.S. Bankruptcy Act. It included Chapter 7, Chapter 11, and Chapter 13. Each of them had certain rights and liabilities for debtors and creditors. Chapter 11 specially governed the debtors in the possession credit facility. The main reason was to protect the interest of creditors and allow debtors to operate their businesses alongside. Also, the debtors can come out of financial distress through DIP financing. 
 
### Rules And Guidelines
 
Let us look at the prescribed rules and guidelines by the Federal Court of Justice on the debtor in possession check:
 
- The debtors need to follow the Bankruptcy Code in all aspects.Pay all the post-petition debts and obligations if due. These include general business expenses, wages, payroll, property, and sales taxes.File all the due state, local, and Federal taxes.No pre-petition and professional employment fees, even though they arise from post-petition. Until the court does not approve it, they are forbidden to do so. Disposal of any possession or property cannot occur unless the creditor claims are settled. Debtors cannot use any cash collateral in the phase of bankruptcy without a court order. Also, they cannot obtain any secured or unsecured credit and debt. Maintain all insurance payments thereon if any are due. Upon the filing of Chapter 11, the court’s debtor in possession check forces them to present the insurance proof along with a “Certificate of Holder.”The post-filing orders the debtors to close any existing bank accounts immediately. Thus, open a new debtor in possession account and a new payroll account.  Funds held during the bankruptcy phase should be deposited in this new account, complying with the United States Trustee. However, it should be within the approved limits.Mention the 20 largest creditors with a significant interest claim on the debtor’s assets.   Present all the required documents at the Debtors and creditors conference. According to the DIP check, the debtors must pay quarterly fees. The minimum DIP fee is $325 if there are no default payments.

 
If DIP fulfills all the mentioned compliances, the court might allow their operations. As a result, the debtor in possession lenders might also help them to fund their businesses.  
 
### Example
 
Let us look at the debtor in possession example to comprehend the concept better. 
 
In October 2022, LATAM Airlines Group finally exited the Bankruptcy case after securing the required financing. According to the Santiago-based airlines, they received funding of $5.4 billion from the debtor in possession lenders. Besides, during this bankruptcy process, they reduced the debt by up to 35%Furthermore, another e-cigarette-making firm, Juul Labs Inc signed for DIP financing in a similar month. 
 
### Debtor In Possession Vs Creditor In Control
 
Although DIP and creditors in control are a part of Chapter 11, they differ slightly. While the former involves the debtor, the latter includes the creditors waiting for their default claim. In addition, the DIP allows insolvent debtors to maintain assets in bankruptcy.
 
However, if these debtors fail to make respective payments to the creditors, the latter can keep a committee on this. Per the creditor in control committee, if the debtor does not pay within 10 days, they can lawfully get a claim under insolvency.
