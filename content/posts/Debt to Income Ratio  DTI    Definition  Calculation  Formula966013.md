Title: Shocking Truth Revealed: You're Probably Doing Your Debt-To-Income Ratio Calculation All Wrong!

Introduction:
Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the percentage of your monthly income that goes towards paying off debt. It’s a crucial factor in determining your creditworthiness and affordability for loans. A high DTI ratio indicates that you're overburdened with debt, which can lead to financial distress. However, recent studies have revealed that most people are doing their DTI ratio calculation incorrectly, making it appear lower than it actually is. In this article, we’ll explore the shocking truth and help you understand how to calculate your DTI ratio correctly.

What is a Debt-to-Income Ratio?
Your DTI ratio is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. This includes all your recurring monthly debt obligations such as mortgage or rent payments, car loans, credit card payments, student loans, and any other debt obligations.

Incorrect Calculation Method:
Most people tend to make the mistake of using their net income (after-tax income) instead of their gross income to calculate their DTI ratio. This makes it appear lower than it actually is, as the tax and other deductions will reduce your overall income. For example, if you earn $5000 a month and have $2000 in monthly debt obligations, your DTI ratio would be 40% ($2000/$5000). However, if you use your net income of $4000 instead of gross income, your DTI ratio would appear lower at 50%($2000/$4000) which may lead you to believe that you're in a better position than you actually are.

Correct Calculation Method:
To calculate your DTI ratio correctly, you need to use your gross monthly income. This is the money you earn before any deductions are made such as taxes, insurance, and retirement contributions. For example, if you earn $5000 and have the same $2000 in monthly debt payments, your DTI ratio would be 40%($2000/$5000).

Why is it Important to Calculate your DTI Ratio Correctly?
Your DTI ratio is a crucial factor in determining your creditworthiness and affordability for loans. Most lenders use this ratio to evaluate your financial health and decide whether or not to approve your loan application. A high DTI ratio can indicate that you're overburdened with debt and may have difficulties making payments on time. This may lead to banks declining your loan application or offering you a higher interest rate, which can be costly in the long run.

Conclusion:
It's crucial to calculate your DTI ratio correctly to know your true financial situation. By using your gross monthly income instead of your net income, you can get an accurate representation of your debt-to-income ratio. If you find that your DTI ratio is high, it's time to make some adjustments to your finances to reduce your debt obligations. This may mean decreasing your expenses, increasing your income, or paying down your debt. By doing so, you can improve your creditworthiness, affordability for loans, and overall financial health.

Let us explore the following DTI ratio example below to understand the concept and calculation:
 
David applies for a credit card for smaller purchases. The credit card company asks him to provide his proof of income. It finds that David earns around $10,000 per month. Thus, the company calculates the ratio to check if it fulfills the company’s repayment terms.
 
The company also asks for details about the other debts that David has to pay. It comes to know that the credit card seeker has a mortgage loan of $2,000 and a car loan of $1,000 to pay every month. Based on the information, it calculates the DTI ratio:
 
       = (2000 + 1000) / (1000) = 3000/1000 = 30%
 
David’s credit card application gets approved as he fulfills the company’s repayment terms.
