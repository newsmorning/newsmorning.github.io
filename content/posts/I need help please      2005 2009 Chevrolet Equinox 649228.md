Desperate Plea for Assistance: Owners of 2005-2009 Chevrolet Equinox MUST Read This NOW!

Are you an owner of a 2005-2009 Chevrolet Equinox? If so, this article is a must-read for you. A significant issue has recently come to light that could potentially be dangerous for you and your passengers. This issue has been largely ignored by General Motors (GM), and we need to bring attention to it immediately for the safety of all involved.

The Problem

The issue lies with the fuel pump module, a vital component responsible for delivering fuel from your gas tank to your engine. It has been found that the module housing could crack, allowing fuel to leak and potentially ignite a fire. This is especially dangerous in the event of a crash, as it increases the risk of a vehicle fire and explosion, putting occupants' lives in danger.

The Solution

In 2016, GM issued a recall for certain models of the 2009-2010 Equinox as well as the 2010 GMC Terrain due to the fuel pump module housing issue. However, in a strange move, they excluded the 2005-2008 models, despite the same issue being present in those vehicles. This decision has caused widespread frustration and anger among owners of these cars, many of whom have reported experiencing the same issue of fuel leaking.

If you are an owner of a 2005-2008 Chevrolet Equinox, it is vital that you take action right away. There are a few things you can do to protect yourself, your passengers, and others on the road.

Firstly, pay close attention to any signs of a fuel leak. Common indicators include the strong smell of gas near the vehicle, a visible stain or wet spot beneath the car, or a decrease in fuel efficiency. If you notice any of these signs, do not continue driving the car, and get in touch with your mechanic or a trusted repair shop immediately.

Secondly, contact your local dealer and demand that they take responsibility for this issue. You can also report the problem to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and file a complaint using their online form. Remember that you have the right to demand action from GM, and you should not settle for anything less.

Finally, consider investing in a fire extinguisher for your vehicle, especially if you regularly travel with passengers. While it is not a solution to the problem, it could be a lifesaver in the event of a fire starting due to the fuel pump module issue.

Conclusion

As owners of these vehicles, we have been left in a difficult and dangerous situation by GM's indifference to our safety. However, we cannot continue to ignore this issue or wait for the next recall to come. The safety of ourselves and those around us must come first. Therefore, we urge all owners of 2005-2009 Chevrolet Equinox to take immediate action, and demand that GM take responsibility for this issue before it's too late.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi my 2005 chevy equinox is making like a low rattling noise while idling on park.its kind of annoying i just did an inspectiin and passed. If i hit the gas it goes away but while idling it does it what can it be? Please help other than that the car working wonderful. I had just changed all my mount, oil pan gasket, changed oil, did a tune up changed the breaks and ran it thru diagnostic no codes. Don't know what else to do.

 sounds like you disconnected something and forgot to reattach. Retrace your step as if you were going to perform the work again. I assume you removed the motor mounts to change the oil pan gasket. did you unhook the exhaust? It often has a heat shield of thin metal that might product a ‘rattling’ if not reattached.
