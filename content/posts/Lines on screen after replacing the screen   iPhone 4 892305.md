title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Replaced My iPhone 4 Screen - The Shocking Truth about Lines on the Screen!

How many of us have experienced the panic and annoyance of a cracked phone screen? We've all been in that position where we feel pressured to replace our screen, but wonder if it's worth the money. Recently, I decided to take the plunge and replace my iPhone 4 screen. What I thought would be a simple process turned out to be anything but.

At first, everything seemed fine. I ordered a screen online and followed a tutorial on YouTube to replace it myself. The process was easy enough, and for a few exciting moments, my phone was looking as good as new. However, the joy didn't last long. To my dismay, I noticed a strange horizontal line running across my newly revived screen. 

The line was vibrant, thick, and incredibly distracting. It ran through the middle of the screen and destroyed any hope I had of salvaging my phone. I had to concede that I was going to have to buy a new one.

At first, I couldn't believe it. I thought I had done everything right. I followed the tutorial to the letter, and there were no indications that I'd done anything wrong. I did some research, and it turns out that the dreaded line is a reasonably common issue people experience when attempting a DIY screen replacement.

I learned that the problem was likely related to the LCD panel. When you replace a phone screen yourself, you're removing the LCD and digitizer panel from the previous screen and placing it on the new one. If you don't get the job done correctly, the new panel may not sit flush against the digitizer. Even worse, in some cases, the cable connector may not be seating tightly, causing the line to appear.

I regret not taking my iPhone to a professional for repair, and instead, tried to save money by doing it myself. However, I discovered there's no shortcut to getting your phone fixed. Sometimes the best option is to swallow your pride and take your phone to a professional who can guarantee the job will be done correctly.

In conclusion, if you're ever going to replace your phone screen yourself, make sure you know precisely what you're doing. Follow tutorials carefully, and if anything looks even slightly off, stop what you're doing and seek professional advice. After all, you don't want your phone to end up like mine, broken beyond repair.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi there, I replaced the screen on my iPhone 4 (again) and i started it up and it was perfectly fine, so then I factory reset the phone, I finished setting it back up, after which when I got to the Home Screen, a bunch of lines started showing up on the screen, i then went to settings to see if I could fix it, and the lines went away, but as soon as I went back to the Home Screen the lines came back, it gets really bad in the camera and photos apps. All help would be appreciated!
