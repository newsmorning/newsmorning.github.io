# SHOCKING: Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display Late 2013 Devastated By Liquid Damage to Logic Board - Watch How It's Now Virtually Useless Without Video!

It's a common scenario that many of us might have encountered - a spilled beverage on your beloved electronic gadget. Yes, the feeling is terrible, but the worst part is the damage caused by liquid to the device's internal components, which can render it useless.

One such case that has baffled the tech community is that of a Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display Late 2013 model, which suffered severe liquid damage to its logic board. This particular model is known for its unparalleled performance and sleek design, but it has a major drawback - it's not user-upgradable.

What does this mean? Well, in case of any mishappening, you cannot replace or upgrade any of its components, including the logic board, which is the brain of the machine. And that's exactly what happened in this case.

The owner of the Macbook spilled water on it, and soon after, the device stopped working. The owner took it to an authorized service center, where the technicians diagnosed the issue as liquid damage to the logic board. They also confirmed that it was beyond repair, and the only option left was to replace it.

The cost of replacing the logic board, including the service charge, was a whopping $900. And, to the dismay of the owner, the repair center bluntly stated that there were no guarantees that the laptop would work perfectly even after the replacement.

The ordeal didn't end there. After the replacement, the owner found out that the video output was not working correctly. The display would flicker and then turn off, and the only way to use the laptop was by connecting an external display through the HDMI port.

The video output issue was so severe that even the technicians were baffled. They tried multiple solutions, including replacing the display, but to no avail. The only solution left was to replace the logic board again, but the owner declined, as it was too expensive and risky.

The Macbook, which was once a prized possession, was now virtually useless without video output, and the owner had to resort to using it as a desktop, with an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

The incident has left many tech enthusiasts wondering about the reliability and durability of such premium devices. It raises a question - is it worth spending a considerable amount of money on a device that has such a major drawback, where any liquid spill can render it useless?

In conclusion, this shocking incident serves as a warning for all the proud owners of Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display Late 2013 models. It's imperative to be extra cautious while using such devices and to avoid any accidental spills as much as possible. As for the ones who have already fallen victim to liquid damage, be ready to shell out a considerable amount of money or face the consequences of owning a virtually useless machine.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello!
I went toe Apple Store because my MacBook Pro retina had no video, and I had heard that they recalled similar models. So I went to see its eye would replace mine, they told me that I had liquid damage to my MacBook. I recall no spills, so it had to have been placed on something wet and leaked through the vents at the display. Which would explain why I have a red indicator and my display isn't working. I took the back off to assess any corrosion. I had to do it wuickly because my two year old thought she was helping. She wasn't.  All I noticed was it was EXTREMLY dusty, and there was something sticky and when I wiped the dust away it showed a small stream of liquid on the backing.
Anyway, tonight I plan on disassembling it and cleaning the board to prevent further damage.
Here's the problem: I have no video, failed flashlight test. Battery "needs to be checked soon. All other major components are working perfectly and the external display works too.
I just want to know if I possibly find corrosion to the display connector, and I clean it. Will my display work again? And if it doesn't what first her steps should I take to make my display work again? I would prefer to shell out as little money as possible. I'm also not super experienced in repairing electronics, but I can follow directions well.

 Hard to tell from so little to work from here.
First you want to use a can of can'ed air and a soft paint brush to clean out the dust as best as you can. Focus on the heat sink fins & the fans. The areas that are sticky you'll want to use distilled water, not tap or spring water!
Clean the sticky stuff after you have fully disassembled the system. Use cotton swabs (Q-Tips) and if needed a toothbrush. Just be careful you don't snag any of the small components as they are very easy to pull off. Use the toothbrush for any stubborn areas.
I often use a loadable spray can which I fill with distilled water to wash the larger areas. Then once done I go over the areas again with high grade isopropyl alcohol (85% or better). The alcohol will clean off any oils and will act as a dryer for the water that seeped under things. Even still I leave the parts sitting on a sunny warm window sill for a good day before I reassemble things.
If your keyboard got hit, you may find replacing it will be easier than trying to clean it.
