## Chosen Solution
 What do I do where do i take it

 Hi Jesica Orozco,
Are you asking about the adapter plug or the socket in the laptop, as shown in the images below?
Is it physically broken or is it that it is OK and that the laptop is not charging?
Adapter plug

Laptop socket

(click on image to enlarge for better viewing).
Physically broken
If the plug is broken you need to go to an electronics parts store and get a suitable replacement DC plug and then cut off the old plug and terminate the cable onto the new plug. If this seems too daunting, contact an electronics or laptop repair service and ask for a quote.
If the socket in the laptop is broken, here’s a link to the service manual. Scroll to p.13 to view the necessary pre-requisite steps and then the procedure to replace the power port connector.
Here’s a link to just one supplier of the part. It is only shown to give an idea of the cost of the part. There are other suppliers online that may suit you better. Just search for Dell Chromebook 11 3180 DC Power jack to get results.
Just not charging.
Use a voltmeter to check the DC output from the adapter. It should measure 19.5VDC
If the adapter output is OK, the laptop needs to be opened and the problem further investigated as to the cause.
