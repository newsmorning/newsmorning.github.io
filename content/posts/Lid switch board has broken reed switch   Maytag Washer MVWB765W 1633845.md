Is Your Maytag Washer Making This Vital Mistake? The Lid Switch Board with Broken Reed Switch Explained!

If you have been experiencing difficulty with your Maytag washer, specifically an issue in which the machine does not respond or turn on when you press the Start button, then it is likely that your washer's lid switch board with broken reed switch is the root of the problem.

The lid switch board functions as a security measure that keeps the machine from operating when the lid is open. Usually, the reed switch within the board signals the computer to either allow the machine to run or err on the side of caution and stop the automatic cycle. If the reed switch within the lid board becomes damaged or fails, it creates the perfect opportunity for errors to occur.

Luckily, identifying, replacing, and fixing a broken reed switch within the lid switch board is a relatively quick and effortless process. To identify the issue, you can use a multimeter to inspect the lid switch board and check for continuity. Without opening the washing machine, it's not possible to inspect the switch directly, but a simple test with a multimeter that reads the resistance can determine if it is functional or not.

Once you've found that the reed switch is damaged or malfunctioning, it's recommended that you replace it with an authentic Maytag washer part to guarantee long-term durability and avoid any potential issues. It's possible to replace the reed switch on the lid switch board yourself if you feel comfortable with DIY projects, but if you are not confident in your ability to configure the new switch, it's best to enlist the help of a professional.

If your Maytag washer is making this vital mistake of not responding when you try to start it, it's likely that the lid switch board with the broken reed switch is to blame. Luckily, fixing this issue is a simple process that could save you money and more considerable repairs down the road. By taking the time to correctly identify and replace the affected component, you'll have your washing machine up and running smoothly in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 After all of the helpful info on this site I downloaded the service manual, printed it up and worked through all the steps.  Got weird values when testing per the manual but didn't get error indicator on control board so I dug a little deeper into the ridiculous latch/switch.  I knew there is a magnet on the lid so there had to be a reed switch, using a magnifier I found it and saw it was cracked.  It's tiny.  Not sure if it's NO or NC or if there are polarity considerations etc... so I'll probably just buy a new switch.  But if anyone has any experience replacing the reed switch I'd love to hear it.
Thanks to all who contribute here!

 Hi,
The tech sheet for the washer shows that the lid switch is a N.O. contact i.e. closes when operated. (see p.22 for the wiring diagram).
Polarity shouldn't be an issue if there is a magnet to operate it. Like most metals, the moving contact  in the switch will be attracted to the bar magnet when it is close enough to influence it and makes a connection with the other contact, closing the circuit.
Finding the correct replacement is one thing, the other is replacing it.
Once you remove the reed switch, you can measure its dimensions and then the datasheets associated with each reed switch will give the specifications which should help to find a compatible replacement that will fit.
I've never replaced one in a washer so I'm sorry I can't help you with that.

 In order to test the switch, get your multimeter out and set to ohms or continuity. Your going to test across the switch with nothing activating it FIRST, then ACTIVATED. All you need to see is the switch change states then you will both know if it's NO/NC and if the switch works.
NO = OL to Ohms (or beep)
NC = ohms (or beep) to OL
