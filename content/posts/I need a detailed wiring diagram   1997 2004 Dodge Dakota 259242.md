## Chosen Solution
 I was wondering does anyone have or know how to get a hold of a detailed easy to see diagram of the wiring harness for this 1997 Dodge Dakota truck?  The specified area would be from under the dashboard to the heater core and back.  Would really appreciate this info.

 Get a Haynes manual. I am swapping the harness from a 00 to a 98 converting manual locks and windows to power and the schematics in the manual are great costs about 25
