Is Your Computer Slowly Killing You? 7 Shocking Health Issues Revealed (And How To Stay Safe)

In our modern world, computers have become an essential part of our lives. However, research has revealed that long hours of sitting in front of a computer can have serious negative consequences on our health.

Here are 7 shocking health issues commonly caused by prolonged computer usage:

1. Eye Strain and Dry Eyes

When staring at the computer screen for prolonged periods, we tend to blink less often than we should, which can lead to dry eyes and eye strain. To avoid this, try to follow the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away.

2. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome occurs when we use our computer mouse or keyboard for an extended period, leading to a numbness or tingling sensation in the arms, hands or fingers. To prevent this, keep your hands and wrists in a neutral position while typing and use a wrist pad if necessary.

3. Poor Posture

Sitting in front of a computer for long periods of time can lead to poor posture, which can result in back and neck pain. To avoid this, ensure your computer is positioned at eye level, and sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor.

4. Obesity

Sitting for extended periods can lead to weight gain, which, in turn, increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes and other health issues. To prevent this, take regular breaks and walk around, stretch or perform simple exercises.

5. Headaches

Frequent computer use can cause headaches, which are often caused by computer glare, poor lighting, and tension around the neck and shoulders. To avoid this, adjust your screen settings to reduce glare and take quick breaks to stretch your neck and shoulders.

6. Insomnia

Late-night computer usage can disrupt your sleep patterns, leading to insomnia, fatigue and poor concentration. To prevent this, switch off your computer at least one hour before bedtime, and avoid using it in bed.

7. Cancer

There are concerns that prolonged computer usage may be linked to certain types of cancer, such as leukemia and lymphoma. While this has yet to be definitively proven, it's important to take precautions and limit your exposure to computer radiation by reducing screen brightness and using anti-glare screens.

To stay safe and prevent these health issues, it's important to take frequent breaks and exercise regularly. Also, consider investing in ergonomic equipment, such as a comfortable chair, a standing desk, and a hands-free headset.

In summary, while computer use has become an essential part of our modern lifestyle, it's important to take steps to protect our health by taking regular breaks, exercising, and investing in ergonomic equipment. By doing so, you can continue to enjoy the benefits of the digital world without putting your health at risk.

Constant use of anything is going to lead to
problems. Computers are no different, and it could be argued that humans spend
more time on them, including smartphones, than anything else we do. Except
maybe sleeping. This can cause, or make worse, some serious medical conditions.
 
We’re going to first look at the health issues
that can be caused or exacerbated by computer use, and at the end we’ll look at
what you can do to keep these things from happening. Or at least minimize them.
 
## Migraines and Headaches
 
There are headaches and then there are
migraine headaches. Excessive staring at a screen can contribute to the
severity and frequency of both. Your eyes are literally brain stalks that have
the ends exposed to the world. So everything you do with your eyes directly
affects your brain.
 

 
Staring at a bright light is bound to cause strain, leading to pain, and eventually a headache. For people who are already prone to migraines, excessive screen time can make them more frequent and worse. As Scott Tousley writes in his article, “The 60-Second Trick to Stop Headaches From Computer Screens at Night” this kind of strain, “…occurs in 50% to 90% of computer workers.”
 
## Vertigo
 
Being a little dizzy sounds funny, but vertigo is a serious issue. Imagine feeling like you’re going to fall over all the time. And sometimes you do. Vertigo is closely related to migraines. So if excessive screen time can cause migraines, it can certainly trigger or worsen vertigo.
 
Every computer screen has a flicker. Generally
you don’t recognize it, but that does not mean you don’t see it. It still
registers on your brain. That constant flickering can also cause or complicate
vertigo.
 
## Macular Degeneration
 
Imagine that there’s a darkened or blacked-out circle in the middle of everything you look at. That’s what macular degeneration does. This can happen just through aging and it affects more people than cataracts and glaucoma. But High Energy Visible-light (HEV) plays a factor. 
 
Like how staring at the sun is a bad idea. You’ve also heard HEV called ‘blue light’. Of course, computer screens are a source of HEV, often less than two feet from your eyes.
 
The jury still seems to be out on this, though. Doctor of Optometry, Marc Grossman, OD, LAc. says, “HEV is a known risk factor in causing macular degeneration.”, so he seems to be saying it could happen. 
 
Stephen Rose, of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, says, “There is no evidence that sitting at a computer screen has any effect on the development of age-related macular degeneration or any other retinal problems.” Either way, why take the chance?
 
## Depression and Anxiety
 
Excessive computer use doesn’t cause depression and anxiety but it can make it worse for many reasons. We know that exercise, good nutrition, fresh air and sunshine are powerful aides in dealing with depression and anxiety. 
 
Sitting in a dark room, staring at a screen and eating junk food is the exact opposite of that. And that’s what a lot of people do every day, whether it’s gaming or just keeping up with what the rest of the world is doing while you do nothing.
 
Add to that the headaches, migraines, vertigo
and other potential health issues and the depression and anxiety can only get
worse. Plus the things that you see and hear will affect you. You’re seeing
what people in the world want you to see. You’re seeing the brief moments where
they are at their best. Then you look around you and feel like you’re not
measuring up. Comparison is the thief of joy, as the saying goes.
 
On the other hand, there are video games designed to help people with depression and anxiety. So, like any other tool, computers can be used to fix problems or, if misused, really destroy things.
 
## Tics, Epilepsy, and Tourette
Syndrome
 
Tics and epilepsy aren’t conditions that are
caused by computers, but they can be exacerbated by them. Tics are often
related to Tourette’s Syndrome, so if excessive computer use can trigger tics
it can also negatively affect people living with Tourette’s Syndrome. 
 
It’s also common knowledge that flickering
lights can trigger epileptic seizures. Computer screens flicker constantly.
It’s a part of how they work.
 
In an article from the Tourette Syndrome Parents, their top recommendation to help reduce the symptoms of Tourette’s is less screen time. It’s that simple.
 
## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
 
As the name suggests, there’s a tunnel in your
wrist. Through that tunnel travels the median nerve. If anything should happen
to narrow the tunnel, it impinges on the median nerve causing pain, numbness,
and mobility problems in the hand and arm. This could result in permanent
damage and loss of function in the hand.
 
The way most of us use computers can create the ideal conditions for inflammation around the carpal tunnel. Obesity can also increase the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome. There’s that inactivity from being on a computer all day coming in to play again.
 
## Chronic Neck and Back Pain
 
We talked about being hunched over causing
headaches before. That hunching can lead to poor posture and a host of neck and
back pain problems. 
 
Smartphone use also contributes to this.
Instead of lifting the phone up to eye level, people hunch over and look at the
phone as they hold it somewhere around their waist. Keep that up and you’re
going to look like a question mark, plus be in constant pain.
 
## The Prevention and Possibly the
Cure
 
It’s painfully obvious what the top
preventative measure is, isn’t it? Use computers and smartphones less. 
 
For screen-related issues, try lowering the brightness to match the brightness levels of the world around you. A reduction in the contrast between your screen and your surroundings can reduce eye strain dramatically. It also reduces the intensity of HEV or blue light that you’re exposed to. Consider using an app to help reduce blue light too, or calibrate your monitor.
 
For vertigo, flicker headaches, and epilepsy, try changing the refresh rate on your monitor. Most default to 60Hz, which is also the same frequency that fluorescent bulbs use. So if you’re working on a computer in a room with fluorescent lighting, that’s a double whammy. Get your monitor on a different frequency and it should help.
 
For carpal tunnel and other muscle and soft tissue issues, get your workstation, or battle station, set up to cause you the least repetitive strain injury (RSI) damage. Look at getting an ergonomic keyboard or vertical mouse to relieve wrist strain. And also get up and move. 
 
If that means taking a 5 minute break at the
office every hour to get up and walk around, then do that. Do some stretches.
If it means scheduling your gaming so that you don’t get sucked into playing
for 24 hours straight, do that. If it means putting your phone on silent and in
your pocket while you lift your head and look at the world, do that.
