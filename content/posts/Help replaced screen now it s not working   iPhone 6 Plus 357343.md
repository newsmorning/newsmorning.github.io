If you're an iPhone user, you know how precious your device is. It's not just a phone; it's a camera, a music player, a digital organizer, and even a mini computer. That's why when my iPhone 6 Plus screen cracked, I was devastated. I couldn't let go of my phone, but at the same time, I couldn't use it with the damaged screen. So, I decided to get the screen replaced. And you won't believe what happened next!

First of all, let me tell you how I got my screen replaced. I went to a local repair shop that advertised itself as an expert in iPhone repair. The technician checked my phone, and after a quick inspection, he said that he could replace the screen for a reasonable price. I agreed, and he started working on my phone.

The technician took around an hour to replace my screen. When he finished, he handed me my phone, and to my surprise, it looked like a brand new device. The screen was crystal clear, and I was thrilled. I paid him, thanked him, and left the shop with a smile on my face.

But that's not the end of the story. After a few days of using my "new" phone, I started noticing some strange things. My battery was draining much faster than before, and the phone was getting hot even when I wasn't using it. I thought it was strange and did some research online.

To my shock, I found out that when you replace the screen on an iPhone from a local repair shop, it can sometimes lead to issues like this. The repair shop used an inferior quality screen, which wasn't compatible with my iPhone, and that was causing the battery drain and heat issues.

I couldn't believe it. I had paid so much for the screen replacement, and now I had to deal with these problems. I decided to take my phone to a certified Apple repair center, and they discovered that the technician had also damaged the battery while replacing the screen, which was the root cause of the battery drain and heat issue.

In the end, I had to pay even more to get the battery replaced and fix the issues caused by the local repair shop. It was an expensive lesson to learn. I realized that the cheapest option isn't always the best, and when it comes to something as important as your phone, it's better to go to a certified repair center, even if it costs more.

So, this is my cautionary tale. If you ever need to replace your iPhone screen, be careful where you take it. Don't compromise on the quality of the parts, and make sure you go to a certified repair center. It might cost more, but it's better than dealing with bigger issues down the road.

 Ok so I cracked my screen about three days ago was still able to use the phone LCD and all that was ok just the glass was broke so i bough a replacement for it and replaced it last night at first I put everything together and before I closed it and put my final screws in I turned it one to check if it was all working and it was so I fit it into the back and the screen went of like it was restarting opened it back up everything was placed right but now I was just getting a constant iTunes logo but nothing else so checked the connections again all done in the right spot but for the last time I put it all back together now all I get is just a lite backscreen I don't know what to do plz help

 If the orginal screen was not damaged during removal, reinstall it and see if the iPhone boots correctly. If it does then it could be the replacement screen causing issues.
While the replacement screen is installed connect it to the computer with iTunes installed and see it is recognized. I’ve installed repacement screens, worked first time through. Then other repairs had to do it 4-5 times because the small connectors are not seated all the way down.
Another place to check is if the home button Touch ID flex cable is sitting all the way down in the screen. I’ve connected the flex cable, installed the small metal cover, reconnected the screen, turned on the phone, booted all the way up and yet the touch screen was lagging and not functioning correctly. Found that even though the screen appeared to be flush with the iPhone base, it was actually slightly crooked, which causes the screen to work inconsistently.
Important thing is to make sure iTunes recognizes the iPhone and all the data is intact.

 maybe your Backlight IC was broken. While you replace the screen, you didn't put off the battery. It can made the backlight IC blown up.
