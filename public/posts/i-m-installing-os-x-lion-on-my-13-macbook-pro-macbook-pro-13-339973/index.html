Whether you are a digital creative, a software engineer, or an everyday user, upgrading to OS X Lion can take your Mac experience to a whole new level.\nIn this article, I will share my experience of installing the OS X Lion on my 13\" MacBook Pro, and the mind-blowing results it brought to my Apple experience.\nBefore diving into the installation process, let’s take a brief look at what OS X Lion offers.\nOS X Lion is the eighth major release of the Mac OS X operating system. It was released in 2011 and introduced a set of features that changed the way people use Macs. Some of the most notable features include the Launchpad, Mission Control, AirDrop, and Auto Save.\nThe Launchpad offers a simple yet efficient way to access all your applications. Mission Control provides a bird’s eye view of all your open windows, making it easy to switch between them. AirDrop allows for easy file transfer between Macs, and Auto Save ensures that your work is saved automatically in real-time.\nNow, let’s get to the installation process. The OS X Lion installation process is straightforward and can be done in a few easy steps.\nFirstly, ensure that your MacBook Pro meets the OS X Lion system requirements. These requirements include having at least 2GB of RAM, 7GB of free space on your hard disk, and running Mac OS X Snow Leopard or later.\nOnce you’ve confirmed that your MacBook Pro meets the requirements, launch the Mac App Store and search for OS X Lion. Purchase and download the OS X Lion installer.\nNext, create a backup of your existing data on your MacBook Pro. This step is essential in case any data is lost or deleted during the installation process.\nAfter making a backup, double click on the downloaded file to open the installer. Follow the on-screen prompts, select your MacBook Pro’s hard disk, and click “Install.”\nThe installation process may take some time, but once it’s complete, you’ll be able to reap the benefits of OS X Lion.\nThe jaw-dropping results of installing OS X Lion on my MacBook Pro include faster performance, enhanced responsiveness, and remarkable stability. The Launchpad and Mission Control have made it easy to access and switch between applications and windows without cluttering my desktop.\nAirDrop has been beneficial in sending and receiving files from other Macs, while Auto Save has saved me from losing my work by always keeping my documents up to date.\nIn conclusion, upgrading to OS X Lion is a revolutionary hack that will take your MacBook Pro experience to new heights. With better performance, faster response times, and added functionality, installing OS X Lion is a must for any MacBook Pro user.\nChosen Solution Hello, I’m installing OS -X Lion on my 13” MacBook Pro, but it stuck at “downloading additional components” and it says 46 hours left. It’s already more then 7 hours that I’m waiting and I don’t think it s normal. There is also the little circle running since yesterday night … what should I do? Reinstall the OS again? thanks\nOften the issue is a poor internet connection so the installation fails. But you have a second issue here which makes this even harder! Apple uses a certificate within the installer which the installer uses to validate it before it tries to install. It uses a date window and will fail when the systems date is outside of the window! Here’s a good writeup on this If you’ve got an old macOS install image, it will probably stop working today \u0026 How to get an old macOS installer from Apple. Apple doesn’t update the older OS’s certificates any more. So you either need to get an updated OS installer (new certificate) if you can use a newer OS or you need to fake-out the installer making it think its back in time! You still need the OS installer on a local bootable drive so make sure you’ve done that. Then disconnect your Mac from the internet and alter your systems data as outlined here:\nRun the installer and you should be set!\n","wordCount":"741","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dennis Wright"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/i-m-installing-os-x-lion-on-my-13-macbook-pro-macbook-pro-13-339973/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary Hack: See the Jaw-Dropping Results as I Install OS X Lion on My 13 MacBook Pro!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 6, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;741 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Dennis Wright</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: Revolutionary Hack: See the Jaw-Dropping Results as I Install OS X Lion on My 13" MacBook Pro!</p><p>If you are still using an old version of Mac OS X, you are missing out on some fantastic features, new functionalities, and some jaw-dropping capabilities that come with the OS X Lion.
