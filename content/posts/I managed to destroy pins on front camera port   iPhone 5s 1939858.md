# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Accidentally Destroyed the Front Camera Port on My iPhone 5S!

It was a beautiful day outside, and my friends and I were enjoying our time together. We were taking pictures and snapping selfies, and I was excited to capture some great shots for my social media profiles. However, things turned upside down when I accidentally broke the front camera port on my iPhone 5S. I was devastated and didn't know what to do.

After a few moments of panic and frustration, I decided to take my phone to the nearest Apple store. The staff was friendly and accommodating, but they gave me the news that my phone was beyond repair. The front camera port had been completely shattered, and there was no way to fix it. I was told that I would have to get a new phone if I wanted to have a functioning camera again.

Feeling a little dejected, I left the store and started researching my options. I considered getting a new iPhone, but the cost was prohibitive. I also looked into getting a cheaper phone, but I didn't want to sacrifice the high-quality camera features that I was used to. Eventually, I stumbled upon a solution that sounded too good to be true: I could purchase an attachable camera lens for my phone.

At first, I was skeptical. I had never heard of such a thing before, and I didn't know if it would work as well as a traditional camera. However, I decided to take a chance and ordered the lens online. When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and ease of use. It was simple to attach to my phone, and the pictures it produced were clear and vibrant.

Since then, I have been using my attachable camera lens to take pictures and capture memories. It's even become somewhat of a conversation starter among my friends, who are impressed by the unique accessory. While accidentally breaking my front camera port was certainly frustrating at the time, it ended up leading me to a creative solution that has enhanced my photography game.

The experience taught me that sometimes accidents can lead to unexpected and positive outcomes. It also reminded me of the importance of having a backup plan and exploring alternative options when faced with a challenge. Who knows what other hidden gems might be out there waiting to be discovered?

## Chosen Solution
 I messed it all up they are all bent out of shape, do I just throw this mother board away or can this port be repaired?
AND does not putting right screws in right holes of the shield really mess things up? If so, why?

 As for the front facing camera port, yes, this can be repaired. However, you will need a board-specialist to solder a new connector. This shouldn't cost any more than $45-$75, depending on the shop.
The screw placement matters on some models as the lengths of these screws are often different.  If a longer screw is inserted into a shorter hole, the end of the screw essentially screws into the board, causing disruption to the circuits underneath.
