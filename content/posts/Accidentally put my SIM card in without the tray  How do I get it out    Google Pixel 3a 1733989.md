Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Put My Sim Card In Without The Tray! Find Out How I Got It Out on Google Pixel 3A!

Have you ever made a mistake of putting your sim card in without the tray? You are not alone; many of us have faced the same trouble, and if it happens to be with Google Pixel 3A, you may feel frustrated. But don't worry; I have got your back. Let me tell you how I got the sim card out without any damage to my phone.

Step 1: Take a deep breath and don't panic.

The first thing you need to do is don't panic. I can understand the situation could be frustrating, but you need to stay calm and composed while dealing with the issue. Panicking will only make things worse, so take a deep breath and relax.

Step 2: Turn off your Google Pixel 3A.

Once you are calm, turn off your phone. Press and hold the power button until the power off option appears on the screen. Tap on the power off option to turn off your phone.

Step 3: Prepare your tools.

Before we can proceed, we need a few tools that will help us in getting the sim card out of the phone. You will need a paper clip, a needle, or a SIM ejector tool. If you don't have any of these, don't worry. You can use a toothpick as well.

Step 4: Locate the Sim Card Slot.

The Sim card slot on your Google Pixel 3A is located on the left side of the phone. You will see a small hole near the volume buttons. This is the Sim card slot.

Step 5: Insert the tool.

Now insert the paper clip, needle, SIM ejector tool, or toothpick into the hole and push it gently until the Sim card tray pops out.

Step 6: Remove the Sim Card.

Once the Sim card tray is visible, use your fingers to remove the Sim card. Be careful while doing this and avoid applying too much pressure.

Step 7: Put back the Sim tray.

After you have removed the Sim card, put back the tray carefully into the Sim card slot. Make sure it clicks into the right place.

Step 8: Turn on your phone.

Once you have put back the Sim tray, turn on your Google Pixel 3A by pressing and holding the power button. Wait for a few seconds until the phone boots up.

Conclusion:

Putting the sim card in without the tray can be a frustrating situation, but with the right tools and approach, it's not that big of a deal. I hope this guide has been helpful to you, and you were able to retrieve your Sim card without any damage to your phone. Remember, the key is to stay calm and composed during the process.

## Chosen Solution
 This is my first phone, so I stupidly wasn’t careful with the insertion of the SIM card. I couldn’t figure out how to put the bigger SIM card in the tray after a few seconds of inspection, and instead just pushed it in by itself. Now it’s stuck and I immediately regretted my decision.
Is there any good way to get it out from the outside, and if not, how easy would it be to open the phone up and get it out from inside?

 Get a small sewing needle wrap the dull end in tape (masking, duct, etc.) then  heat up the sharp tip with a lighter.  Now shove the needle as deep as you can into the sim card. Wait for it to cool then pull the needle and sim card out together.
