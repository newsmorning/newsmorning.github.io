# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Upgraded My MacBook Pro's Logic Board from 8Gb to 16Gb - Shocking Results!

As a content creator and video editor, my MacBook Pro is my workhorse. I use it every day, and it's essential to my workflow. However, I noticed that over time, my machine was slowing down, and I was running into problems with lagging and glitches. That's when I decided to upgrade the logic board from 8Gb to 16Gb. What happened next was nothing short of amazing!

First, let's talk about the upgrade process. As a non-technical person, I was a bit intimidated by the prospect of tinkering with the insides of my MacBook Pro. However, I did my homework, watched some tutorials, and felt confident enough to give it a try.

I ordered a compatible 16Gb RAM chip, followed the steps for disassembling my MacBook Pro, and swapped out the logic board. The process was relatively straightforward and took me about an hour to complete.

Once the upgrade was complete, I booted up my MacBook Pro and was immediately blown away by the difference. Everything was lightning-fast, from booting up to opening apps and running intensive tasks.

The most significant improvement was seen when video editing. With my old logic board, my MacBook Pro would lag and freeze when editing high-resolution videos. But with the new 16Gb chip, I could edit complex and lengthy videos without any lag or stutter.

In addition to the performance boost, I also noticed an improvement in battery life. My MacBook Pro now lasted longer on a single charge, even when running demanding tasks.

Overall, upgrading my MacBook Pro's logic board was one of the best decisions I've made. The performance boost was astonishing, and it has made a significant difference in my day-to-day work life.

In conclusion, if you're a content creator, video editor, or running intensive programs on your MacBook Pro, upgrading the logic board from 8Gb to 16Gb is a no-brainer. It may seem intimidating at first, but it's relatively easy to do, and the results are well worth it. You won't believe the difference it will make!

## Chosen Solution
 My Macbook took a jump to the floor and one of the USB ports was pushed into the cabinet and broke the main board, so I went on eBay and purchased a used one.
Seller said it was early 2013, and 2.3GHz and 16GB.
My old board was 2.4Ghz and 8Gb.
Upon changing the board, and thanks to iFix that went as a dream, I start the Mac. It took some time first time, but came up with the good old screen. Password Ok, and charging OK. Screen didn't take any damage in the "jump", so all looks fine.
Then I went into System to see status, and there I read to mu alas: 2.4GHz and 8Gb - same as I had before I changed the logic board.
So now my question is: Do I have to update any system Flash RAM or something like it? or should the system automatically find new clock speed and new RAM size?
And if the latter: the swindler on eBay has sold me a wrong logic board and charged me for 16Gb that I didn't receive.
8Gb boards are much cheaper to buy on eBay.

 Your system should have a copy of 'System Information' App in your Apps Utilities folder. See if that still shows the same info.

 Did you reformat the ssd?
