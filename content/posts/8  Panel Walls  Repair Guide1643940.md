Introduction

Cracked and damaged walls are a common problem faced by property owners. It not only makes the building appear unsightly but also affects the overall structural integrity. However, with the right tools and expertise, repairing these walls can be an easy task. In this article, we will be presenting an 8-step guide on how to repair cracked and damaged walls.

Step 1: Analyze the Damage

Before you start repairing the wall, it is essential to analyze the level of damage. You can use a scraper to check the extent of damage to the wall. If the damage is extensive, it might require professional assistance. However, for small cracks and damages, you can use this guide.

Step 2: Clean the Area

To get the best results, you need to ensure that the wall is clean and free of debris. Start by using a wire brush to remove the loose debris and dust in the cracks. After this, use a damp cloth to clean the wall and let it dry.

Step 3: Apply Filler

Filler is a material used to fill gaps and holes in walls. It is available in various forms such as powder, paste or pre-mixed. Apply the filler to the cracks and holes in the wall using a putty knife. It is crucial to ensure that you fill the cracks and holes completely. After applying the filler, let it dry for the recommended time.

Step 4: Sand the Filled Area

Once the filler has dried, use a sandpaper to smoothen the filled area. You can use fine-grit sandpaper to remove any excess filler and make the area smooth. Wipe the area clean with a damp cloth after sanding.

Step 5: Apply Primer

Applying primer is an essential step in wall repair. It prepares the wall for painting or wallpaper. Cover the repaired area with a primer using a paintbrush or roller. Be sure to let the primer dry completely before applying paint or wallpaper.

Step 6: Paint the Wall

If you plan to paint the wall after repair, choose a paint color that matches the existing wall. Use a paintbrush or roller to paint the repaired area. Allow the paint to dry as per the manufacturer's instructions.

Step 7: Wallpaper the Wall

If you prefer to use wallpaper, select a pattern that matches the existing wallpaper or complements the wall color. Measure and cut the wallpaper to fit the repaired area. Apply wallpaper paste to the back of the wallpaper and carefully stick it to the wall.

Step 8: Finishing Touches

After the repaired area is painted or wallpapered, it is time for the finishing touches. If you are painting, apply a second coat of paint to give the wall a uniform look. If you are wallpapering, use a seam roller to ensure the wallpaper is evenly applied and smooth. This step will give the repaired area a polished finish.

Conclusion

Repairing cracked and damaged walls can be an easy task if you follow the right steps. By analyzing the damage, cleaning the area, applying filler, sanding, applying primer, painting or wallpapering, and adding finishing touches, you can restore your wall to its former glory. Invest time and effort into repairing your walls, and you will have a beautiful and durable wall that lasts for years to come.

## Introduction
 
Itâ€™s wise to wait until everything is connected and works correctly before installing the remaining panels.
 
There kit does contain a back panel to fully enclose the printer. Because there is no active cooling on the board I decided to leave it off for now. The installation is the same for the other panels.
 
Printed parts needed:
 
None
 
## What you need

Step 1

                  Electronics/Back Panel               


 
- 
 - Peel the white protective film off both sides of the panel walls.
 - 
 - Using 10x M3x8 countersunk screws and 10x M3 T-nuts install the back panel on the inside 2020 extrusion
 - 
 - Pay attention to the screw holes on the panel. They aren't labeled.

Step 2

                  Bottom Panel               


 
- 
 - Remove the protective film from both sides of the panel.
 - 
 - Take 4x 8mm brass standoffs and secure them to the underside of the front half of the bottom panel with 4x M3x6 button head screws.(opposite side of the countersunk holes)
 - 
 - Screw the BLV NeoPixel board to the front half of the bottom panel using 4x M3x6 button head screws. The reset button faces the cutouts for the wires(towards the front of the printer)
 - 
 - Connect the black/white 2 wire cable to the transmission port. Connect the red/black power wires to the power input.
 - 
 - Screw on 12x M3x8 countersunk screws and 12x M3 T-nuts onto the front and back half of the bottom panel.
 - 
 - Drop the 2 halves of the bottom panel into the frame with the T-nuts dropping into the channel.
 - 
 - Once you have equal spacing tighten the M3x8 countersunk screws
