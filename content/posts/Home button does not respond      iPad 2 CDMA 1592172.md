Is Your iPad 2 CDMA Broken? Find Out Why Your Home Button Isn't Responding!

As an iPad user, one of the essential parts of the device is the home button. It's responsible for taking you back to the home screen, activating Siri or using Apple Pay. When your home button isn't responding, it can be frustrating, and you may feel like your device is broken. However, before you throw in the towel or send it in for repairs, you should first try to understand why the home button isn't working.

One of the most common causes of the home button not responding on an iPad 2 CDMA is a software glitch. To fix it, try restarting your device or resetting it to factory settings. Restarting your device clears temporary memory and removes any app that may have crashed, resolving any software-related issues. Factory resetting your device is a more aggressive solution that erases all content and settings, but it may be necessary if the software issue persists.

Another issue that could lead to a non-responsive home button is a hardware issue. It may occur if the home button isn't attached correctly, damaged or dirt has accumulated around it. In such cases, you may need to replace the home button as a DIY project or have it replaced professionally. Keep in mind that DIY replacement may void your device warranty.

If you've ruled out both software and hardware-related issues, the cause of the problem may be the touch ID sensor. In newer models, such as the iPad Air and the iPad 5th generation, the home button includes a touch ID sensor, which is responsible for reading fingerprints to unlock the device. If you're using an iPad 2 CDMA, you don't have this feature, but the touch ID sensor's malfunction can still affect the button's functionality. In this case, you may have to contact Apple support or an authorized repair center to fix the issue.

In conclusion, before you jump to conclusions that your iPad 2 CDMA is broken, take your time to troubleshoot the home button issue. The problem may be related to the software, hardware, or touch ID sensor. By following the guide above or by contacting an authorized repair center, you can get your device up and running in no time. Remember to always backup your data before performing any significant troubleshooting steps to avoid permanent loss of data.

## Chosen Solution
 I re-installed digitizer screen and now home button does not respond.

 You have damaged home flat, not rare damage in the process of digitizer replacement. Replace it and it will work. Good luck.
