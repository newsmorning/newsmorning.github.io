I recently cracked the screen of my iPhone 8 Plus, and as a result, I found myself in the market for a screen replacement. I opted to do it myself since it seemed like it would be cheaper and faster than going to a repair shop. 

To fix the screen, I ordered a replacement screen online and followed a tutorial video. It took a few hours, but I finally got it done. However, when I turned on my phone, I realized that there was one major problem - my home button no longer worked. 

At first, I was pretty upset about this. I depend on my home button to navigate my phone quickly, and I wasn't sure I wanted to deal with a phone that didn't have it. But as I started to get used to the new way of using my phone, I realized that there were actually some benefits to not having a home button. 

For one, I was forced to use the swipe-up gesture to open my home screen. This gesture had always been an option, but I had never really used it since the home button was always there. But now that it was gone, I found myself swiping up more and more often. 

As I got used to the new gesture, I also started to use the app switcher more often. With the home button, I would always double-tap it to bring up the app switcher, but now I had to swipe up and hold my finger in the middle of the screen. This was a little awkward at first, but I quickly got the hang of it. 

Another benefit of not having a home button was that I could use my phone with one hand more easily. With the home button, I would always have to stretch my thumb down to the bottom of the screen, but now I could swipe up from anywhere on the bottom of the screen to get to my home screen. This made it much more comfortable to use my phone for extended periods of time. 

Overall, I was surprised by how much I didn't miss the home button. In fact, I found myself wondering why I had never used the swipe-up gesture before. It was just as fast (if not faster) than the home button, and it made using my phone with one hand much easier. 

In conclusion, while I was initially frustrated by the loss of my home button, I found that it actually opened up some new possibilities for how I could use my phone. If you're ever in a situation where you need to replace your phone screen and end up without a home button, don't panic - you might find that it's not so bad after all.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced a screen on an iPhone 8+ today and when I put back the home button from the previous “original” screen on the new replacement screen the home button (touch iD) was not working. I have the phone on “assistance touch” right now but I want to know why this is happening and the home button is not responding when I’m using the original button from the original screen the phone came with.

 Either the home button has gone bad or the replacement screen has a bad home button connector which means you’ll need to try another screen to find out.
