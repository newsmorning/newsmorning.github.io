# Get Ready to Unleash a Fortune! Check out these Exclusive Items You'll Unlock in Apex Legends Fortune's Favor Battle Pass!

Apex Legends has been making waves ever since its launch, with its unique gameplay mechanics, stunning graphics, and an ever-growing roster of characters. However, one of the biggest reasons why players keep coming back to the game is the Battle Pass. With each new season, the Battle Pass introduces a plethora of exciting new items, skins, and challenges, that keep the game fresh and exciting. And the just-released Season 9 Battle Pass, Fortune's Favor, is no exception.

Fortune's Favor brings with it a host of new content, including a new legend, weapon, and most importantly, a brand new Battle Pass filled with exclusive items, skins, and charms. In this article, we'll take a closer look at some of the most exciting items you can unlock in the new Battle Pass.

## New Legend and Weapon Skins

One of the most exciting additions to the Battle Pass is the new Legend, Valkyrie. As a new addition to the roster, players will be eager to get their hands on some exclusive skins for her. And Fortune's Favor Battle Pass does not disappoint. Players can unlock six exclusive skins for Valkyrie, each with its unique design and color scheme. From the fiery red "Thrill of the Hunt" skin to the sleek "Black and Gold" skin, there is a skin for every Valkyrie player out there.

But Valkyrie isn't the only one getting new skins. The Battle Pass also introduces two weapon skins, one for the G7 Scout and one for the Mastiff. The "Solar Flare" G7 Scout skin is a vibrant and colorful take on the weapon, while the "Vlad the Impaler" Mastiff skin is a sinister-looking skin that is sure to strike fear into your opponents.

## Charms and Loading Screens

While skins are always the highlight of the Battle Pass, there are some other exciting items for players to unlock as well. This season, players can earn up to five new charms, each with its unique design. From the adorable "Chihuahua" charm to the menacing "Dragon" charm, there is something for everyone.

Players can also unlock four new loading screens, each showcasing a different legend and their unique abilities. These loading screens not only look stunning, but they also make for a great way to show off your favorite legends.
