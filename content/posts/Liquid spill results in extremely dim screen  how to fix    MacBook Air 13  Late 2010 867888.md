## Introduction
Macbook Air is one of the most popular laptops in the world. It is a high-performance computer that is designed for those who want a sleek and powerful device that allows them to work on the go. Unfortunately, accidents happen, and Macbook screens can easily be damaged by a liquid spill. In this article, we will discuss what to do if you spill liquid on your Macbook Air screen â€“ and how to fix it.

## Step 1: Dry The Screen
The first step is to dry the screen as soon as possible. Use a microfiber cloth or any absorbent material to immediately soak up the liquid from the screen. Remove any excess liquid by wiping the screen gently but thoroughly. You can also turn off your Macbook immediately and unplug it to avoid any damage to the internal components.

## Step 2: Check For Damages
Check for damages after drying the screen. After drying the screen, check for any damages such as cracks or physical deformities. Look out for the extent of the spillage and if it has entered the internal components of your Macbook. If your Macbook has been completely submerged, take it directly to an authorized Macbook service center.

## Step 3: Use Screen Cleaning Products
If you observe any smudging or staining on the screen, use a screen cleaning product. Many cleaning products are available on the market that are specially designed for use on electronic screens. If the screen has been damaged by water, a cleaning product can help remove any remaining watermarks or stains.

## Step 4: Replace The Screen
If the spill has caused severe damage to the screen, such as cracks or discoloration, you may need to replace the screen. Replacing the screen can be a tricky process, but it can be done at an authorized Macbook service center.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while it is possible to fix a liquid spill on a Macbook Air screen, prevention is always better than cure. Always keep liquids such as water, coffee, and other beverages far away from your laptop. If the worst has happened and you have spilled liquid on your Macbook Air screen, dry it immediately, use a screen cleaning product if necessary, and if your screen has been severely damaged by the spill, take it to an authorized Macbook service center to replace the screen. We hope that this guide has been helpful to you.

## Chosen Solution
 Someone spilled tea on it and saw the screen short out. After using Windex to clean up the logic board almost everything works, memory, power, etc. except that the screen is so dim I need to use a flashlight to see it. Output to external monitor is just fine. Can this dim screen output be fixed?
Repair shop tried soldering something on the logic board they thought would affect screen brightness but to no avail. They said that the controller for screen brightness was not working, not sending the correct voltage out to make the screen brighter.
I can press every key on the keyboard and they all work, but the screen brightness keys (although showing the brightness icon and filling more bars as I press longer) do not affect screen brightness in any way. It is still dim. So close and yet so far-- what can I do to fix this?

 I don't know why the repair shop jumped to a logic board issue.  I would assume your backlight LED driver broke.  It is extremely common problem in almost all laptops, and can easily be caused by liquid damage.
I believe (someone please correct me if I'm wrong) the LED driver board on this machine is part of the LCD, which will need to be replaced if the LED driver board is broken.  We have the guide for the entire Display Assembly.  Getting the LCD out of the Display Assembly is likely going to cause some irreversible cosmetic damage, I would recommend replacing the whole thing.
EDIT: This computer has an LED backlight, so no inverter.

 any updates? I have the exact problem right now.

 OK, Your edit said that there is no inverter, I will either replace the display or get an HDMI cable and hook it up to a monitor. Thanks!

 i have the same issue? apple genius wanted a price for a new macbook ( mine is a mid 2013 macbook air). I got a new screen, switched it but it gave the same result. The guy at apple said they might need to change the logic board or tiny piece of it! I wonder if there is a tiny piece to change or is it the whole logic board.
I will order a new logic board and change it my self and will keep you posted!
if anyone else had this issue please let us know.
P.S. I can see everything and use the macbook normally when i shine a light source on it real close, like an iPhone flash!

 I'm having same problem as your's my laptop display is also very dim. i Tried cleaning the plugs but it
did'nt works A shopkeeper said that he will take rs1200 to fix it
