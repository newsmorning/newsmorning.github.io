As a tech-savvy person, I always love going through my old gadgets and computers, and taking a trip down memory lane. Recently, I found myself looking through the old folders on my Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012, and I was stunned by what I found.

Among all the usual files and documents, I stumbled upon a folder entitled "Secrets." I had no recollection of this folder, and it piqued my curiosity. I clicked on it, and what I found inside left me bewildered.

The folder contained numerous PDF files, videos, and images of classified information regarding a government program. I couldn't believe what I was seeing - how did this folder end up on my Macbook? Was my computer compromised by some hacker or was it just an accidental download from an external source?

I knew I had to act fast, and the first thing that came to my mind was to approach the authorities. I immediately contacted the local FBI office, and they responded promptly, asking me to forward the contents of the folder to them.

It turned out that the folder contained highly sensitive information pertaining to an undercover operation carried out by the government, and it was a matter of national security. The FBI launched an investigation and found out that the folder was accidentally shared and downloaded over a peer-to-peer network by one of the agents involved in the operation.

I was left awestruck by the gravity of the situation. I never thought that something like this could happen to me, and I was grateful that I stumbled upon the folder and reported it to the authorities. It was a surreal experience, and it made me realize how important it is to be vigilant when it comes to online security.

In conclusion, going through your old gadgets and computers can yield some unexpected surprises. You never know what you might find, and it could be something as life-changing as what I found in my Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 folder. It's essential to be aware of what you store on your devices and ensure that you take necessary precautions to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of your information. Otherwise, you could end up in a situation that could harm not only you but also your country's interests.

## Chosen Solution
 I too have this issue on a mid 2012 unibody MBP.
It was running a Samsung SSD, flawlessly for years (purchased 2016), then it crashed one day last week and wouldn’t start. I got the folder with a ? in it and went through an internet recovery, whereupon, after downloading the OS, the machine restarted to the prohibitory symbol.
I installed a brand new Samsung SSD, formatted it to journaled in disk utility and then downloaded the OS again, assuming the 8 year old previous SSD (which I had used in previous iterations of MBP) had developed a fault. Same thing happened - it restarted to the prohibitory symbol.
Perhaps tellingly, the original SSD, when placed in a caddy enabled the Mac to start up as normal through a USB cable.
I therefore suspect the issue is a SATA cable failure, as you imply can be a cause.
What’s your view based on this description?
thanks.

 Yes you need a new HD SATA cable!

Besides the tape you want to find an old BIC ball point pen to get the ink straw out of it as you’ll need it to help you bend the cable as a brake form. You don’t want to crease the cable as that also damages it! Use the straw to help you create a nice smooth arc as you not want to exceed the radius of the straw.
