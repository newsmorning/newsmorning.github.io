Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When You Press the Add Water, Heating, and Medium Cup Buttons on Your Keurig Elite!

Introduction:

If you're a coffee lover, you're likely familiar with the Keurig Elite, the popular coffee maker that uses single-serving pods to brew your favorite blend of coffee. But did you know that there's more to this appliance than just pressing a button and waiting for your cup to fill up? In this article, we'll explore what happens when you press the Add Water, Heating, and Medium Cup Buttons on your Keurig Elite.

Body:

Add Water Button:

The first step to brewing a perfect cup of coffee in your Keurig Elite is to add water. Pressing the Add Water Button will initiate a series of events that will fill the internal reservoir with water. After pressing the button, you'll hear the sound of water flowing from the tap, filling the reservoir. Once the reservoir is filled, the machine will beep twice to let you know that the water has reached the correct level.

Heating Button:

After the reservoir is filled with water, it's time to heat it up. The Heating Button is what you need to press next to start the process. Once pressed, the Keurig Elite will begin heating up the water to the perfect temperature for brewing coffee, which is between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. The machine uses a heating element to bring the water up to the desired temperature, and the LED light on the button will change from red to green to let you know when the water is hot enough for brewing.

Medium Cup Button:

Now that the water is heated, it's time to brew your cup of coffee. The Medium Cup Button is what you need to press to select the cup size you want to brew. Once pressed, the Keurig Elite will begin pumping the hot water into the pod that you've inserted into the machine. The coffee will start to brew and will drop into your mug below. The machine will continue brewing until the desired amount of coffee has been dispensed, which is approximately 8 ounces for the medium cup size.

Conclusion:

Pressing the Add Water, Heating, and Medium Cup Buttons on your Keurig Elite is more than just a simple task of making coffee. The process involves several steps, including filling the reservoir with water, heating the water to the perfect temperature, and brewing the coffee to the correct amount. Each step ensures that you're getting a perfect cup of coffee every time. So, the next time you're brewing a cup of coffee in your Keurig Elite, remember what happens behind the scenes and appreciate the technology that's at work to give you that delicious cup of coffee you love.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently moved cities and after unpacking I noticed my Keurig is no longer working. When I turn my Keurig on, the machine will display the add water, heating and medium cup buttons and they will all be blinking. I tried to replace the external water reservoir and even opened up the bottom of the Keurig to drain the internal reservoir however I have not seen any results. If anyone has had a similar problem, please feel free on what to do in order to fix this.

 I just came across this problem myself. Nothing suggested worked.   So I pressed and heldto middle cup button while all the lights were flashing until they stopped, all the cup lights came on solid, I opened and closed the k cup basket.  Then pressed the middle size cup button again,  and it dumped a lot of hot water,  about 12 to 14 Oz.   More than the largest cup size,  and now it is running normal again.  Hope this helps.

 I see this is an old post but just in case anybody else runs across it I had the same problem. When you remove the top cover of the water reservoir the Overflow elbow at the top of the reservoir should be clear silicone looking plug your finger over the top of it open the Keurig K-Cup holder close it back hit the Brew button with your finger still held over the elbow and it should Purge the air from the line and get you back to working

 While it’s doing all that blinking and humming:
Take off the reservoir lid.Grab hold of the reservoir with one hand and pump the tank up and down (basically lift the tank up a little and bring it back down, over and over).At the same time, with your other hand, cover the overflow elbow plastic tube at the top of the reservoir. You’ll feel a slight suction the more you pump.Hopefully one or both of the cup buttons are lit-press one  when it’s trying to pump the water through, cover the elbow again here and there to create suction. Water should flow through where the coffee goes.
Side notes:
This is the model with just two size cup options, power and auto off buttons, and lights for add water, descale, and heating.
Problem:
When turned on, it would hum for a while before any other light would come on. When it did, add water, heating, and one cup light were blinking. Water would not pass through.
Tried:
Cleaned out the needle part with a paperclip.
Opened the top part and squeezed the tubes in case there was blockage.
Pressing auto off and power button at the same time.
All the tips and videos I could find, etc, but maybe they all helped contribute to fixing it but it wasn’t until I pumped the reservoir AND covered the elbow that it worked.
GOOD LUCK!

 I also had this issue and tried all of the above solutions to no avail :( I called the help line and what they told me worked!
Unplug your Keurig.Straighten out a bobby pin.Open the lid and locate the needle that enters into your k-pod. Be careful, this is extremely sharp!Use your bobby pin and insert it into the 2-3 holes (depending on your model) in the needle. Do this for each hole 10-12 times.Plug in your Keurig and brew a few water only cups until the water is clear and free of coffee grinds.Enjoy your coffee and clean Keurig.

 Had same code. The top needle that punctures the K-Cup was clogged. Turn off..Remove water tank... Open K-Cup basket... Tilt machine back enough to see pin.... Carefully insert a needle or pin to clear the obstruction. I then ran a few large cups through with No cup in basket to flush out the grounds. Repeat if necessary.

 My issue was the mesh at the bottom of the water tank was clogged with a layer of film.  I found the issue by taking the water tank off, then while holding over the sink pressed up on the valve on the bottom of the tank.  No water came out.  I then rinsed the water tank out several times with very hot water and the film came off and water started flowing.  Probably using vinegar would have worked better, but its back working now.

 I have  tried all these fixes and none work. I get to the point of brewing and nothing comes out. I followed the directions all the way to pushing the middle size cup button, and nothing happens. Can anybody help me?

 What you are describing is a brewing system blocked error.  In other words the system is unable to move liquid through the brewing system.   Unplug the maker.
1)  Dirt or grounds may be lodged into the water injector.  This is often an issue if you grind your own coffee (making the grind too fine).    You will need to get a fine sewing needle (or pin) to attempt to clear out the needle that the maker uses to insert into the K-Cup.
2) Water tank connection to the maker being blocked by debris.   The blockage can be in the water tank itself or in the connection on the brewer.  I used a toothbrush and some vinegar to clean both areas.
Once I did that  I plugged it in and it started working.  I then descaled the maker and haven’t had issue since.

 Jest keep turning on and pushing cup button it's bold up it takes a while to
