Step 3: Locate The PM IC
The PM IC is located on the motherboard of your iPhone 6 Plus. It's a small square chip that's easy to identify.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi! My iPhone won't turn on n charge. I can connect to the iPhone in DFU mode and iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Popup the message You must restore this iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.
I go to other shop they think may be PM ic isn't working they change the IC but iPhone still won't turn on.
Now the problem is after change PM ic i can't connect to the iPhone in DFU mode.
Is Possible after change the original PM ic to other ic can't connect to DFU mode or recovery mode???
Thanks

 1.我不清楚你在哪里？我认为你的iphone永远都维修不好了。
2.当iphone进入dfu模式，连接itunes刷机看看错误代码是什么再来判断问题在哪里。
3.你在当地维修，现在手机变成无法进入dfu模式，明显是比较越来越糟糕的。
