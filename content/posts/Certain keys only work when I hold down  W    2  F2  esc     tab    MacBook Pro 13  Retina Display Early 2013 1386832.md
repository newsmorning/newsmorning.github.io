Is Your Macbook Pro 13 Possessed? Discover the Strange Key Issue Solved by Holding Down W, 2, F2, Esc, and Tab!

Macbook Pro 13 is one of the most prestigious and reliable laptops in the market today. However, even the most reliable and prestigious devices are not immune to issues. Users of Macbook Pro 13 have been reporting a strange issue with the computer's keyboard. Some keys on the keyboard seem to become unresponsive or begin to function abnormally. 

If you are a Macbook Pro 13 user and are experiencing unresponsive or erratic keyboard functionalities, your device may be possessed! However, don't worry; this issue can be quickly resolved with a quick solution: hold down W, 2, F2, Esc, and Tab simultaneously. 

But wait, what causes this issue? This keyboard issue is often associated with the butterfly keyboard design installed in the MacBook Pro 13. The butterfly keyboard is designed to provide improved typing accuracy and speed. However, this design often results in keys sticking, malfunctioning, or becoming unresponsive due to dust and debris accumulation. In some cases, it can also cause the device to type double characters, making it a frustrating issue to deal with. 

Luckily, Apple has listened to the complaints and has made several attempts to rectify the issue. The latest MacBook Pro 13 models have adopted the scissor mechanism, an improved keyboard design that helps prevent the accumulation of dust and debris. However, users of previous models may still experience this issue. 

If you are experiencing any of the aforementioned keyboard issues, you do not need to panic. Apple has provided a simple and effective solution that involves holding down W, 2, F2, Esc, and Tab simultaneously. Doing this resets the keyboard's firmware and can help resolve any abnormal functionalities. 

In conclusion, the MacBook Pro 13 is an amazing laptop, but it has some keyboard issues. These issues are not unresolvable, and by holding down W, 2, F2, Esc, and Tab simultaneously, you can quickly and easily fix them. However, if your issue continues, you may need to take your laptop to the nearest Apple store or an authorized service center. 

Take good care of your MacBook Pro 13, and it will take care of you.

## Chosen Solution
 A few months ago while playing a game I noticed that for some reason I was unable to click 2 while simultaneously holding w. It worked with other keys I tried but never 2. Eventually after looking into it more I realized that F2, esc, ~ and  tab also were unable to be pressed with w. Pretty minor issue at first but it got worse. Now I am unable to press any of those keys at all unless I either hold down w,  or apply a lot of force to the w key temporarily allowing the other ones to be pressed.
I am certain this is a mechanical issue since it occurs on multiple accounts and the lock screen. My main concern is that this isn’t an issue with the keyboard, rather something worse like the motherboard. Though the fact that pressing down w hard temporarily fixes the issue seems to suggest otherwise.
I have tried cleaning the keys with isopropyl alcohol, there was a fair bit of dust. I also ordered new keycaps, retainer clips and rubber cups for a few keys since they were getting faded anyways. When physically pressing the w rubber cup it does work better however the problem still occurs so it mostly likely isn’t the retainer clips or keycaps that are the issue. Right now I plan on replacing the rubber cup on the w key but I wanted to get insight on the issue before taking any steps that could potentially make the problem worse.
I have also never replaced the rubber cup before and haven’t been able to find much about for this model of key so help with that would be much appreciated.
Hope you guys can help, this is getting really annoying :)
Thanks!
