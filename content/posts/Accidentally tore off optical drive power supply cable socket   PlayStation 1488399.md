Playstation Owners Beware: The One Mistake That Could DESTROY Your Optical Drive!

Gaming enthusiasts know the joy of playing a game that runs smoothly without any glitches or issues. Owning a Playstation and enjoying the wide range of gaming options it offers is a dream come true for many. However, there is one mistake that Playstation owners should avoid, as it could prove disastrous for their optical drive.

Before we delve into the mistake that could potentially destroy your Playstation's optical drive, let's first understand what an optical drive is. An optical drive is a device that reads and writes data from an optical disc, such as a CD, DVD or Blu-ray disc. It is a vital component of a gaming console as it allows the console to read the game discs and play the games.

The one mistake that Playstation owners should avoid at all costs is keeping their game console vertical while playing a game. Many people believe that keeping the console in a vertical position saves space and makes it look sleeker. However, this could be a costly mistake in the long run.

When a Playstation is kept in a vertical position, the optical drive has to work harder than usual to read the disc. This is because the weight of the disc falls on the drive, adding pressure to its mechanism. Over time, this can cause the drive's mechanism to wear out, leading to errors when playing games and, in severe cases, rendering the optical drive unusable.

So, what can you do to avoid damaging the optical drive of your Playstation? The simple answer is to keep the console horizontal while playing games. This way, the weight of the disc is evenly distributed across the drive, reducing the pressure on the mechanism. Additionally, placing the console on a flat surface can prevent it from falling or toppling over, avoiding further damage.

In conclusion, Playstation owners who cherish their gaming experiences should take extra care in maintaining their console. Avoiding the mistake of keeping the console vertical while playing games can go a long way in ensuring the longevity and durability of the Playstation's optical drive. With proper care, a Playstation can provide endless hours of gaming fun for years to come!

## Chosen Solution
 While doing repairs I realized I had torn off the optical drive power supply cable socket from the motherboard. That's the white plastic thing with the metal parts. The metal pins are intact. Should I solder then back on? If so, do you have any tips?

 I can’t see if the solder pads on the board are damaged or not, from the look of the pins you should be fine.
It won’t be a difficult job but always practise first if you aren’t sure of your abilities. Use a small amount of solder to help reflow the existing solder on the pins.
