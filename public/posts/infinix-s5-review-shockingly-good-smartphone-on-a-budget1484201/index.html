As technology continues to advance rapidly, smartphones have become a necessity for people of all ages. It is no secret that smartphones have become a critical part of our daily lives, ranging from communication to work and entertainment. However, with the rise of technology, smartphones have become expensive, and only a few can afford them. Fortunately, smartphone manufacturers are now introducing budget-friendly devices that offer great features without breaking the bank. One such device is the Infinix S5 smartphone.\nThe Infinix S5 smartphone is a budget-friendly device that boasts some insane features that are likely to surprise you. The device is a perfect fit for individuals who cannot afford high-end smartphones but still want to enjoy the benefits of technology. So, without further ado, let’s dive into some of the features that make the Infinix S5 stand out from other budget-friendly devices.\nDisplay One of the standout features of the Infinix S5 smartphone is its display. The device features a massive 6.6-inch HD+ Infinity-O display with a resolution of 720 x 1600 pixels. The Infinity-O display provides an immersive viewing experience, making it an excellent device for streaming videos, playing games, and browsing the internet.\nCamera Another insane feature you won’t believe the Infinix S5 has to offer is its camera. The device features a quad-camera setup at the back, which comprises 16MP primary sensor, 5MP ultra-wide-angle lens, 2MP depth sensor, and a dedicated low light sensor. The quad-camera setup is designed to capture stunning photos, be it in low-light conditions or bright daylight.\nThe device also comes with a 32MP front camera that is perfect for taking stunning selfies that will leave your friends and family in awe.\nStorage and performance The Infinix S5 smartphone is powered by a MediaTek Helio P22 chipset and comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB internal storage. The device also supports expandable storage of up to 256GB via a microSD card. With such storage capacity, you can easily store all your files, including photos, videos, and music.\nIn addition, the device promises smooth performance, making multitasking a breeze. The MediaTek Helio P22 chipset delivers excellent performance while consuming minimal power, ensuring that the device lasts longer without needing a recharge.\nBattery life Lastly, the Infinix S5 smartphone boasts a massive 4,000mAh battery that provides excellent battery life. The device can last for an entire day of heavy usage or even more with moderate usage. The battery also supports fast charging, allowing you to charge the device at lightning speeds.\nConclusion Overall, the Infinix S5 is an excellent budget-friendly device that offers some insane features that are likely to surprise you. The device boasts a massive display, a quad-camera setup, excellent storage and performance, and a long-lasting battery. If you are looking for a budget-friendly device that can go toe-to-toe with high-end devices, then the Infinix S5 is the device for you.\nThe Infinix S5 family of devices that include the Infinix S5 Lite, S5, and S5 Pro were unveiled way back in October 2019 but started selling in local markets towards the end of 2019.\nInfinix S5 came to the market as an update to the Infinix S4 launched in April of 2019. Note that I am calling it an update and not an upgrade or a successor. This, because the two devices are not widely different. We unboxed the Infinix S5 a few weeks ago and I have been using it since. After about two weeks with the device, here’s our review of the device. First off, let us talk about that design.\nLooks and Feel The Infinix S5 is a pretty device, period. It is available in three color options, Cyan, Nebula Black and the one that I have, Violet.\nIt has a gradient paint job and a striped pattern at the back but it is not textured. The device feels good in the hand and isn’t as weighty as I initially thought.\nWhile this is a massive device, the overall footprint isn’t as big. This is probably due to its 90.5% screen-to-body ratio. Its curved edges also help its ergonomically. It takes some time to get used to the size but once you do, it is fine.\nDisplay The Infinix S5 spots a massive 6.6 inch, 720p display with 270 dpi, and a resolution of 1600 x 720 — a relatively low screen resolution for a massive canvas.\nThe display appears a little pixelated, but that is probably because I have been spoilt by 1440p Samsung OLED panels and anything less that than that feels like a downgrade. However, scrolling through social media was okay and while watching Netflix or YouTube content which the device maxes out at 720p, the display felt great.\nThe device has a hole-punch on the top left corner that houses the 32MP selfie shooter and, while I still feel like pop-up selfie cameras are a better implementation, I didn’t mind this one. It is small in comparison to the 6.6-inch panel and doesn’t really intrude on your content consumption.\nIf you don’t want it there, there’s an option in settings to hide it altogether, but that adds an unsightly black bezel-like bar up-top the display.\nPerformance Infinix S5 is powered by the Mediatek Helio P22 Octa-core CPU which clocks at 2.0GHz. The unit I have been using pairs that up with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage.\nIn daily use, the MediaTek chip held up pretty well. Scrolling through social media, watching movies and normal usage, the device also held up pretty well. However, there were some instances where I felt like I needed to wait for the device to catch up.\nThis was mostly when juggling between heavy office apps on the device. I am not much of a gamer but I tried playing Asphalt on this device and on medium settings, the device heated up considerably but the game remained playable.\nI feel like the device could use a little more power, but for the average user, this is more than enough to get them going comfortably.\nSoftware The Infinix S5 still packs the now-aging Android 9 Pie. This OS is a skinned version of Android 9 Pie and Infinix slapped its XOS 5.5.2 Cheetah on top of it. This build of XOS is extensive and could use a whole different post to explore the features it packs. And that is exactly how I would describe XOS 5 Cheetah — feature-packed.\nWhile unboxing this device weeks ago, we mentioned the sheer number of bloatware that shipped with my unit. Luckily, most of those are uninstallable. The rest, you can easily disable them.\nI would advise anyone buying the Infinix S5 to take some time to uninstall and get rid of all the junk and bloatware before installing new apps. One feature that I wish was included was system-wide Dark Mode.\nBaked-In Features XOS is jam-packed with features and we shall explore many of these in an upcoming XOS 5 review. Some of these features include;\nWhatsApp Mode switches off data for all other apps and services except WhatsApp.Social Turbo allows users to apply effects on video call apps like WhatsApp.Smart Panel adds a sidebar with quick shortcuts to various tasks and apps.Action \u0026 Gestures allows users to pick calls hands-free.Game Mode mutes all incoming notifications and kills unnecessary background tasks for better game performance.Bike Mode rejects all incoming calls while you’re riding, and many more features. Software Updates Infinix has been known to cheap out when it comes to pushing out updates to its devices. But that’s not the case with this device.\nSince getting the Infinix S5, I have been treated to two software updates, one when I unboxed the device and a few days ago, I got an update that brought the June Android security patch.\nSecurity The Infinix S5 offers the standard methods of authentication that come with Android; PIN, Password, Pattern. On top of these, the S5 offers users two modes of biometric authentication; Face Unlock and Fingerprint.\nThe face unlock uses the front-facing camera so this might be a lot less secure than devices that base their face unlock on infrared. It also only works well in well-lit areas.\nThe fingerprint sensor is mounted at the back of the device like many other smartphones. I really didn’t like the fingerprint sensor on this device as it failed quite a lot for me. It is also pretty slow to authenticate so oftentimes, I found myself using the PIN after all, which kinda defeats the purpose of having biometric authentication.\nBattery The device packs a 4,000 mAh battery cell. This has been able to routinely get me through most days of active use. By the end of a normal day that involves endless social media sessions, calls, listening to hours of podcasts and music, I would end the day with around 20% of charge left.\nOne area where the device falls short, at least in my opinion is the lack of any form of fast charging. The device takes around 3 hours to get fully charged using the bundled charger. I tried using my 18W fast charger but that didn’t shorten the charge times.\nCameras First, I need to mention that I am not an avid photographer by any stretch of the word. I, like many of you, like a camera that I can quickly point and shoot without having to tweak any settings.\nThe Infinix S5 comes with a set of 4 cameras;\n16MP Main Camera5MP Ultra-wide camera2MP depth sensor and A QVGA Camera for low light shots The 32MP AI shooter will effortlessly cater your selfies needs.\nIn good lighting, the S5 took really decent-looking photos with a good dynamic range for the most part. The 5MP Ultrawide camera is also a nice addition but at 5MP, the shots lack in terms of detail. If I am being honest, I didn’t really see the advantage of the other two lenses; the 2MP depth sensor and the QVGA low light camera as Portrait shots and low light performance left a lot to be desired.\nThe selfie camera also performed pretty well and the 32MP camera resulted in pretty detailed shots. However, Infinix’s Beauty mode was a little too aggressive when it came to smoothing out skin tones. I understand why this might have an appeal to some users but for most, maybe it is a bit too much.\nI will continue to take the S5 camera through its paces in the coming few days so stay tuned for an upcoming camera review of this device.\nConclusion It is almost impossible to fully talk about any smartphone as these complex pieces of engineering bring a lot to the table, some that you won’t even notice throughout your period of owning the device. That said, below are some of the things we liked about the Infinix S5 and some things that could have been better.\nWhat We Liked Battery life is pretty impressive.The price is attainable for mostScreen is not so bad, especially when consuming mediaThe device is well built and looks more premium than it actually is.The cameras are okay for the price.Some built-in XOS features could be useful to some users. Things We Disliked Micro-USB in 2020 is unacceptableLack of fast-charging is a huge bummer.XOS is a bit too much on bloatware.The speakers lack depth/bass. All through my usage, it was pretty apparent that this is more of an update to the previous generation Infinix S4 than a successor. The new changes are subtle but very welcome.\nAt KES 15,000, you’ll be hard-pressed to find better alternatives. However, the Infinix Note 7 line of devices seems like yet another option if you’re in the market for a new device.\nRelated ","wordCount":"1967","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marshall Nkomo"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-s5-review-shockingly-good-smartphone-on-a-budget1484201/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe the insane features this budget-friendly Infinix S5 smartphone has to offer!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 21, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1967 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Marshall Nkomo</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#display>Display</a></li><li><a href=#camera>Camera</a></li><li><a href=#storage-and-performance>Storage and performance</a></li><li><a href=#battery-life>Battery life</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#looks-and-feel>Looks and Feel</a></li><li><a href=#display-1>Display</a></li><li><a href=#performance>Performance</a></li><li><a href=#software>Software</a><ul><li><a href=#baked-in-features>Baked-In Features</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#software-updates>Software Updates</a></li><li><a href=#security>Security</a></li><li><a href=#battery>Battery</a></li><li><a href=#cameras>Cameras</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion-1>Conclusion</a><ul><li><a href=#what-we-liked>What We Liked</a></li><li><a href=#things-we-disliked>Things We Disliked</a></li><li><a href=#related>Related</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=you-wont-believe-the-insane-features-this-budget-friendly-infinix-s5-smartphone-has-to-offer>You won&rsquo;t believe the insane features this budget-friendly Infinix S5 smartphone has to offer!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-wont-believe-the-insane-features-this-budget-friendly-infinix-s5-smartphone-has-to-offer>#</a></h1><p>As technology continues to advance rapidly, smartphones have become a necessity for people of all ages.

Some of these features include;</p><ul><li>WhatsApp Mode switches off data for all other apps and services except WhatsApp.Social Turbo allows users to apply effects on video call apps like WhatsApp.Smart Panel adds a sidebar with quick shortcuts to various tasks and apps.Action & Gestures allows users to pick calls hands-free.Game Mode mutes all incoming notifications and kills unnecessary background tasks for better game performance.Bike Mode rejects all incoming calls while you’re riding, and many more features.</li></ul><h2 id=software-updates>Software Updates<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#software-updates>#</a></h2><p>Infinix has been known to cheap out when it comes to pushing out updates to its devices. But that’s not the case with this device.</p><p>Since getting the Infinix S5, I have been treated to two software updates, one when I unboxed the device and a few days ago, I got an update that brought the June Android security patch.</p><h2 id=security>Security<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#security>#</a></h2><p>The Infinix S5 offers the standard methods of authentication that come with Android; PIN, Password, Pattern. On top of these, the S5 offers users two modes of biometric authentication; Face Unlock and Fingerprint.</p><p>The face unlock uses the front-facing camera so this might be a lot less secure than devices that base their face unlock on infrared. It also only works well in well-lit areas.</p><p>The fingerprint sensor is mounted at the back of the device like many other smartphones. I really didn’t like the fingerprint sensor on this device as it failed quite a lot for me. It is also pretty slow to authenticate so oftentimes, I found myself using the PIN after all, which kinda defeats the purpose of having biometric authentication.</p><h2 id=battery>Battery<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#battery>#</a></h2><p>The device packs a 4,000 mAh battery cell. This has been able to routinely get me through most days of active use. By the end of a normal day that involves endless social media sessions, calls, listening to hours of podcasts and music, I would end the day with around 20% of charge left.</p><p>One area where the device falls short, at least in my opinion is the lack of any form of fast charging. The device takes around 3 hours to get fully charged using the bundled charger. I tried using my 18W fast charger but that didn’t shorten the charge times.</p><h2 id=cameras>Cameras<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cameras>#</a></h2><p>First, I need to mention that I am not an avid photographer by any stretch of the word. I, like many of you, like a camera that I can quickly point and shoot without having to tweak any settings.</p><p>The Infinix S5 comes with a set of 4 cameras;</p><ul><li>16MP Main Camera5MP Ultra-wide camera2MP depth sensor and A QVGA Camera for low light shots</li></ul><p>The 32MP AI shooter will effortlessly cater your selfies needs.</p><p>In good lighting, the S5 took really decent-looking photos with a good dynamic range for the most part. The 5MP Ultrawide camera is also a nice addition but at 5MP, the shots lack in terms of detail. If I am being honest, I didn’t really see the advantage of the other two lenses; the 2MP depth sensor and the QVGA low light camera as Portrait shots and low light performance left a lot to be desired.</p><p>The selfie camera also performed pretty well and the 32MP camera resulted in pretty detailed shots. However, Infinix’s Beauty mode was a little too aggressive when it came to smoothing out skin tones. I understand why this might have an appeal to some users but for most, maybe it is a bit too much.</p><p>I will continue to take the S5 camera through its paces in the coming few days so stay tuned for an upcoming camera review of this device.</p><h2 id=conclusion-1>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion-1>#</a></h2><p>It is almost impossible to fully talk about any smartphone as these complex pieces of engineering bring a lot to the table, some that you won’t even notice throughout your period of owning the device. That said, below are some of the things we liked about the Infinix S5 and some things that could have been better.</p><h3 id=what-we-liked>What We Liked<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-we-liked>#</a></h3><ul><li>Battery life is pretty impressive.The price is attainable for mostScreen is not so bad, especially when consuming mediaThe device is well built and looks more premium than it actually is.The cameras are okay for the price.Some built-in XOS features could be useful to some users.</li></ul><h3 id=things-we-disliked>Things We Disliked<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#things-we-disliked>#</a></h3><ul><li>Micro-USB in 2020 is unacceptableLack of fast-charging is a huge bummer.XOS is a bit too much on bloatware.The speakers lack depth/bass.</li></ul><p>All through my usage, it was pretty apparent that this is more of an update to the previous generation Infinix S4 than a successor. The new changes are subtle but very welcome.</p><p>At KES 15,000, you’ll be hard-pressed to find better alternatives. However, the Infinix Note 7 line of devices seems like yet another option if you’re in the market for a new device.</p><h3 id=related>Related<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#related>#</a></h3></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/charger-for-g5-7-85-trio-tablet-636794/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>You Won't Believe How This Charger Revives Your Dead G5 7 85 Trio Tablet!</span></a>
