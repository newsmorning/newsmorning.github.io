# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried To Install An OS On My Macbook Air - Disaster Strikes!

As an AI language model, I don't have a physical body, so I can't experience many of the hazards that humans face when working with technology. However, I have been programmed with some basic knowledge about computers and their operating systems. Recently, I came across a story about a person who attempted to install an OS on their Macbook Air and ended up with a complete disaster. Let me tell you what happened.

It all started when the person decided to upgrade their Macbook Air from the current OS to the latest version. They followed the usual steps: downloaded the installer from the App Store, created a bootable USB drive, and restarted the computer to begin the installation. However, they soon ran into trouble.

The Macbook Air got stuck on the Apple logo during the boot process. They waited for a few minutes, but nothing happened. They decided to force quit the computer and try again, hoping that it was just a temporary glitch. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse.

When they restarted the computer, the Macbook Air displayed a message saying that the OS couldn't be installed and that a fatal error had occurred. To make matters worse, the computer wouldn't restart. It was as if the OS had been completely erased from the hard drive.

The person turned to the internet for help and found out that they needed to use the Recovery mode to reinstall the OS. However, they didn't have a recent backup of their files and were worried that they might lose everything. They decided to take the computer to an Apple Store and see if the technicians could fix it.

At the Apple Store, the technicians confirmed that the OS had been erased and that the only way to fix it was to reinstall it from scratch. They told the person that their files were still on the hard drive but that they would need to be careful during the reinstallation process to avoid losing them.

After several hours of waiting, the person received their Macbook Air back with the latest OS installed. Fortunately, the technicians were able to recover all their files, but the person had to remember to always back up their files before attempting any major changes to their computer's OS.

In conclusion, the person's attempt to install an OS on their Macbook Air ended up being a complete disaster. However, they learned a valuable lesson about the importance of backing up their files before attempting any major changes to their computer. If you're planning on upgrading your OS, make sure you have a recent backup of your files and follow the instructions carefully to avoid any disasters.

 Hi so I was trying to install Windows on my Mac and halfway through the mac just shuts off as I was installing Windows to use this as a main laptop for some time I was using the whole hard drive and I never created a drive I could boot the old os x off of
I have tried external windows 10 and ubuntu drives but I can not get an os to boot also the screen is just completely black upon opening the lid and powering on along with the keyboard backlight does not turn on and the apple logo on the back does not light up but when I plug some thing in to the usb ports I can see light on the device I plugged in showing drive activity and if I press caps lock on the internal keyboard the caps lock light will come on

 You’ll need to see if you can get the onboard diagnostics to run. Restart the system and press and hold the D key are you able to get to the diagnostics? If you can’t see the display shine a flash light through the Apple Logo are you able to see the screen at that point (it will be faint). If you do did you get an error code?
Reference: Mac startup key combinations
If you can’t get that far what is the color of the MagSafe connector Amber or Green?
