If you own a Samsung Galaxy S5, you may have experienced some issues with your phone's charging port. One of the most common problems is a loose or broken charger port - which can be frustrating for many users. However, you'll be surprised to learn that fixing your Samsung Galaxy S5 charger port is not that difficult.

In this guide, we'll show you how to fix your charger port step by step using simple and affordable tools.

## Step 1: Gather Your Tools

To fix your Samsung Galaxy S5 charger port, you'll need a few tools that you may already have at home or can easily purchase online. Here's what you'll need:

- A set of screwdrivers with different sizes to open your phone
- A prying tool or a guitar pick to remove the back cover
- A new charger port (compatible with Samsung Galaxy S5)

## Step 2: Turn off Your Phone and Remove the Battery

Before starting any repair work on your Samsung Galaxy S5, make sure to turn it off and then remove the battery. This will prevent any power-related damages or injuries from occurring.

## Step 3: Remove the Back Cover and Battery

Using your prying tool or guitar pick, carefully remove the back cover of your Samsung Galaxy S5. Once it's removed, you'll notice the battery attached to the motherboard. Carefully detach it from the motherboard to avoid damaging any other components.

## Step 4: Remove the Screws Holding the Motherboard

Now that you've removed the battery, the next step is to detach the motherboard from the device to access the charging port. To do this, unscrew the screws that hold the motherboard in place. Make sure to keep track of the screws as you'll need them to reassemble your device.

## Step 5: Detach the Charging Port

Once you've removed the screws, gently detach the charging port from the motherboard. Be careful not to damage any other components or cables.

## Step 6: Replace the Old Charging Port with the New One

Now that you have a new compatible charging port, it's time to replace the old one. Carefully attach the new charging port to the motherboard in the same position as the old one.

## Step 7: Reassemble Your Device

After successfully fixing your Samsung Galaxy S5 charging port, carefully reassemble your device in the reverse order of the steps mentioned above. Make sure to screw in all the screws back in their respective places and attach the battery and back cover.

## Step 8: Test and Charge Your Phone

Now that you've successfully fixed your Samsung Galaxy S5 charging port, it's time to test it. Turn on your phone and try to charge it to confirm that the charging port is working correctly. If your device charges correctly, congratulations! You've successfully fixed your Samsung Galaxy S5 charging port.

In conclusion, fixing your Samsung Galaxy S5 charger port is not as complicated as you may think. With basic tools and some patience, you can conveniently fix your phone's charging port in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I accidentally took the charger out slantedly and the little side of the charger port got a little slanted and my charger wont go in to charge help me please

 I have a similar problem but I can still charge the phone with a regular micro USB cable.
I took the phone to several repair shops and they indicated that since this phone is water resistant, opening it is difficult and could crack the screen. and they would have to charge me to fix it if that broke. They advised me to send it to Samsung for repair or just keep using the slower charging micro USB cable. I believe Samsung wants around $80US to fix it and you will be without your phone for several weeks.
