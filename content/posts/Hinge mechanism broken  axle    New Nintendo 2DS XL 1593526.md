Gamers Beware: Fatal Flaw in New Nintendo 2DS XL Hinge Axle Can Ruin Your Gaming Dreams!

The gaming world recently witnessed the launch of the new Nintendo 2DS XL, which quickly became a favorite among gamers, thanks to its sleek design, improved screen size, and extensive gaming library. However, amidst all the excitement and hype, a serious flaw has been found in the design of the hinge axle, which can lead to a disastrous gaming experience.

The hinge axle in the new Nintendo 2DS XL is responsible for keeping the device's top and bottom screens together while allowing them to pivot, providing the gamer with the maximum gaming comfort. However, the hinge axle is made of thin plastic, which makes it vulnerable to wear and tear over time.

The problem arises when the hinge axle breaks, leading to the separation of the top and bottom screens. This, in turn, can cause irreversible damage to the device, rendering it useless. Many gamers have reported that their 2DS XLs have suffered the same fate, leaving them heartbroken and out of pocket for repairs or, in some cases, a new device altogether.

Although Nintendo has attempted to address the issue with a one-year warranty and repairs or replacements, the inconvenience of a broken device and the potential loss of saved game data make the situation daunting. Besides, even though the device may be replaced, the likelihood of the issue recurring again and again due to the defective design is high.

The ongoing frustration of gamers has also led to petitions to urge the company to take responsibility for the defective design by either recalling the faulty devices or working towards creating a new and improved hinge axle that offers durability and longevity.

In conclusion, the fatal flaw in the new Nintendo 2DS XL Hinge Axle is a matter of concern for gamers worldwide. It is essential to exercise caution while using the device and ensure that it is not subjected to undue stress, twist, or force. While we wait for Nintendo to offer a more viable solution to the issue, let us hope that other gaming companies learn from this debacle and prioritize the durability and quality of their devices above aesthetics and convenience.


## Chosen Solution
 The hinge broke on my 2ds xl, not the shell but the mechanism inside (that makes the top display to look in position etc). Do you guys know if the hinge of the new 3ds are interchangeable with the 2ds xl? By looking at the pictures they look pretty similar.
Update (02/04/2021)
I actually found one seller from europe that seels this on ebay.
