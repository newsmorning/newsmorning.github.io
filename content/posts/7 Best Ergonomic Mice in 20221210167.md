# Say Goodbye to Wrist Pain Forever - Check Out These 7 Game-Changing Ergonomic Mice of 2022!

As modern lifestyles become more sedentary, many people find themselves with chronic wrist pain. The root cause of the pain is often the use of traditional computer mice, which require users to keep their wrists in an unnatural position for hours on end. Fortunately, there are now numerous alternatives that prioritize comfort and natural movement. Here are seven of the best ergonomic mice of 2022.

## 1. Logitech MX Vertical

The Logitech MX Vertical is designed for use with your arm in a handshake position, rather than a palm down position. This makes it natural, and there is less strain on your wrist. The MX Vertical also has a unique button placement, which further reduces the stress your hand experiences. 

## 2. Microsoft Sculpt

The Microsoft Sculpt is a great option if you're looking for a compact, wireless mouse that can fit in your bag. The Sculpt has a unique shape that keeps your wrist in a natural position, and it tracks well on most surfaces.

## 3. Anker Vertical Mouse

The Anker Vertical Mouse has a sleek design and a rubber grip that provides extra comfort. It allows for a natural position for your arm that helps alleviate wrist pain. 

## 4. Evoluent Vertical Mouse

The Evoluent Vertical Mouse is another popular choice. It is designed to maintain a natural position and aims to alleviate pain for those suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome. The Evoluent model has six programmable buttons, making it ideal for customization.

## 5. J-Tech Digital Scroll Endurance

The J-Tech Digital Scroll Endurance is designed to fit into your palm and provides a natural resting position for your wrist. The scroll wheel on this mouse is built for endurance and features a smooth, rubber finish that is particularly comfortable during long periods of use.

## 6. 3M Ergonomic Mouse

3M has been a leader in ergonomic products for years. The 3M ergonomic mouse is particularly good for those with discomfort in their fingers and wrists, as it encourages the use of the entire arm rather than just the fingers.

## 7. Penclic Mouse

Lastly, Penclic Mouse is uniquely designed to replicate a traditional pen. It is ergonomically sound and allows you to use your mouse in a far less awkward position than with traditional mice.

Ultimately, there are many options available to help overcome wrist pain when using a computer mouse. Some people may prefer a vertical or ergonomic mouse, while others may prefer a traditional design with extra padding or grip. The important thing is to find the best mouse for your individual needs and preferences so that you can work or play without pain.

Keyboards aren’t the only cause of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive strain injuries (RSIs). The computer mouse is just as much to blame. One of the best ways to prevent RSIs is to use an ergonomic mouse. 
 
Employers and health and safety committees are realizing this, so you may be able to get one at work. The variety available today means there are affordable mice for home and even ergonomic designs for gamers. These are the best ergonomic mice available in 2022, in our opinion.
 
## What to Look for in an Ergonomic Mouse
 
If you’re not familiar with ergonomic mice, they can look weird. There are several types. The key to selecting one is to make sure it’s comfortable for your hand and wrist. A quick way to see what style may be best for you is to shake someone’s hand. Notice the angle of your wrist and the degree angle that your hand is rotated. An ergonomic mouse that mimics this is your best bet. Pair it with one of the best ergonomic keyboards and say so-long to wrist pain.
 

 
Next, consider the technical aspects. 
 
- Does the mouse work on Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS? Many will work on any operating system, but sometimes with limited functionality. Is it left-handed or right-handed? Most are right-handed. Wireless 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, or dongle? Dongles get lost but some like the Logitech allow connection of both the mouse and keyboard. Do you need programmable buttons or are the conventional mouse buttons enough? What’s the DPI? That’s the resolution or precision of the mouse. The higher the DPI number, the greater the precision.

 
## Features and Functions in Ergonomic Mice
 
You’ll see ergonomic mice in different configurations with a variety of mouse features, like scroll wheels, trackballs, palm rests, programmable buttons and more. But what do they do and how do they help?
 
- Trackballs: The idea behind the trackball is to replace the optical sensor on the bottom of the mouse so you don’t have to slide the mouse around. Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. Often you see trackballs built into the side of the mouse.Scroll Wheels: Chances are your regular mouse has a scroll wheel too, and they’re convenient. The ergonomic benefit of the scroll wheel is to reduce the amount you need to move the mouse. Palm or Wrist Rest: Sometimes built-in, sometimes removable, a palm or wrist rest can elevate the wrist enough that the hand is in line with the forearm in a neutral position. The less bend in the wrist the lower the chance of carpal tunnel syndrome.Thumb Rest: Picture a traditional mouse, but with a ledge that the thumb can sit on. This neutralizes the curvature of the hand across its width, relieving pressure in the wrist.Programmable Buttons: The best ergonomic mice use programmable buttons and thumb buttons as well as the standard right and left click. It makes the mouse more functional as the buttons can often be programmed to do repetitive tasks saving you unnecessary movement or keystrokes on a keyboard.Vertical Design: The vertical mouse looks like a normal mouse was put on its side. When holding it, you’ll notice that your hand is very close to the handshake position that’s favorable to your wrist’s health.Adjustable Angle: Although rare, some mice allow for customization of the wrist and forearm rotation degree angle. This can help you dial in the right angle for you.Wireless: Yes, a wireless mouse is more ergonomic than a wired mouse. More free movement and less fighting with cables reduces muscle fatigue. Plus a clean desktop is just nice.
