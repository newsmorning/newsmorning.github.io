# Say Goodbye to Annoying Microsoft Edge Warnings - Discover the Top 5 Proven Methods!

Are you tired of seeing constant Microsoft Edge warnings on your computer every time you attempt to browse the internet? These warnings can be frustrating and distracting, particularly, when you’re working on something important. Fortunately, there are numerous ways to get rid of these warnings and enjoy a seamless browsing experience. In this article, we’ll explore five proven methods to help you say goodbye to annoying Microsoft Edge warnings for good.

## Method 1: Update Your Windows Operating System

The first step to stopping annoying Microsoft Edge warnings is keeping your windows operating system up-to-date. Microsoft constantly releases updates that fix bugs, enhance security, and improve stability. These updates also include fixes for Microsoft Edge, and updating your operating system will help eliminate the warnings that you're experiencing.

To check whether your operating system is up-to-date, click on the Windows start button, select ‘Settings,’ then ‘Update & Security,’ and click on ‘Windows Update’ to check for updates. Once the updates are installed, the annoying warnings should disappear.

## Method 2: Disable SmartScreen Filter

SmartScreen is a built-in feature in Microsoft Edge that works as a filter to prevent phishing attempts, viruses, malware, and other malicious software from entering your computer. However, it may be overly sensitive at times, causing it to flag legitimate websites as untrustworthy and display annoying warnings. To disable this filter, follow these steps:

1. Open Microsoft Edge and click on the three dots on the top-right corner of the browser.

2. Click on ‘Settings,’ then ‘Privacy, search, and services.’

3. Scroll down the page and click on the ‘Security’ option.

4. Next to the SmartScreen filter, click on the toggle switch to turn it off.

Once done, you should be able to browse safely without annoying warnings. However, keep in mind that disabling SmartScreen filter may expose you to a higher risk of malware, so it's better to keep it on as much as possible.

## Method 3: Change the Security Settings

Another way of eliminating annoying Microsoft Edge warnings is by adjusting the security settings within the browser. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Open Microsoft Edge, and click on the three dots at the top-right of the browser.

2. Click on ‘Settings,’ then ‘Privacy, search, and services.’

3. Scroll down and click on ‘Site permissions.’

4. From here, adjust the settings for Notifications, Microphone, Camera, Pop-ups and redirects, and Insecure content.

By changing the settings to your preference, you'll be able to allow or block websites from performing certain actions, thus avoiding annoying warnings and enjoying a better browsing experience.

## Method 4: Use a Different Browser

If you find that the above methods aren't resolving the issue, another possible solution is to switch to another browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Opera. These browsers come with fewer restrictions and may not display the same warnings that Microsoft Edge does. However, keep in mind that this isn't a permanent solution and may not be practical for everyone, particularly those that rely on Microsoft's services.

## Method 5: Use a VPN

Using a VPN protects your privacy by hiding your online activity and encrypting your data. While this may not directly solve your Microsoft Edge warning issue, it will help protect your identity and make it harder for malicious actors to access your computer. In addition, some VPNs come with built-in ad-blocking capabilities that may eliminate some of the warnings.

In conclusion, these are five proven methods that you can use to get rid of annoying Microsoft Edge warnings. By following these steps, you'll be able to browse the internet without interruptions, and enjoy a seamless browsing experience. Try these methods and let us know what works for you.

You have probably just seen a Microsoft warning alert or the Microsoft Trojan warning, here is what you should know about it. 
 
## Learn all you must do after the fake Microsoft alert
 
- Microsoft Edge is one of the world's most popular browsers available, but sometimes you encounter warning alerts.
 - The guide below will show you how to handle the Microsoft warning alerts when you get them on Edge.
 - If you receive a Microsoft Edge security warning, you can try using a safer browser from our list.
 - Before attempting any complex solutions, consider forcing Microsoft Edge to close.

 
- Easy migration: use the Opera assistant to transfer exiting data, such as bookmarks, passwords, etc.
 - Optimize resource usage: your RAM memory is used more efficiently than Chrome does
 - Enhanced privacy: free and unlimited VPN integrated
 - No ads: built-in Ad Blocker speeds up loading of pages and protects against data-mining
 - Download Opera

 
Phishing and online scams, in general, are not as common as they were back in the day. However, since its arrival in the browser market, Microsoft’s pride, Edge, slowly gets the scammers’ attention.
 
One of the most common malicious and fraudulent pop-ups is easily recognizable by the alleged virus alert. This is seemingly a common occurrence in Edge in recent times.
 
This alert, of course, is a nifty way for an online scammer to make you panic and make mistakes.
 
They’ll recommend reaching for help or sending your credentials. Never do that. Stay calm and continue below for a better insight on the topic.
 
## Why am I getting a critical alert from Microsoft?
 
What’s the Edge warning alert?
 
Whenever you see something like this in your browser: Danger! Warning! Brace yourself! Your computer has a serious virus! This is a scamming trick, a treacherous attempt to scare an inexperienced Edge user.
 
Back in the day, Google Chrome and Mozilla were frequently affected by these phishing pop-ups freezing the screen but added security measures almost totally eliminated them.
 
On the other hand, Microsoft Edge is still susceptible to that kind of malicious pop-up.
 
If those scammers get a hold of an unsuspecting user, they can steal your data or Windows license or mislead you to spend tons of money on phone calls. So please don’t fall for it.
 
#### Quick Tip:
 
If scam protection is important to you, then you should use a browser that provides this kind of security. As a solution, we recommend Opera as it has built-in features to increase user safety.
 
With a pop-up blocker, no more ad scams will show up, with unlimited VPN and tracker blocker you can enjoy a private browsing session. It also comes with antimalware software to check every script that might pose a threat.
 
#### Is Microsoft warning alert real?
 
The answer is mostly yes if you still wonder if the Microsoft warning alert is a scam. 
 
###  Opera 
 
  A reliable browser with built-in safety measures that will prevent you from being targeted by malware.  
 
If there’s an imminent threat to your system, you’ll be notified timely by the antivirus or system itself (in case you rely on Windows Security for protection).
 
When something like this appears in Edge, and sometimes it will, we recommend just pressing the Ctrl + Alt + Delete and killing the Microsoft Edge process.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

That’s the first step. Please continue reading to find out how to remove and safeguard against it in the future.
 
## How do I fix Microsoft warning alert?
 
### 1. Force close Microsoft Edge
 
- Press the Windows key + X and select the Task Manager option.
 - Click on the Microsoft Edge process in your Task manager and click the End task button.
 - The next time you start Microsoft Edge, the Microsoft pop-up virus warning should disappear.

 
The next step is to scan for possible browser hijackers, and you can do it with any third-party antivirus at your disposal or with Windows Defender.
 
On the other hand, the sole fact that the antimalware tool hasn’t acquired this as a threat means that you should look at alternatives.
 
A tool like Malwarebytes AdwCleaner is great against PUPs (Potentially Unwanted Programs). It’s completely free, so make sure to download it and give it a try.
 
### 2. Run a full scan
 
- Click the Start menu, type Windows security and click on the Windows Security app.
 - Click on Virus threat and protection.
 - On the next window, select Scan options.
 - Select the Full scan option and click the Scan now button.

 
Rather than use the Windows Security app, as we have shown in this example, you may opt for a third-party antivirus. However, the process of performing a full scan will slightly differ. 
 
We recommend the use of a trusted antivirus because it will protect you from every future malware attack and help maintain your online privacy and security. 
 
### 3. Block Edge pop-ups
 
- Launch the Edge browser.
 - Enter the path below into your Address Bar and click on Enter. edge://settings/content/popups
 - Enable the Block (Recommended) option.

 
This should block the Microsoft warning alert and any future occurrence of it. 
 
### 4. Delete Temp files
 
- Use hotkeys Windows + R to open the Run dialog.
 - Type in the path below and click Enter. %Temp%
 - Select all the files in the folder, right-click and choose the Delete option.

 
### 5. Future proof your Edge surfing endeavors
 
Get an ad-blocking extension from the Microsoft Store as soon as possible now that the Edge supports extensions. Doing this is of utmost importance if you want to avoid false warnings in the future.
 
Besides that, make sure not to allow cookies on all sites and accept them only when prompted from a trusted source.
 
### Would Microsoft ever lock your computer?
 
The Microsoft Has Blocked The Computer error is fake. This is a scam and is not connected with Microsoft in any way. Microsoft will not block your computer. 
 
This Microsoft security alert is an easy way to know that you have been targeted with malicious software. The best way to stay safe is by using a robust antivirus and not clicking any link if the message directs you. 
 
A good antivirus for online protection is also an excellent way to protect from scammers and malware. Good Windows 10 compatible antiviruses have strong firewalls, integrated VPNs, and additional online privacy and safety shields.
