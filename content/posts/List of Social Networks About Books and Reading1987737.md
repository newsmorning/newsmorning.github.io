Avid readers enjoy immersing themselves in a great story and then discussing the book with friends and other book lovers. From book clubs to reading groups, reading has always had a social element, and now social media is playing a role.

 

Book-themed social networks and digital groups are growing more popular, letting participants share good books, discuss great stories, and review the latest bestsellers. Here are six great book-centered social networks for avid readers to check out.
