These two notable gadgets have been the talk of the town ever since their release. With their impressive features and impeccable design, it's hard to resist the temptation and not get your hands on one of them. But the question arises, which one should you choose? In this article, we will uncover the various aspects of both smartphones, hoping to aid you in making a well-informed decision.

Tecno Phantom X, too, does not lag in the camera department. It features a 50MP primary shooter, a 13MP ultra-wide camera, and an 8MP telephoto camera with up to 2x optical zoom. Its front camera is a 48MP camera with a dual-LED flash capability, making sure your selfies appear perfect even in low light conditions.

Earlier this year, Infinix made headlines with their 120W fast charging concept phone which is not what we got on the Infinix Zero X Pro instead Xiaomi’s 11T Pro is the only smartphone so far to have the feature. Then there is the Tecno Phantom X which holds the title of the most expensive Tecno phone and even Transsion phone as of the time this article was written.
 
Both Infinix and Tecno are phone brands under Transsion Holdings and the two have smartphones in the low budget to midrange categories so they are often competitors in the same price segment.
 
Historically, the Infinix’s Zero series and Tecno’s Phantom series are reserved for the best both brands have to offer and that’s the same for the two smartphones discussed here. The Infinix Zero X Pro and the Phantom X represent the pinnacle of smartphone specs and features under the banner of their respective brands.
 
## Infinix Zero X Pro Vs Tecno Phantom X: Design
 
The two smartphones adopt entirely different designs and look. While the Tecno Phantom X has curved glass on both the front and back, the Infinix Zero X Pro adopts an iPhone 13 kind of square box sides. The speaker grills, USB-C port and headphone jack are all at the bottom of both smartphones. 
 
You can see that the two smartphones are going for very different looks with the Phantom X going for a more flashy look and the Infinix Zero X Pro being conservative but still stylish. The Phantom X has a laser-etched back that gives it a textured feel when held and the Zero X Pro has a starry smooth back.

## Infinix Zero X Pro Vs Tecno Phantom X: Display
 
Besides the curved screen, the display on the two phones is almost the same only that the Infinix Zero X Pro screen has a 120Hz refresh rate and the Tecno Phantom X has a 90Hz refresh rate. They both feature a 1080p Super AMOLED display with a side punch hole and central notch on the Phantom X and Zero X Pro respectively. 
 
The Phantom X has a display wrapped around the side of the phone and you have contents of the screen actually spilling to the side forcing the power and volume buttons closer to the back of the phone. The Infinix Zero X Pro display is not curved but it still has slim bezels bordering it although the bezels are bigger compared to what’s on the Phantom X.
 
## Infinix Zero X Pro Vs Tecno Phantom X: Camera
 
Here is where the Infinix Zero X Pro really excels in comparison to the Tecno flagship and is undeniably one of the key selling points of the former. On the back, the Infinix Zero X Pro features a massive 108MP main wide-angle camera with optical image stabilization (OIS), an 8MP 5x optical zoom periscope telephoto camera with OIS and a 120o ultrawide camera. Also, the Phantom X features the same set of cameras but in this case a 50MP main camera, 13MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom and an 8MP 120o ultrawide camera.
 
More so, there is no OIS on the Phantom X while the Zero X Pro has OIS on both the main and telephoto camera which by the way can go up to 60x digital zoom. For the front camera(s), there is a 16MP camera on the Zero X Pro while the Phantom X features the combination of a 48MP main camera and an 8MP ultrawide camera.

## Infinix Zero X Pro Vs Tecno Phantom X: Battery
 
There is a slightly bigger battery on the Phantom X which has a 4700mAh capacity. Elsewhere, the Infinix Zero X Pro comes with a 4500mAh battery which is still enough juice for the average user and about what you will get in most pones anyway. 
 
However, the Infinix ssmartphone has faster charging with a 45W quick charging technology in comparison to the 33W the Phantom X supports.
 
## Infinix Zero X Pro Vs Tecno Phantom X: Security and OS
 
The two smartphones has just about the same security system with the usual PIN, pattern, on-screen fingerprint and face unlock all available here. Nonetheless, the Tecno Phantom X still includes a side fingerprint scanner built into the power button in addition to the on-screen fingerprint scanner. I think the reason for this is that the on-screen fingerprint scanner on the Phantom X is quite relatively slow same as that of the Infinix Zero X Pro which unfortunately does not have any other fingerprint scanner.
 
The Phantom X runs on HiOS 7.6 while the Zero X Pro has XOS 7.6 both based on Android 11. The two Android skin are more or less the same besides the naming as you can see the two even have the same 7.6 versioning.
 
## Spec Sheet Comparison
 
## Conclusion
 
It is obvious that the Infinix Zero X Pro is more camera-centric and it will make more sense if that is what you are looking for in a smartphone. On the other hand, the Phantom X is more aesthetically pleasing with about the same features while still maintaining a decent camera although at a steeper price. 
 
Another considerable difference between these two smartphones is the screen refresh rate which is 90Hz for Phantom X and 120Hz for Zero X Pro and the fact that the latter is cheaper even though they have the same processor.
