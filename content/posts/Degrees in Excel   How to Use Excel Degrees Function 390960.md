In this guide, we'll explore what the DEGREES function does, how to use it, and some tips and tricks to get the most out of this function. So let's dive in!

## What is the DEGREES Function?

The DEGREES function is an in-built mathematical function in Excel that converts radians to degrees. It is a simple yet powerful tool used to simplify complex formulae to calculate angles in degrees. This function takes an angle in radians as its input and converts it to degrees that can be used in other calculations or displayed in your spreadsheet for easy reference.

## How to Use the DEGREES Function?

The syntax for the DEGREES function is straightforward. To use it, simply type the function name followed by an open parenthesis, then the angle you want to convert, and close the parenthesis. Here's what it looks like:

`=DEGREES(angle in radians)`

For example, to convert 1.5708 radians to degrees, we'll use the following formula: 

`=DEGREES(1.5708)`

The result will be 90 degrees.

## Tips and Tricks for Using the DEGREES Function

Now that you know how to use the DEGREES function let's explore some tips and tricks that can help make your work even easier and more efficient.

### 1. Use Cell References

Instead of typing in the angle you want to convert, consider using cell references. This way, if you need to change the value of the angle, you can simply change the value in the cell reference, and the formula will update automatically.

### 2. Combine with Other Functions

You can combine the DEGREES function with other functions to simplify complex calculations. For example, suppose you want to calculate the trigonometric functions of an angle. In that case, you can use the SIN, COS, and TAN functions in conjunction with the DEGREES function to calculate the values in degrees.

### 3. Use Formatting to Make Your Work More Readable

To make your work more readable and professional, consider formatting the cells to display the degree symbol (°). To do this, select the cells with your degree values, right-click, and select format cells. Then, in the number tab, select the custom category, and in the type field, enter "0°". 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the DEGREES function in Excel is a powerful tool that can save you time and simplify complex calculations. To use the DEGREES function, simply type the function name, followed by the angle you want to convert, and close the parenthesis. Remember to use cell references and combine the function with other mathematical functions to take full advantage of its capabilities.

## Degrees Function in Excel
 
The DEGREES function in Excel converts the angles mentioned in radians, which are determined based on the radius of a circle, to degrees. It is one of the mathematical and trigonometric functions inbuilt into Excel to resolve the problem with radians. We first used this function in Microsoft Excel 2000 version.
 
The DEGREES function in Excel is significant to the aspirants who want to gain expertise in all Excel functions.
 
For example, suppose we have 0.2 as radians in column B in the Excel worksheet, and we need to convert it into degrees. In such a scenario, we can use the DEGREES function in Excel. This function converts angles expressed in radians to degrees and will return the result as 11.4591559.
 
### Explanation
 
- Description: The people unaware of mathematics use degrees instead of radians. Mathematicians use radians to make the discussion about the angles in trigonometry to ensure the following best practices.Generally, a circle consists of 360 degrees, equal to 6.28 radians or 2P radians. Here, P is the constant, equivalent to a rounded value of 3.14.The authentic relationship between the radian and degrees is 1 radian = 57.3 degrees.

Manually, radians are converted into degrees by following the below steps.
 
Degrees = (Radians * 180) / PI
 
Let consider Radians =2, PI constant = 3.14
 
Degrees = (2 * 180) / 3.14 = 114.64
 
The DEGREES function in Excel eliminates the need to follow these steps.
