If you are an iPad Pro user, you are likely familiar with the importance of taking good care of your device. From downloading the latest software updates to avoiding water damage, there are many things you can do to keep your iPad Pro functioning properly. However, even the most diligent users can run into problems from time to time.

Recently, a tragic incident occurred when an iPad Pro user attempted to repair their device and ended up causing irreparable damage. The user, who has chosen to remain anonymous, made a fatal error by damaging the device's logic cable ribbon. In this article, we will examine what went wrong and how you can avoid making the same mistake.

Before we dive into the specifics, it's important to understand what the logic cable ribbon is and why it is so important for your device. The logic cable ribbon is a thin, flexible cable that connects the iPad Pro's logic board to the display. This cable allows the device to display images and transmit data between the two components. If this cable is damaged or disconnected, the device will not function properly.

Now, let's take a closer look at the incident in question. In an interview with the user, they explained that they had attempted to replace their iPad Pro's battery themselves. They followed an online tutorial to remove the device's screen and access the battery. However, during the repair process, they accidentally pulled too hard on the logic cable ribbon, causing it to detach from the logic board.

The user attempted to reattach the cable, but unfortunately, they were unsuccessful. They took their device to a professional repair shop, but the damage was already done. The repair technician confirmed that the device was beyond repair due to the damage caused to the logic cable ribbon.

So, what can you learn from this tragic incident? Here are a few takeaways that can help you avoid making the same mistake:

1. Know Your Limits: Unless you are experienced in repairing electronic devices, it's best to leave the repairs to the professionals. Attempting a repair without the proper knowledge and tools can lead to serious damage.

2. Follow Tutorials with Caution: While online tutorials can be helpful, it's important to take them with a grain of salt. Not all tutorials are created equal, and following incorrect instructions can result in irreparable damage.

3. Be Gentle: When handling electronic devices, it's important to be gentle and avoid applying too much force. Tugging on cables or pulling them can cause serious damage.

In conclusion, the fatal error made by the iPad Pro user serves as a reminder of the importance of being careful when attempting repairs on electronic devices. By following the advice outlined in this article, you can avoid making the same mistake and continue to enjoy your iPad Pro for years to come.

 hakki Daryan,
buy a new ribbon tape and solder it in place of the old, broken one. The problem may be finding a new one, think about buying a damaged motherboard and using a donor element. Call repair shops in your area, I'm sure you'll find hundreds, maybe even more, damaged iPad motherboards by technicians for sale.
