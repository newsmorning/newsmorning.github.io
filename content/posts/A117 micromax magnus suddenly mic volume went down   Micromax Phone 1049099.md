You Won't Believe What Happened to My Micromax Magnus! Mic Volume Mysteriously Drops - the Strange Reason Revealed!

I am a proud Micromax Magnus user and have been using it for quite some time now. Recently, however, I noticed a strange issue with my device. The mic volume would mysteriously drop during calls, making it difficult for the person on the other end to hear me clearly. It was a frustrating problem that persisted for several days until I finally decided to investigate the issue.

Initially, I suspected that it might be a hardware problem, but after checking the microphone and the speaker thoroughly, I found they were working just fine. So, I turned my attention towards the software and the applications running on my device. After checking every app installed on my device, I couldn't find any problematic ones.

Then, I came across an interesting solution mentioned in one of the Reddit forums. Apparently, there is a little-known feature on the Micromax Magnus that causes the microphone volume to lower automatically while listening to certain types of music. This feature is known as "Smart Audio" and is intended to balance the volume levels for the optimum listening experience.

What I didn't know was that the "Smart Audio" feature was active during phone calls as well. Whenever the mic detects high-pitched frequencies in the voice, it assumes that it is a shrill sound and lowers the mic volume automatically. This makes it difficult for the person on the other end to hear what I am saying and is the reason for the mysterious reduction in mic volume.

The solution to the problem was simple - to disable the "Smart Audio" feature. To do this, I went to the "Settings" menu, then "Sound" and finally "Smart Audio". Here, I disabled the feature, and voila! The problem was fixed.

In conclusion, if you are a Micromax Magnus user and experiencing a similar issue with mic volume mysteriously dropping, you should check if the "Smart Audio" feature is enabled. Disabling it might be the solution you're looking for. It would be best to familiarize yourself with all the features on your device to avoid any troublesome issues in the future.


## Chosen Solution
 I have been using my a117 for over 2 years. Suddenly the phone mic volume or sensitivity has gone down and no one is no longer able to hear me clearly over the other side of the conversation on my phone. I wanted to know if this is a software or hardware issue. And if it is a hardware issue how can I fix it? I want to clean the mics by opening up my phone. Can anyone provide me a service manual to this phone that tells me how to open it up exactly...... Please I need help with this issue...

 normally a mic issue is hardware.  There should be a tiny hole on the bottom of your phone.  Inspect it to make sure there isn't anything clogging it and clean it out with 99% IPA.  If that doesn't work, you will need to open your phone and inspect the microphone.  Replacing it is not all too complicated, but I don't know of any service manual.
