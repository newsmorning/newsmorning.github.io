However, a faulty power jack can give you headaches as it can lead to power malfunctions, which can cause your laptop to shut down and even damage your battery. In most cases, when a laptop's power jack is defective, it requires soldering to fix it. But with the right guide, you can fix it without the need for a soldering iron.

Don't panic if your laptop power jack is not working. We're here to guide you through the process, step by step, on how to fix your laptop's power jack without soldering. The entire process is easy to understand and will save you time and money.

What You'll Need to Get Started

Before you begin fixing your laptop power jack, ensure you have the following materials:

- A Phillips head screwdriver

- A flat head screwdriver

- A set of pliers

- A hot glue gun

- A pack of glue sticks

- A replacement DC power jack

- Electrical tape

Step 1: Remove The Battery And Adapter

The first step is to unplug your laptop from the power source and remove the battery to prevent any electrical hazards. Remove the screws on the bottom of the laptop and the shield that covers the motherboard. Disconnect the adapter that connects to your motherboard from your DC power jack.

Step 2: Remove The Old Power Jack

Use the pliers to remove the old power jack from your laptop, which will allow you to access the soldering points. Once you've removed the old power jack, clean any dust or debris from the connection point using a flathead screwdriver.

Step 3: Install The New Power Jack

Next, install the new DC power jack in the same orientation as the old one. It should fit snugly into place, and its soldering points should align with those from the previous power jack.

Step 4: Secure The New Power Jack

Apply some hot glue around the edges of the new power jack to secure it, ensuring it does not move around. Use the electrical tape to tape down the wires from the power jack to the motherboard, ensuring they do not stick out or move around.

Step 5: Reassemble Your Laptop

Once you have successfully completed the steps above, reassemble your laptop by replacing the motherboard shield and the screws. Afterward, reconnect your adapter to your DC power jack and your battery. Turn your laptop on, and it should start powering up correctly.

Most importantly, we need access to information on the fly. Many of us travel a lot, therefore we need to organize our time properly in order to keep up with work and deadlines.
 
It is so much easier to do all of these when you have access to a laptop or a notebook. 
 
Completing tasks has never been easier since you can quickly take out your device and start working, either while traveling by train, or by bus.
 
However, your device must function properly. One of the worst problems that you could encounter is running out of battery. 
 
Even more, if your power jack stops working you won’t be able to charge your laptop, consequently being unable to use it. Here is a list of solutions for such an issue.
 
## How can I fix my laptop power jack without soldering it?
 
### 1. Check if your laptop battery is working
 
- Take the battery out of your laptop.
 - Plug your charger in without the battery.
 - Since your laptop is running on AC power, check to see if it works.

 
Sometimes the power jack is not the actual problem. Your laptop might be having a faulty battery. You can check if the battery is the problem by simply removing it and plugging in your power adapter.
 
Without a battery, your device will not be able to run without a constant supply of power. 
 
Do not plug your power adapter from your outlet thinking it will still work, because you will be cutting your laptop’s power supply, thus causing it to turn off.
 
### 2. Check your battery life through CMD
 
- Right-click on Start and select Command Prompt (Admin).
 - Type powercfg energy in the Command Prompt.
 - A file path will appear on the screen. Open windows explorer and go to it.
 - Scroll down until you find the Battery: Battery Information section.
 - Check the Design Capacity and Last Full Charge.
 - Divide the Design Capacity value with the Last Full Charge value, then multiply by 100%.

 
Now you should know how to check your battery’s condition. The higher the percentage, the healthier the battery.
 
If you’re having trouble accessing Command Prompt as an admin, then you better take a closer look at this guide.

### 3. Check the power adapter
 
- Plug your AC adapter in your power outlet.
 - Set the Multimeter to 20V and into DC mode.
 - Use the Multimeter leads and touch the metal parts of the AC adapter connector.
 - The reading you get from your Multimeter should be close to the one written on your Ac adapter.

 
You need to check if your AC adapter isn’t acting up before you try to fix your power jack. 
 
For those who don’t know, a multimeter is a tool used to measure voltages. You can buy the AstroAI Digital Multimeter right away, if you don’t have any on hand already.
 
### 4. Open up your laptop’s case
 
- Take a screwdriver and unscrew your laptop’s case.
 - Take out your battery, RAM, and storage.
 - Make sure there are no screws left holding your case in place.
 - Open up your case and take a look at the power jack.
 - Take the power jack out of its designated socket and put it back in, applying pressure.
 - Put your laptop back together carefully, screwing everything back properly.

 
Disassembling and fiddling with your laptop’s components by yourself is risky. Take matters into your own hands only if you are well informed about laptops. 
 
If you’re not experienced enough, contact a specialist. This last step is the last resort before you start searching for the nearest laptop service. 
 
You need to check the inside of your laptop and make sure that your power jack hasn’t moved. Sometimes the jack will shift its position, thus making the contact with the AC adapter difficult.
 
Constantly look for any physical damage to your power jack. If you find any serious damage that could be preventing a stable connection, it might mean that the power jack is compromise.
 
In such a case, it needs to be replaced, so do not hesitate to seek help from a specialist.
 
These are the ways in which you can repair your power jack if it’s faulty, without needing to solder it.
