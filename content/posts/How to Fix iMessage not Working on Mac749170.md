Here's a step-by-step guide to fix iMessage not working on your Mac:

Step 1: Check your internet connection

The first thing you should do is check your internet connection. iMessage needs a stable internet connection to work correctly. If your internet connection is weak, your iMessage may not work correctly. Ensure you have a stable internet connection before proceeding to the next step.

Step 2: Sign out and sign back in to your iMessage account

The second step is to sign out and sign back in to your iMessage account. Sometimes, signing out and signing back in helps re-establish the connection between your Mac and iMessage servers. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to System Preferences on your Mac
2. Click on Date & Time

Step 4: Reset PRAM/NVRAM

If the above steps fail, the next solution is to reset PRAM/NVRAM. PRAM/NVRAM is a small amount of memory that stores certain settings and preferences. Resetting it can help solve some iMessage issues. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Shut down your Mac
2. Press the power button and hold down Command + Option + P + R keys
3. Release the keys after you hear the startup sound twice
