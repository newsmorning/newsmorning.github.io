As the release date for Horizon Forbidden West approaches, fans of the game franchise are becoming increasingly curious about what new surprises it has in store for them. In this article, we reveal what we discovered about the game's mysterious ancient machines, and trust us, you won't believe what we found!

Our research began with a brief look at the game's trailer, which shows the protagonist, Aloy, discovering a new array of mechanical beasts that were never seen in the first installment. These machines appear to be far more complex and dangerous than their predecessors, indicating that players will have to use more advanced strategies to take them down.

We then delved into the lore behind these machines and discovered that they are remnants of a bygone era, created by an advanced civilization that existed before the events of the game. These machines are part of a larger storyline that involves uncovering the secrets of this lost civilization, and the impact their technology had on the world.

As we dug deeper, we found out that each new machine has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and players will have to uncover these to develop effective combat strategies. For example, one of the new machines is a towering elephant-like creature that can ram into players with devastating force. However, if players can climb on top of this machine, they can use spears to take out its weak points and bring it down.

Another machine that stood out to us is a giant crab-like creature that can release a massive cloud of poisonous gas. Players will have to stay on the move and avoid the creature's attacks while also managing their health, lest they succumb to the gas.

Furthermore, we also found out that the world of Horizon Forbidden West is far larger and more diverse than its predecessor. From underwater ruins to sprawling jungles, the game's environments are more immersive and dynamic than ever before. Players will have to navigate these terrains and discover ancient artifacts that will help them uncover the truth behind the lost civilization.

In conclusion, Horizon Forbidden West is shaping up to be an amazing gaming experience. From the new and dangerous machines to the diverse and immersive environments, players are in for a treat when the game releases later this year. We can't wait to see what other secrets the game has in store for us!

Horizon Forbidden West is out with many new machines for Aloy to slay while still keeping the old ones. If you thought the machines in Zero Dawn were tough or annoying then wait till you meet some of the machines unique to this game. Tremortusk was just one of the glimpses of how fearsome the machines can be in the sequel, and there are many more such machines waiting to meet you. So let us quickly check the list of all the new & returning machines in Horizon Forbidden West.
 
## All New Machines in Horizon Zero Dawn
 

 
- Bristleback: The Bristleback resembles a warthog and might deceive you for a harmless machine. Be wary of its tusks, as they will do some serious damage to Aloy if you ever end up fighting it.
 - Burrower: Burrower is a recon robot underwater that will let out a screech when it spots you. And what comes after the screech is worst as all the other machines are now aware of your location.
 - Clamberjaw: This is a foe that can be found in groups. As it resembles a monkey you can assume it will be fast when it comes to climbing. Their agility and numbers can and will easily put you at a disadvantage.
 - Clawstrider: If you want a new ride then this is one of the coolest machines Aloy can ride. But while they are mountable, they are also very deadly as a foe, the reason being their sharp claws and chainsaws for a mouth.
 - Dreadwing: This is a large bird that does various status effect attacks.
 - Rollerback: What is more dangerous than a rogue killing machine? A Rogue killing machine that turns into a ball to stomp you while launching aerial projectiles that also try to kill you. And this rogue killing machine is Rollerback.
 - Shellsnapper: Ever wanted to see how a Mega evolved Torterra would look like when given the RTX treatment? If the answer was yes, then Shellsnapper has you covered. This turtle shows none of your typical turtle traits of being cute, slow, and harmless. And is ready to kill you without any second thoughts.
 - Slitherfang: What do normal snakes and Slitherfang have in common? Their ability to spew poison, or in the case of Slitherfang, acid. But unlike your regular snakes, Slitherfang is huge, is a robot, and actively trying to kill you.
 - Sunwing: These pterodactyl-like birds harness the power of the sun using their wings!
 - Tideripper: Tideripper is a beast that will not only chase you in the depths of the water but also come after you on land.
 - Tremortusk: If you like Mammoths then you are in for a treat as Guerrilla Games have their Mecha Mammoths ready to take you down. But unlike your usual Mammoths these feature 4 tusks, flamethrowers, and other deadly weapons to attack you with.
 - Widemaw: This is another new machine with deadly tusks. Widemaw is based on a Hippo.
