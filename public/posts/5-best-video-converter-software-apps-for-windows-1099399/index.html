Do you struggle with video compatibility issues? Not to worry, there are numerous video converter software apps available that can solve all your video-related problems. In this article, we will be discussing the top 5 video converter software apps that are taking Windows 10 by storm.\nBody:\nFreemake Video Converter: Freemake Video Converter is a versatile and easy-to-use video converter software app. It supports a wide range of video formats, including AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPEG, 3GP, DVD, Blu-ray, and more.

It also includes a built-in video editor that allows you to trim, crop, and add special effects to your videos. Any Video Converter also supports batch conversion, which means you can convert multiple videos at once.

It also includes a built-in video editor that allows you to trim, crop, and add special effects to your videos. Aiseesoft Video Converter Ultimate also supports batch conversion, which means you can convert multiple videos at once. With its high-quality output and fast conversion speed, Aiseesoft Video Converter Ultimate is a popular choice among Windows 10 users.\nConclusion:\nThese are the top 5 video converter software apps that are taking Windows 10 by storm. Each software app has its unique features and benefits, but they all share one thing in common: they can convert any video format to another format quickly and efficiently. Whether you’re looking to watch your favorite videos on different devices or edit your videos, these video converter software apps can help you achieve your goals.\nStreaming platforms like YouTube and Netflix make video seem easy, but as soon as you have to start working with the medium yourself, things are very different. There are a lot of different video codecs, and a heap of settings you can tune within each one. So when you need to convert a video from one format to another, it can feel like drawing in jargon. That’s where a good video converter software package comes into play. We’ve pulled together some of the best examples from both paid and free options, to make your next video conversion job as easy as pie.\nWhat We Want From Video Converter Software for Windows In evaluating video conversion software, there are a few things we look out for:\nThe range of codecs and conversion options on offer.How easy the software is to use for users of different levels.How fast the software is and how well it uses your hardware. These are the most important aspects of any video converter, but we’ll also deduct points for a few things as well:\nExtremely intrusive ads.Ugly user interfaces.Unstable or buggy operation. These are six pretty straightforward criteria, so let’s get to the meat and potatoes with some juicy, bite-size reviews.\nAicoosoft Video Converter We’ll admit that the poor quality of the English website copy on the Aicoosoft website would give anyone pause. However, plenty of excellent utility developers aren’t from English regions. So one can be a little forgiving when it comes to the odd language slipup.\nThere is no free version of this video converter, but you can try it for free before paying anything. You can choose to pay an annual license or, for a little more, buy a lifetime license.\nOne interesting feature of Aicoosoft’s converter is the inclusion of a screen recorder. We’re not sure who really needs this feature though. For Windows PCs there are open source options, such as Open Broadcast Software. If you have a GPU from Nvidia or AMD, you also have their screen capture software.\nIf you’re using macOS, then there’s a fantastic built-in screen recorder just a keypress away. That’s not the main value proposition of this software though. Aicoosoft promises video conversion without quality loss and fast conversion making use of both GPU acceleration and multi-core CPU use.\nDoes it deliver? With GPU acceleration on, it converted our three minute 4K test clip to 720p in 45 seconds. That’s more than three times faster than realtime! Checking the result visually, we couldn’t see any problems. So it passes with flying colors and works just as advertised.\nRating 5/5\nANVsoft Any Video Converter Free The free version of Any Video Converter is probably more software than most people will ever need. The paid Pro version offers extended support for mobile devices and the ability to create DVD menus. However, most users really have no use for the extra features of the paid version. In fact, you quickly forget that you’re using a freeware version with limited functions.\nAny Video converter has a great interface, tons of ready-made templates, excellent batch conversion and only takes a minute or two to figure out. The only real negative we have to say about this excellent free package is that there are too many presets to trawl through. It might be time to move some of the obsolete presets into a separate menu so that more relevant ones are easier to find.\nCompressing our 4K clip to 720p worked perfectly and it was actually done a little faster than the Aicoosoft solution. The output quality was a little worse to the eye and the file was slightly larger in comparison, but taking the zero price tag into consideration it’s a fantastic deal.\nRating 4/5\nHandbrake Handbrake is the secret video conversion weapon spoken about in hushed tones among geeks. The reason Handbrake reached an almost cult-status was its ability to rip DVD discs, shredding the copy protection without so much as a hiccup.\nThese days ripping discs isn’t something most people need to do, but Handbrake is an excellent general-purpose video conversion package. The software has developed a reputation as being a little too technical for the average user. To be honest, that’s not a totally unfair assessment. However, if you take a few minutes to watch some instructional videos on YouTube, you’ll gain access to one of the most powerful video conversion engines in existence.\nThat being said, when actually doing a simple operation such as converting our 4K test clip to 720p, it wasn’t that hard to figure out. We simply used the 720p “fast” preset for general use. The output quality was perfectly fine, but it took much longer than the other converters to complete the job, doing it at about real time video speed.\nRating 3/5\nDivX Converter Unlike the other conversion software packages, DivX Converter is part of a larger suite which includes Player and Media Server. There’s both a Free and Pro version of the software with some high-end features reserved for the Pro version.\nIf you pay the asking price, the advertising goes away. You can also connect your Google Drive and Dropbox accounts, expand codec support and access high-fidelity audio standards. For most people however, the free version will be just fine. You’d expect a DivX converter to only convert videos to DivX, but you can create H.264 and HEVC videos as well. It’s one of the most streamlined apps here and if you just want something that works easily and will be compatible with just about any device, it’s a good choice.\nWe are going to deduct a point from DivX for trying to sneak extra software installations in its installation Wizard. Also, the software constantly asked for admin privileges every time it has to do a conversion. That’s very annoying indeed!\nThe output quality was great and the conversion didn’t take long at all. The application is also dead-simple to use overall.\nPrism Video Converter Before we talk about Prism Video Converter itself, we need to clear the air a little. At one point this software was found to contain unwanted drive-by downloads. While not outright malicious, some of these unwanted add-ons included things like browser toolbars. Ouch.\nThe good news is that, since 2015, Prism is certified parasite-free. So you don’t have to worry about that anymore.\nAs for the software itself, it has a very unassuming interface. Despite claims by NCH software that Prism is one of the easiest packages to use, we found it a little hard to figure out. Especially compared to Any Video Converter or DivX Converter.\nOnce we found the right options for conversion when digging through the menus, it took about a minute and a half to convert our 4K, three-minute clip. The output quality was also pretty good!\nHave You Been Converted? There are so many options out there for video conversion software on desktop systems that it can feel like a full-time job just to pick one. Then you have to grapple with the complexity of the video conversion, hoping that your output will look good, work well and take up no more space than it needs to.\nThese five video converter software apps for Windows 10 each have their own strengths and weaknesses compared to one another. However, we think each is a worthy choice as long as it matches your particular needs. Whether you just need to batch convert some old holiday videos that won’t play anymore or you’re working on a professional project, there’s sure to be a perfect choice among these.\n","wordCount":"1787","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Harold Richardson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-best-video-converter-software-apps-for-windows-1099399/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How These 5 Video Converter Software Apps Are Taking Windows 10 By Storm!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 21, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1787 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Harold Richardson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#what-we-want-from-video-converter-software-for-windows>What We Want From Video Converter Software for Windows</a></li><li><a href=#aicoosoft-video-converter>Aicoosoft Video Converter</a></li><li><a href=#anvsoft-any-video-converter-free>ANVsoft Any Video Converter Free</a></li><li><a href=#handbrake>Handbrake</a></li><li><a href=#divx-converter>DivX Converter</a></li><li><a href=#prism-video-converter>Prism Video Converter</a></li><li><a href=#have-you-been-converted>Have You Been Converted?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe How These 5 Video Converter Software Apps Are Taking Windows 10 By Storm!</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Are you tired of not being able to watch your favorite videos on Windows 10?
