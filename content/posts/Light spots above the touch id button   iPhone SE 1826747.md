You Won't Believe What Apple Hid Above the iPhone SE Touch ID Button!

When Apple released the iPhone SE in 2020, it was widely regarded as a budget-friendly alternative to the more expensive flagship iPhones. But what many people didn't realize is that the iPhone SE actually hides a secret feature that not many people are aware of.

If you take a closer look at the home button of your iPhone SE, you may notice a small LED light that sits just above the Touch ID sensor. This LED isn't just for show, as it actually plays an important role in helping you use your iPhone more efficiently and effectively.

The LED light is known as the "Breathing Light," and it's designed to help you know when your iPhone is charging, fully charged or in Low Power Mode. When you connect your iPhone SE to a power source, the LED light will flash once to indicate that it's charging. Once your iPhone is fully charged, the LED light will stay on continuously.

If your iPhone SE is running low on battery, you can enable Low Power Mode to help conserve energy. When you turn on Low Power Mode, the Breathing Light will flash on and off at a slower pace, letting you know that your iPhone is conserving power.

While the Breathing Light feature may seem like a small addition, it's a great example of how Apple goes above and beyond to make using their products an enjoyable experience. It's also a great reminder that there are often hidden features and functionalities of electronics that you may not be aware of.

In addition to the Breathing Light, the iPhone SE also features a powerful A13 Bionic chip and a 4.7-inch Retina HD display, making it a formidable option for those who want a more affordable iPhone without sacrificing performance or quality.

So the next time you're using your iPhone SE, take a moment to appreciate the small but significant features that make it such a great device. And remember, sometimes the most exciting features are the ones that are hiding in plain sight.

## Chosen Solution
 I changed the display to the iphone se (1st gen) and now when I open a dark window above the touch button id I see some light spots.
Hereâ€™s the picture:

 Are the light spots on the display right above the Touch ID? or is it coming from the Touch ID area itself?
