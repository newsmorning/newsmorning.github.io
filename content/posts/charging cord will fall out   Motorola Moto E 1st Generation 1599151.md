If you own a first-generation Motorola Moto E, you may have noticed that the charging cable doesn't always stay in place. This can be a frustrating experience, as it can interrupt your charging cycle and even cause damage to your phone. In this article, we'll explain why your charging cord may be popping out, and what you can do to prevent it.

**Why Is Your Charging Cord Popping Out?**

The reason why your charging cord keeps popping out of your Moto E phone is that the charging port's inner tab becomes worn over time. The tab is what holds your charging cord in place, and if it becomes worn or weak, your charging cord can quickly become loose from the phone.

Another possible reason could be the cord itself. If the charging cord feels loose or wobbly when plugged in, it may be because it's becoming worn out. Generally, cables tend to become frayed and damaged near the ends.

**What Can You Do to Prevent Your Charging Cord from Popping Out?**

Now that you know why your charging cord is popping out, let's explore what can be done to prevent it from happening.

- Use a higher-quality cable: Using a higher-quality charging cable can help to reduce the amount of wear and tear on your charging port. Invest in a sturdy braided cable that is designed to bend more and be more durable than your average charging cord.

- Use a charging dock: A charging dock is a great accessory to help support your phone while it charges. The dock will help to alleviate the pressure on the charging port, preventing it from becoming loose or damaged.

- Be Gentle: When plugging your charging cord in or unplugging, be gentle. Don't jerk the cord or wiggle it around, as this can put unnecessary stress on the charging port.

- Avoid Overcharging: Overcharging your phone can cause battery damage, which can increase the chance of your charging cord popping out. Make sure to unplug your phone once it's fully charged.

**In Conclusion**

If you own a first-generation Motorola Moto E and are experiencing charging cord issues, know that you're not alone. By following the preventative measures we've discussed, you can help to keep your charging cord in place and your phone charged up.

By using a higher-quality cable, using a charging dock, being gentle when plugging in your cord, and avoiding overcharging your phone, you can help to reduce the wear and tear on your charging port, and extend the life of your Moto E phone.

## Chosen Solution
 When I place the charging cord in it will not lock in the port.

 Have you tried using a different cable? It sounds like the small clips that hold the cable in place may be damaged.

 Charging ports experience a lot of traffic in plugging and unplugging. Most likely in this situation the charging port has become “worn out” in that the connection may have experienced some slight bending or rather become “warped” and now can no longer hold the cord in place properly. The best fix for this would be to replace the charging port and the connection will be as it should. However in some cases the repair cost can outweigh the cost of getting a new device. Hope this helps.
