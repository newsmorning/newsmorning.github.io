Introduction
The Hyundai Accent is known for its reliability and affordability. However, over time, the performance of a car can start to decrease due to wear and tear. One of the components that can impact the performance of your Hyundai Accent is the oxygen sensor. In this article, we will be discussing the importance of the oxygen sensor and how replacing it can revive the performance of your car.

What is an Oxygen Sensor?
The oxygen sensor is an essential component of your car's engine. It is responsible for measuring the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas and sending this information to the vehicle's computer. Based on this information, the computer adjusts the air/fuel mixture to optimize combustion and reduce emissions. If the oxygen sensor fails, it will cause a decrease in fuel efficiency, drivability and may trigger the check engine light.

Why Replace the Oxygen Sensor?
Over time, the oxygen sensor can become contaminated with soot, oil or other substances that can affect its ability to work correctly. When this happens, the sensor may start to malfunction, resulting in poor engine performance, rough idling, reduced fuel efficiency, and higher emissions. Replacing the oxygen sensor can improve your car's performance and fuel efficiency by up to 40%.

How to Replace Your Oxygen Sensor
Replacing the oxygen sensor on your Hyundai Accent is a simple task that can be done by most car owners. To replace the oxygen sensor, you will need to follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Locate the Oxygen Sensor
The oxygen sensor is located in the exhaust pipe, near the engine. You may need to get under the car to access it properly.

Step 2: Disconnect the Electrical Connector
Remove the electrical connector from the oxygen sensor by pressing the tab and pulling it out.

Step 3: Loosen the Sensor Using a Wrench
Use a wrench or special oxygen sensor socket to loosen the sensor, turning it counterclockwise.

Step 4: Remove the Old Sensor
Once you have loosened the oxygen sensor, unscrew it and remove it from the vehicle.

Step 5: Install the New Sensor
Install the new oxygen sensor by screwing it into the same location where you removed the original one. Make sure it is tight but do not over-tighten it.

Step 6: Reconnect the Electrical Connector
Reconnect the electrical connector to the oxygen sensor by pushing it back into place until it clicks.

Conclusion
If you have noticed a decrease in the performance of your Hyundai Accent, it may be time to replace the oxygen sensor. Replacing the oxygen sensor is a simple task that can be done by most car owners. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can revive your car's performance and improve fuel efficiency, making your Hyundai Accent perform like a brand new car.

## Introduction
 
This fix will involve finding the sensor, unplugging it, unthreading it, and reinstalling  a new sensor in its place.
 
Reminder: Engine bays are usually very dirty so a pair of work gloves or even non latex style medical gloves can make clean up easier.  Thinner gloves are better for dexterity since there is a small plug to manipulate.
 
Reminder: More lighting is never a bad thing. Headlights, a friend holding a flashlight, or magnetic lights, while not a requirement, will definitely help.
 
## What you need

Step 1

                  Oxygen Sensor               


 
- 
 - Never work on a hot vehicle. Allow your car to cool for at least 4 hours before performing maintenance.
 - 
 - Never work on any automotive electronics without first disconnecting the negative (-) terminal.
 - 
 - Use a 10 mm wrench to loosen bolt on the battery's negative (-) cable, then slide it off the (-) negative post.

Step 2


 
- 
 - Locate the sensor off the exhaust header and follow the wire up to the connector.
 - 
 - Some of the pieces on the top-front of the engine are sharp; be careful what you lean on.
 - 
 - Gently work the connector out of the bracket, then disconnect it by pressing the tab inward then pulling out.
 - 
 - Plastic gets brittle over time. Be gentle and go slow.  If it's not coming out, take a break and come back a little later. Be patient to avoid damage.

- 
 - Gently pull the wire out of its bracket.
 - 
 - It will lift out of the bracket with minimal effort.

Step 4


 
- 
 - Place the 7/8" (22 mm) socket around the O2 sensor. Use a ratchet and 6" extension to loosen and remove the sensor.
 - 
 - Place the socket on the sensor without the ratchet in the way. Once the socket is in place, reattach the ratchet and loosen.
 - 
 - The sensor is behind the exhaust, up against the firewall. Having a headlamp, or a friend who can hold a flashlight, is a big help. The red lights in these photos are cheap magnetic lights!

Step 5


 
- 
 - The sensor can now be unthreaded by hand.
 - 
 - When installing the new O2 sensor, if you feel extreme resistance, STOP. It means it is cross threaded. It should easily thread in by hand.
 - 
 - Use the 7/8" (22 mm) socket to tighten the sensor firmly so it doesn't loosen from vibration.
 - 
 - The last picture is what the whole sensor looks like out in the open.

Step 6


 
- 
 - Reconnect the plug by firmly pushing the plugs together.
 - 
 - Depending on the age of the plastic, you may or may not hear a click; just follow where the two plugs meet. There should be almost no gap.
 - 
 - Push the connector back into its bracket.
 - 
 - You may need to slightly wiggle the connector as you seat it into its bracket. It will be a tight fit by design.
 - 
 - Push the wires back into the metal brackets.
