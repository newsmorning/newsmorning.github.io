Livedrive cloud storage has been a popular storage solution for several years now. With its reputation for fast upload and download speeds and affordable plans, it's no surprise that users have come to rely on Livedrive for their cloud storage needs. In the latest announcement, Livedrive has revealed some of its revolutionary new features set to launch in 2023. But are these features worth the hype?

## Smart Syncing
One of the most anticipated features of the new Livedrive version is Smart Syncing. This feature is designed to provide users with local access to their files while keeping them securely stored in the cloud. With Smart Syncing, users can save valuable space on their hard drives by only syncing the files they need to use regularly. This can be a huge advantage for users who deal with large files, especially those who work with images, videos, or music.

## Rapid Restore
Another feature that Livedrive is introducing in 2023 is Rapid Restore. This feature is designed to provide users with fast and efficient file restoration. With Rapid Restore, users can quickly restore files that have been deleted or lost due to a computer crash or hardware failure. This can be lifesaving for users who depend heavily on their data, such as business owners, students, or researchers.

## Customizable Backups
Livedrive is all about making cloud storage easy for everyone. In 2023, the company is introducing Customizable Backups. This feature will allow users to select which files and folders they want to back up, giving them complete control over their data backup process. This can be a great advantage for users who prefer not to back up every single file on their computer, but only those they need the most.

## Is it Worth the Hype?
While Livedrive's new features are impressive, many users are wondering if they're worth the hype. The answer is yes. Livedrive has always been a reliable cloud storage provider, and the new features only make it better. Smart Syncing, Rapid Restore, and Customizable Backups will provide users with more control over their data while making storage and access simple and fast.

## Pricing
Livedrive offers several plans that cater to different needs. Their Home plan starts at £4.99/month and provides unlimited cloud storage. The Business plan starts at £25/month and offers users an impressive 2 terabytes of storage. Additional options include the Reseller plan, the Briefcase plan, and the FTP Backup plan. Users can choose the plan that suits their needs, making Livedrive a flexible option for those on a tight budget.

## Conclusion
Livedrive has proven to be a reliable and affordable cloud storage provider for years. The new features set to launch in 2023 are only going to make it better. Smart Syncing, Rapid Restore, and Customizable Backups will provide users with more control over their data, making storage and access fast and simple. With affordable plans, Livedrive is an excellent option for those looking for a reliable, easy-to-use cloud storage solution.

Livedrive is an online backup service with two unlimited backup plans to choose from, both of which can be customized and fine-tuned to work best for your setup.

 

You might not have heard much about Livedrive but they've been in business since 2008 and have over 1 million customers.

 

If Livedrive seems like something you may be interested in, keep reading for more details on the plans it offers, the features you'll be able to take advantage of, and our thoughts on how it worked for me.

 
##   Livedrive Plans & Costs  
 

Valid January 2023

 

Livedrive offers two unlimited backup plans:

 
###   Livedrive Backup  
 

This is the least expensive plan you can buy from Livedrive. It offers an unlimited amount of space to back up as many files as you'd like from one computer.

 

Livedrive Backup runs $8.99 /month, or $7.50 /month if you opt for the yearly plan ($89.90).

 
###   Livedrive Pro Suite  
 

Livedrive Pro Suite also supports an unlimited amount of backup space, but it lets you back up up to 5 computers instead of just one.

 

Livedrive Pro Suite is $25 /month. The yearly plan is $240, making the monthly equivalent $20 /month.

 

Pro Suite also includes a built-in plan called Briefcase, which gives you 5 TB of cloud space you can use for storing files online.

 

The difference between Briefcase and the regular backup feature of Pro Suite is that the files aren't backed up automatically. Instead, you treat Briefcase like another hard drive attached to your computer, and everything you copy to it is uploaded to your 5 TB account.

 

Files and folders you put in your Briefcase automatically copy to the other computers you have attached to your account. Plus, you can share files from your Briefcase with anyone you like, and easily copy files from your Pro Suite account into your Briefcase.

 

Livedrive Briefcase can be purchased outside the Pro Suite plan, or even in addition to the Backup plan, but it's not a true backup service in and of itself. If you purchase this alone, you get 2 TB of space for $16 /month (or $13 /month if you pay $156 for a year at once), otherwise it comes with 5 TB of storage as part of Pro Suite.

 

Livedrive Business is another plan offered by Livedrive that's aimed for the whole office with support for cloud collaboration, more users, lots of cloud storage space, file sharing, a central admin control panel, FTP access, and more.

 

Livedrive doesn't have a free backup plan, but any of its paid plans can be tried for a period of 14 days before you commit to buying a subscription to the service. Payment information is required to activate the trial, but you aren't charged until the trial runs out.

 

If you're new to online backup and would like to try out a free plan first, see our list of free online backup plans for some of those.

 
##   Livedrive Features  
 

Files you back up with Livedrive will immediately begin uploading to your online account with unlimited space to hold it all, which is exactly how a backup service should be.

 

Here are more features you can find in Livedrive's plans:

 
##   Our Experience with Livedrive  
 

Livedrive isn't the cheapest backup service you can buy, but it does have a nice collection of features. Plus, the flexibility of the plans should make it easy to find one that works well for you.

 

However, as with everything, there are some pros and cons you'll need to weigh before deciding whether you should buy a Livedrive plan.

 
###   What We Like  
 

First and foremost, we really like that you can back up folders to Livedrive from the right-click context menu in Windows Explorer. This makes backing up easier than having to open the settings and then select the folders you want to upload.

 

While Livedrive is backing up your files, you can tell it to suspend backing up the one it's currently uploading in case it's taking too long, which is handy. It's also useful if you don't necessarily care to back up that particular file right away, and would rather open up that upload room for something more important.

 

While uploading files through our Livedrive account, we noticed it was using the max speed we allowed the program to use (through the bandwidth controls). Overall, in our experience, uploading data to Livedrive was as speedy as most other backup services we've used.

 

Something else we like about Livedrive is their mobile apps. If you've backed up music to your account, you can use the built-in music player to find all your music files and play them back right from the app. Documents, images, and videos can also be viewed and streamed through the app, which most people will probably appreciate.

 

You can even set up your mobile device to automatically back up your images and videos, which is great if you like to keep your mobile media files backed up.

 
###   What We Don't Like  
 

The first thing we should mention is that you can only back up folders with Livedrive. What this means is that you can't select an entire hard drive, nor can you choose single files, to back up. The program only lets you select folders.

 

This means if you want to back up an entire hard drive, you have to place a check next to the folders at its root to ensure all the files inside those folders are actually backed up.

 

Something else we don't like is that Livedrive doesn't back up every single file that you tell it to, which is different from some similar backup services that do back up all files, no matter their file extension.

 

Cookies, browser cache files, settings files, virtual machine files, application data, temporary files, and some system files are permanently disabled from being backed up. This means there's a handful of files Livedrive won't back up for you, which is worth understanding before you commit to a backup plan.

 

We also don't like that Livedrive supports keeping only 30 versions of your files. This means after 30 edits of any particular file, the older ones will begin to delete from Livedrive's servers, which means you can't rely on an unlimited number of versions of your files like you can with some other backup services.

 

Livedrive also only keeps deleted files for 30 days. This means whether you delete the file from your computer, or simply remove the drive that the file was originally located at, you'll only have 30 days before it's permanently irrecoverable from your backups.

 

When restoring files with Livedrive, you, unfortunately, can't use the web app to download folders, as it only supports restoring files. For restoring folders, you have to use the desktop program.

 

Something else to think about before choosing Livedrive is that some users have reported that the Livedrive support team isn't so great at responding to issues you might be having with the service. This could be completely subjective, but it's something to think about nonetheless.

 
##   Final Thoughts on Livedrive  
 

We think Livedrive is a great choice if you're looking for a combination of features that you just can't find in a higher-rated plan, especially if you'd like to include a cloud storage-type addition (i.e. Livedrive Briefcase).
