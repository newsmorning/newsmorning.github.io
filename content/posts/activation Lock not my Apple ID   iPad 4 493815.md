Introduction
------------------
If you recently purchased an iPad 4 or received it as a gift, you might face some trouble with the Activation Lock. The Activation Lock is a security feature that prevents anyone from using an iPad 4 that is not linked to the correct Apple ID. If your iPad 4 is linked to the wrong Apple ID, you won't be able to access any of its features. In this article, we will teach you how to fix this problem.

Step 1: Check the Activation Lock Status of Your iPad 4
--------------------------------------------------------------
You must first verify if your iPad 4 has an Activation Lock enabled. Switch on your iPad 4 and follow these steps.
1. Go to the "Settings" app.
2. Click "iCloud."
3. Look for "Find My iPad" and check whether it is on. 
If Find My iPad is enabled, your iPad 4 contains an Activation Lock, and you will not be able to use it with another Apple ID.

Step 2: Check If Your iPad 4 is Linked to the Correct Apple ID
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Verify that your iPad 4 is linked to the correct Apple ID. You must use the same Apple ID that you used when you first set up your iPad 4. Follow these steps to check.
1. Go to the "Settings" app.
2. Click "iTunes & App Store."
3. Look at the "Apple ID" at the top of the screen.
If the Apple ID displayed matches the one you used to set up your iPad 4, then it is already linked to the correct Apple ID.

Step 3: Unlink Your iPad 4 from the Wrong Apple ID
-----------------------------------------------------
If you've found that your iPad 4 is linked to the wrong Apple ID, you'll need to unlink it first. Follow these steps to unlink it.
1. Go to the "Settings" app.
2. Click on "iTunes & App Store."
3. Click on your Apple ID.
4. Choose "Sign Out."
Your iPad 4 is now unlinked from the wrong Apple ID.

Step 4: Link Your iPad 4 to the Correct Apple ID
--------------------------------------------------
After unlinking your iPad 4, you will now need to link it to the correct Apple ID. Follow these steps to link it.
1. Go to the "Settings" app.
2. Click on "iTunes & App Store."
3. Click "Sign in."
4. Enter the correct username and password combination associated with your Apple ID.
Your iPad 4 is now linked to the correct Apple ID.

Conclusion
--------------
With the above guide, you can unlink your iPad 4 from the wrong Apple ID and link it to the correct Apple ID. By doing so, you will avoid any issues with the Activation Lock and be able to use your iPad 4 as intended. If you face any problem in following the above steps, contact Apple Support for more help.

## Chosen Solution
 I don't know who Apple ID is locking me out of my ipad 4. I thought I set it up. Apple Store wasn't any help. Screen say Activation Lock

 If you don't know the Apple ID accociated with the device, then any effort to use it will be futile. The only thing you can try to do is contact the original owner and ask them to turn off Find My iPad - assuming that the iPad isn't lost of stolen, of course.
