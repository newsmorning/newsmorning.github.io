# Discover the Shocking Truth: Income Statement VS Balance Sheet! Top 5 Crucial Differences with Real-life Example!

If you're new to accounting or running a business, you may find it confusing distinguishing between an income statement and a balance sheet. Both are important financial statements that reveal the financial health of a company, but they have distinct differences. In this article, we'll explore the differences between an income statement and a balance sheet, including their purpose, content, and format, using a real-life example.

## What is an Income Statement?

An income statement, also known as a profit and loss statement, reports a company's revenues, expenses, and net income or loss for a specific period, typically monthly, quarterly, or annually. It shows how much money the company made or lost during that period and breaks down the sources of revenue and expenses.

An income statement is essential for business owners and investors because it helps identify trends and areas of opportunity or concern. For example, it may show that revenue is growing while expenses are stable, resulting in an increase in net income.

## What is a Balance Sheet?

A balance sheet, also known as a statement of financial position, summarizes a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time, typically the end of a month, quarter, or year. It shows what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what remains (equity). A balance sheet is essential for business owners and investors because it provides an overview of the company's financial health and its ability to pay its debts.

## Top 5 Crucial Differences between Income Statement and Balance Sheet

1. **Purpose:** The income statement reflects a company's financial performance over a specified period, while the balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company's financial position at a particular point in time.
2. **Content:** The income statement includes revenue, expenses, gains, and losses, while the balance sheet includes assets, liabilities, and equity.
3. **Format:** The income statement is presented in a chronological order of revenues less expenses, resulting in net income or loss. The balance sheet is presented in a vertical format, listing assets, liabilities, and equity.
4. **Frequency:** The income statement is typically prepared monthly, quarterly, or annually, while the balance sheet is prepared at the end of each month, quarter, or year.
5. **Timeframe:** The income statement reflects a specific period, while the balance sheet reflects a single point in time.

## Real-life Example: Apple Inc.

Let's take a look at Apple Inc.'s income statement and balance sheet for the fiscal year ending September 26, 2020, as reported in its annual report.

### Income Statement

Apple Inc. generated total net sales of $274.5 billion for the fiscal year ending September 26, 2020. The company's operating expenses, including research and development, selling, general, and administrative expenses, totaled $60.7 billion. As a result, Apple Inc. reported a net income of $57.4 billion.

### Balance Sheet

The balance sheet for the fiscal year ending September 26, 2020, shows that Apple Inc. had total assets of $323.9 billion, including cash and marketable securities of $191.83 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $15.4 billion, and property, plant, and equipment of $37.3 billion. The company's liabilities were $105.3 billion, including accounts payable and accrued expenses of $56.07 billion, deferred revenue of $6.5 billion, and long-term debt of $99.7 billion. As a result, Apple Inc.'s shareholders' equity was $218.6 billion.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between the income statement and balance sheet is crucial for anyone involved in accounting or business finance. The income statement shows a company's financial performance over time, while the balance sheet shows a company's financial position at a specific point in time. Both statements work together to provide a complete view of a company's financial health. Use this knowledge to make informed decisions about investing or running a business.

### Income Statement vs. Balance Sheet Format
 
We will explain how the items are being arranged in both income statements and balance sheets, and then we will look at a pictorial representation of them.
 
#### Format of Income Statement
 
- First, we will start with “total sales/ revenue.” Total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the total units produced with the price per unit. This is called “gross revenue.” From gross revenue, sales returns/discounts are being deducted, giving us “net revenue.”After that, we will include “cost of sales”The costs directly attributable to the production of the goods that are sold in the firm or organization are referred to as the cost of sales.read more which is the cost directly related to sales. After deducting the “cost of sales” from the “net revenue,” we will get “gross profit/ loss.”Operating expenses are expenses that are not directly related to sales. From “gross profit/ loss,” operating expenses (selling & administrative expenses, personnel salaries, research & development expenses, etc.) would be deducted. Then, we will also deduct the depreciation from the gross profit/ loss. Deducting operating and depreciation expenses from gross profit/ loss would give us operating profit or EBIT (Earnings/ Loss before interest and taxes). depreciation expensesDepreciation ExpensesDepreciation is a systematic allocation method used to account for the costs of any physical or tangible asset throughout its useful life. Its value indicates how much of an asset’s worth has been utilized. Depreciation enables companies to generate revenue from their assets while only charging a fraction of the cost of the asset in use each year.
