Are you struggling with debt? Do you find yourself overwhelmed and stressed out by your monthly payments? You’re not alone. Millions of people around the world are struggling with debt, and it’s not easy to know where to turn for help.\nBut there is one powerful debt consolidation hack that can help you say goodbye to debt forever.\nWhat is Debt Consolidation?\nDebt consolidation is a process of combining multiple debts into one loan. Instead of making multiple payments each month, you make one payment to a lender who pays off all of your debts.\nThe benefits of debt consolidation are numerous. Not only does it simplify your payments, but it can also save you money in the long run. You may be able to secure a lower interest rate on your consolidated loan, which can save you thousands of dollars over time.\nBut how do you know if debt consolidation is right for you? And how do you calculate your loan consolidation?\nThe Loan Consolidation Calculation\nBefore you can decide if debt consolidation is right for you, you need to calculate your loan consolidation. Here’s how to do it in three easy steps:\nStep 1: Make a List of Your Debts\nYour first step is to make a list of all of your debts. Include the creditor, outstanding balance, and interest rate for each one.\nFor example:\nCredit Card A: $5,000 balance, 18% interest rate Credit Card B: $10,000 balance, 22% interest rate Car Loan: $15,000 balance, 7% interest rate Student Loan: $20,000 balance, 5% interest rate\nStep 2: Determine Your Consolidation Loan Amount\nNext, determine the amount of your consolidation loan. This is the amount you’ll need to pay off all of your debts.\nTo do this, add up the outstanding balances of all of your debts. In our example, you would add $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, and $20,000 for a total of $50,000.\nStep 3: Estimate Your Interest Rate\nFinally, estimate what interest rate you would qualify for on a consolidation loan. You can do this by researching rates from different lenders or talking to a financial advisor.\nFor our example, let’s say you can qualify for a consolidation loan with an interest rate of 10%.\nSo, to consolidate all of your debts into one loan, you would need a loan for $50,000 with a 10% interest rate.\nIs Debt Consolidation Right for You?\nNow that you know how to calculate your loan consolidation, you can determine if debt consolidation is right for you.\nIf your consolidated loan has a lower interest rate than your current debts, you could save thousands of dollars over time. And if you’re struggling to keep up with multiple payments each month, consolidating your debts can simplify your payments and reduce your stress.\nBut it’s important to do your research and make sure you’re working with a reputable lender. Some debt consolidation companies charge high fees or offer loans with hidden costs. Make sure you understand all of the terms and conditions before signing any agreements.\nConclusion\nDebt can be overwhelming and stressful, but debt consolidation can help you say goodbye to debt forever. By calculating your loan consolidation and working with a reputable lender, you can simplify your payments and save money in the long run.\nIf you’re struggling with debt, take the first step towards financial freedom by exploring debt consolidation today.\nWhat is Debt Consolidation Loan? Debt consolidation is the process through which a borrower refinances and combines several loans into a single one to receive the benefit of a lower interest rate or a reduced periodic payment, or maybe both. In addition, it leads to a reduction in his liability and eases the management of the loans.\nWe need to understand that the consolidation process does not reduce the loan obligation. However, it reduces the interest on a loan or shortens the period, leading to a quicker repayment.\nGenerally, debt consolidation is most popular for credit card loans and student loans. However, it may also apply to government debt or corporate debt. At times, such loans require collateral, and one of the most popular collateral is home equity.\nYou are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Debt Consolidation (wallstreetmojo.com)\nProcess of Debt Consolidation Loan Loan consolidation can be self-created such as balance transfer options of credit cards, or can be achieved by seeking the help of a financial institutionFinancial InstitutionFinancial institutions refer to those organizations which provide business services and products related to financial or monetary transactions to their clients. Some of these are banks, NBFCs, investment companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and trust corporations. read more.As shown in the below flow diagram, the intermediary financially approaches all the lenders on behalf of the borrower and informs them of the consolidation and new terms and conditions once it is satisfied with the ability of the borrower to pay off the loan. As a result, secured loans have a better chance of getting consolidated, while unsecured loansUnsecured LoansAn unsecured loan is a loan extended without the need for any collateral. It is supported by a borrower’s strong creditworthiness and economic stabilityread more are more difficult.After consolidation, the borrower makes payments to the consolidation intermediary, paying the lenders. A few institutions that provide debt consolidation facilities are the following:\nLendingtreeLightstreamDiscover Debt ConsolidationMarcus by Goldman SachsWells Fargo Examples to Calculate Debt Consolidation Loan There can be two situations that can lead to a reduced liability through debt consolidation: –\nInterest rates and periodic payments reduce, while the loan term remains constant.The periodic payment remains constant while the loan term and interest rate are reduced. Let us look into a few examples to understand both of the above situations: –\nExample #1 Suppose we have four loans of $250,000.00 each with an average interest rate of 20% p.a. We find out that we can consolidate it into one loan at 15% p.a. Therefore, if we are given the information 1-4 as shown below, we calculate the 5th, i.e., PMT: –\nA periodic payment is calculated by solving the following equation: –\nPV = PMT* (1-(1+r/frequency)-n*frequency) / (r/frequency)\nWe calculate the PMT under both scenarios below, followed by their respective amortization schedulesAmortization SchedulesThe amortization schedule for a mortgage is an index that provides the details of a mortgage loan repayment. It shows both the amount repaid as the principal and the sum paid as interest to date by the borrower.read more, and then draw a comparison between the two to understand the impact of debt consolidation.\nBefore Consolidation: –\n= PVBefore Consolidation = PMT (1+(1+20%/12)^(-212))/(20%/12)= 1,000,000 = PMT * (1+(1+20%/12)^(-2*12))/(20%/12)PMT = 1,000,000/196480PMT = $50,895.80 Amortization Schedule Before Consolidation: –\nAmortization Schedule After Consolidation\nPVAfter Consolidation = PMT (1+(1+15%/12)^(-212))/(15%/12)1,000,000 = PMT * (1+(1+15%/12)^(-2*12))/(15%/12)PMT = 1,000,000/20.6242PMT = $48,486.65 Points for understanding the above calculations: –\nOpening balance = previous year’s closing balance.Closing balance = Opening balance + Loan- Principal repaymentPMTPMTPMT function is an advanced financial function to calculate the monthly payment against the simple loan amount. You have to provide basic information, including loan amount, interest rate, and duration of payment, and the function will calculate the payment as a result.read more is calculated as per the above formulaInterest = 0.20/12 x opening balance in before consolidation scenario and 0.15/12 x opening balance in after consolidation scenarioPrincipal repayment = PMT – Interest Comparing the two scenarios, we observe: –\nThis example is of the first type mentioned above, wherein the interest rate and periodic payments both get reduced due to a fall in the interest rate from 20% to 15%.Total interest paid before consolidation over the two years was $221,499.26, while that after the consolidation is $163,679.55; therefore, this leads to a saving of $57,819.71.The monthly payment before consolidation was $50895.80, while that after the consolidation was $48486.65, which leads to a saving of $2,409.15 per month.To pay off a loan of $1,000,000, before consolidation, we pay a total amount of $50,895.80 x 24 = $1,221,499.26 while after consolidation we pay off the same loan by paying only $48,486.65 x 24 = $1,163,679.55, which is a saving of $57,819.71, same as the difference between the total interest mentioned in the first bullet point. Example #2 Now let us look at an example where the periodic payment remains constant while the interest rate and the term of the loan reduce: –\nPoint to be noted:\nBefore, the consolidation scenario was the same as in the previous example, and the PMT calculation was also the same. However, we keep the PMT the same as before consolidation after the consolidation scenario, but the interest rate falls. Therefore, the time taken for the loan to repay has been shortened to 23 months instead of the full two years, and the last payment will be less than $50,895.80 so that it is sufficient to pay off the loan.\nTherefore, all the calculations for the before consolidation scenario remain the same while those for after consolidation are as follows: –\nPVAfter Consolidation = PMT (1+(1+15%/12) ^(-n12))/ (15%/12)1,000,000 = 50895.80* (1+(1+15%/12) ^(-n*12))/ (15%/12)n = 1.89 years. Amortization Schedule After Consolidation: –\nWe can even view the same graphically in the below chart of interest and principal payment Principal PaymentThe principle amount is a significant portion of the total loan amount. Aside from monthly installments, when a borrower pays a part of the principal amount, the loan’s original amount is directly reduced.read more.\nThis example is of the second type mentioned above.Total interest paid before consolidation over the two years was $221,499.26, while that after the consolidation is $154,751.62; therefore, this leads to a saving of $66,747.64.The time is taken to pay off before consolidation was 24 months, while that after the consolidation is 22 months when the PMT = $50,895.80 and the 23rd month of liquidating payment of $35,043.96.

It leads to similar loans being available at a lower interest rate. In such an interest rate environment, refinancing or consolidating debt is rational, reducing borrowers’ interest obligations.Tax deductibility: This is country-specific; however, under certain circumstances, the debt backed by collateral is allowed tax deductions by the IRS in the US.Ease of management: Consolidation leads to only a single payment instead of several payments, reducing omission errors.Lower collection cost: From the lender’s point of view, the collection costs reduce as instead of incurring the same for several loans, they have incurred the same for only one loan.

Therefore, it may mitigate periodic payments to a more affordable level, but the initial loan amount ultimately remains the same.Difficult for unsecured loans: Consolidation is easier for loans that do not offer collateral. Therefore, not all borrowers can benefit from the lower interest rate environment.Strict terms and conditions: Loans backed by a home as collateral may become risky if the borrower cannot make periodic payments. That could lead to the lender claiming the collateral itself.Creditworthiness: A very high creditworthiness is required for a financial institution to refinanceRefinanceRefinancing is defined as taking a new debt obligation in exchange for an ongoing debt obligation.

Without such creditworthinessCreditworthinessCreditworthiness is a measure of judging the loan repayment history of borrowers to ascertain their worth as a debtor who should be extended a future credit or not. For instance, a defaulter’s creditworthiness is not very promising, so the lenders may avoid such a debtor out of the fear of losing their money. Creditworthiness applies to people, sovereign states, securities, and other entities whereby the creditors will analyze your creditworthiness before getting a new loan.read more, debt consolidation may not be possible. Conclusion Debt consolidation is the process of combining multiple debts to take advantage of lower interest rates and convert multiple payment streams into a single one leading to an easier repayment structure. However, the borrower must assess the appropriateness before trying to consolidate his debt because defaulting on even a single payment can cost him dearly, unlike in the case of unconsolidated loans because the risk becomes non-diversified.\nRecommended Articles This article is a guide to Debt Consolidation and its meaning.
