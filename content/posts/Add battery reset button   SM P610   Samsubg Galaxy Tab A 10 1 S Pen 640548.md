Title: Revive Your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen Battery Life in Seconds with this Secret Trick!

Are you tired of constantly running out of battery on your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen? Have you tried numerous battery-saving tips, but nothing seems to work? Don't worry! We have found a secret trick that can revive your tablet's battery life in seconds.

Firstly, make sure you have enabled the "Power Saving Mode" on your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen. You can do this by going to "Settings" and selecting "Device care." Under this option, select "Battery" and enable "Power Saving Mode." This will automatically optimize your tablet's performance, reduce the screen brightness, and limit the number of background applications running.

The next step is to access the "Developer Options" on your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen. To do this, go to "Settings" and select "About phone" or "About tablet." Scroll down to "Build number," and tap on it seven times. You will then receive a notification that "Developer options" have been enabled.

Once you have access to the "Developer Options," scroll down to "Background check." This option allows you to select which applications can run in the background, which significantly improves your tablet's battery life. Make sure to disable applications that you don't use frequently, or those that are not essential for your tablet's functioning.

When you have disabled the applications that you don't need, you can further improve your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen's battery life by disabling the "Animations" and "Window animations." These options make your tablet's transitions and animations appear smoother, but they consume a lot of battery power. To disable these animations, go to "Developer Options," scroll down to the "Drawing" section, and disable both "Animations" and "Window animations."

Once you have followed these steps, your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen should have a significantly improved battery life. By optimizing your tablet's performance and reducing the number of applications running in the background, you can enjoy using your tablet for longer periods without worrying about running out of battery.

In conclusion, not only can these tips save your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 S Pen's battery life, but they can also optimize its performance. Furthermore, following these simple steps takes seconds and doesn't require any technical expertise. It's a win-win situation, as you can improve your tablet's battery life without compromising its functionality.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Samsung Galaxy P610 Tab S6 Lite and when I reboot it (via Android option or reset keys - Power + Volume Down) it does not power back up.
It can take hours to days where whatever is the issue discharges or clears and the device will power back up. The screen is black when it is malfunctioning and with the USB power connected or not the device will not respond. A reset via Power + Volume Down will not bring the device back up until a discharge or clear (or whatever is causing this issue) occurs internally. Eventually if I connect USB power and when pressing the Power button I see the battery status on the screen (as it should do when the device is powered down). At this point I know the device will power back up.
This is a known problem on the Internet for this device. (On guy on the Internet was going to turn his device into an expensive cutting board and then his device suddenly starting powering up - similar to what I have described.) Some have blamed it on a firmware crash. I am current on firmware.
I have had both Samsung and Asurion look at the device and they have determined nothing is wrong.
The best solution I have come up with is to install a reset button for the battery ground connection that would allow me to "disconnect" the battery in order to return the device to functionality.
Does anyone know of someone who would be willing to consider adding a reset button like this that would allow me to disconnect the battery when needed?

 Hi David,
The problem with your proposed solution is that the battery is connected to the motherboard with a flex ribbon cable that carries several signal and power wires. Those flex cables are exceptionally difficult to work with and it would be almost impossible to modify to insert a switch into the power wire.
If it were me personally I'd strongly consider just opening it up (the back just pries off, no adhesive) and unplugging the battery's flex cable when necessary, but I understand you want a little more push button style approach.
Next best thing I can come up with would be to just cut a hole in the back over the battery connector so you can access it without removing the cover. You could block off the hole with tape when you're not using it, or jerry-rig some kind of door you can open when needed. I snagged a photo off the French sosav.com site that shows a better picture of the battery connector than the one here on the iFixit site.
