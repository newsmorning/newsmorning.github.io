Title: "Solving the Mystery Behind the Flashing LG Logo and Faint Image on Your TV"

Introduction:

Are you experiencing a flashing LG logo and a faint image on your LG 42LA6208 TV screen? If so, this can be a frustrating and perplexing issue to deal with. However, there is a solution to this problem that doesn't require you to purchase a new TV. In this article, we'll explore the root cause of this issue and provide you with some practical solutions to solve it.

Body:

There are several possible reasons why your LG 42LA6208 TV could be displaying a flashing logo and faint image. The most common culprits include:

1. Faulty T-Con Board: The T-Con board is responsible for controlling the content on your TV screen. If this component is malfunctioning, you're likely to experience a flashing LG logo and faint image. To fix this issue, you'll need to replace the T-Con board.

2. Loose or Damaged Cables: Another common cause of the flashing logo and faint image could be due to loose or damaged cables. Check all the cables connecting your TV to other devices like set-top boxes and gaming consoles. If you find any loose or damaged cables, replace them.

3. Poor Signal Strength: Weak or poor signal strength could also cause your TV to display a flashing LG logo and faint image. Check your antenna or cable connection to ensure it's properly installed and providing a strong signal.

4. Display Settings: Finally, the issue could be due to incorrect display settings. Check your TV's settings and ensure they're properly configured. You may need to adjust the brightness, contrast, or color settings to get rid of the flashing logo and faint image.

Here are some practical steps you can take to solve this issue:

Step 1: Check and replace any faulty cables. Make sure all the cables connecting your TV and other devices are firmly connected and not damaged.

Step 2: Check the signal strength of your antenna or cable connection. If the signal is weak or poor, this could explain the issue.

Step 3: Adjust your TV's display settings to ensure they're correctly configured. You may need to adjust the brightness, contrast, or color settings.

Step 4: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you may need to replace the T-Con board. This component controls the content displayed on your TV screen and is a common cause of the flashing logo and faint image.

Conclusion:

If you're experiencing a flashing LG logo and faint image on your TV screen, don't panic. There are several possible causes for this issue, and with some troubleshooting and minor repairs, you can restore your TV to its former glory.

 Hi all,
when i switch on the TV the LG logo flashes for just a fraction of a second, then the TV screen goes dark.  when i switch the settings on you can very very faintly see the outlines and text in the dark, but extremely faint you have to be next to the screen to see it distinctively.  when i switch it off the red light flashes bout 4 times.
i thought it was the main board, replaced it with one from a tv that had a cracked lcd, but the problem remained the same exactly. so obviously not that :(, just my stroke of luck as always :)
so any of you might have a clue on how to fix it, is it the power supply, tcon?
hope you can help me, if i can do it my self it might be worth the while, turning in a 5 year old TV to a repair sop might be better just buying a new one.
cheers and thank you in advance!!!

 @cromag …sounds like a bad led. you have image on the screen still so i dont think its the tcon. you can test the power supply voltage going to the leds and see if it is feeding the voltage it needs. if its present, id look at troubleshooting/replacing the leds. if not, troubleshoot the power supply.

 Hi @cromag ,
Here’s an image taken from p.93 of the service manual for the TV showing the No Video / No audio troubleshooting flowchart which may be a good place to start and also the manual has full schematics which helps.
Unfortunately you have to sign up to download the manual, but if you persevere you can go through it by using the page numbers at the bottom of the document. It’s tedious but you’ll soon get the hang of it
Start at p.93 and go on from there.
