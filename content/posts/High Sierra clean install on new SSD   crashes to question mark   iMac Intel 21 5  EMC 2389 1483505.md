Have you ever experienced a catastrophic crash after performing a clean install of High Sierra on a new SSD for your iMac Intel 21.5 EMC 2389? If you have, you're not alone! It turns out that this problem is not uncommon, and many people have been struggling with it for years. In this article, we'll explore what causes this issue and offer some tips on how to avoid it.

First, let's discuss what exactly is happening. Essentially, the clean install of High Sierra causes the iMac to crash repeatedly, leaving users unable to boot up their computer. This is obviously a frustrating and disruptive problem, particularly if you rely on your computer for work or personal use.

So why does this happen? There are a few potential causes, but one of the most likely culprits is a compatibility issue between High Sierra and the iMac Intel 21.5 EMC 2389. Although this particular iMac model was originally released in 2011, it should be able to run High Sierra without any problems. However, some users have reported that the clean install process somehow creates issues with the computer's firmware or settings, leading to the crash.

Another possible cause is a problem with the SSD itself. If the new SSD is not compatible with the iMac or is faulty in some way, it could cause the clean install to fail and ultimately lead to a crash.

So how can you avoid this issue? There are a few different steps you can take to minimize the risk of a catastrophic crash:

1. Check compatibility: Before purchasing any components for your iMac, be sure to double-check that they are compatible with your specific model. This can help you avoid any potential issues related to firmware or hardware compatibility.

2. Install High Sierra differently: Rather than performing a clean install, you could try upgrading your existing operating system to High Sierra instead. This may be less prone to causing compatibility issues, although it won't necessarily solve all problems.

3. Troubleshoot the SSD: If you suspect that the new SSD is causing the problem, you may need to troubleshoot it to determine the issue. This could involve running diagnostic tests or seeking assistance from the manufacturer.

In conclusion, a catastrophic crash after a clean install of High Sierra on a new SSD is an unfortunate and all-too-common problem for iMac Intel 21.5 EMC 2389 users. While there is no foolproof way to avoid this issue entirely, you can take steps to minimize the risk and troubleshoot any potential issues that arise. By doing so, you can hopefully avoid data loss and quickly get your computer back up and running.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi hoping someone can help.  I have upgraded my 2010 iMAC 21’.  Installed a new SSD and after trying to do internet recovery can get to the Disk Utility.
Have erased the disks and reset to MAC OS Extended (Journaled) - GUID Partition Map
When I try to reinstall macOS High Sierra, I can see the disk, it runs until about 2 minutes to go, and then reboots to the grey screen and the question mark.
Anybody got any advice please?
Thanks in advance.

 Let’s give this a try: Restart your system and press the Option (⌥) key to get to the Startup Disk Manager. Then using the keypad arrow keys select the drive you installed the OS onto. Did that work?
If it did go into your preferences and set the startup disk for the boot drive. Shutdown, Unplug the power cord for the night, in the morning plug your cord back in and restart did the setting hold? If not your PRAM battery needs replacing.
