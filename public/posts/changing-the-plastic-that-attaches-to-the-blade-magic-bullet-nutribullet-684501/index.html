Are you tired of the same old boring smoothie routine? Are you looking for a way to take your smoothie game to the next level? Well, look no further! The secret to a game-changing smoothie is really quite simple - ditch the old plastic and try this.\nWe all know that using a Nutribullet is a great way to blend fruits and vegetables into a delicious, healthy smoothie. But did you know that what you blend your smoothie in matters just as much as what goes into it?\nThe problem with traditional plastic blending cups is that they can be difficult to clean, and the plastic can sometimes leach chemicals into your food. Plus, if you’re like me, you’ve probably had to replace your plastic cups a few times because they crack or break after extended use.\nThat’s where the Nutribullet Stainless Steel Cup comes in. This sleek, durable cup is made from high-quality, food-grade stainless steel and is designed to fit perfectly on your Nutribullet base. Not only is it stronger and more durable than plastic, but it also keeps your smoothie colder for longer, thanks to its insulating properties.\nBut the real game-changer when it comes to the Nutribullet Stainless Steel Cup is the way it transforms the taste and texture of your smoothies. Because stainless steel is a superior conductor of heat, it helps to break down the cell walls of fruits and vegetables more efficiently, resulting in a smoother, creamier, and more delicious smoothie.\nIn fact, many users have reported that their smoothies are less gritty, and the flavors of the ingredients are more pronounced when blended in the Nutribullet Stainless Steel Cup. And because it’s so easy to clean, you can use it over and over again without worrying about any lingering flavors or smells from previous blends.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Ditch the old plastic and try the Nutribullet Stainless Steel Cup today. You won’t believe how one small change can transform your smoothie game and take your health and wellness to the next level.\nChosen Solution When you take out the cup that contains the blades you’ll see a plastic circle with a nut in the center to hold it to the motor. That plastic broke \u0026 I have bought a replacement but can’t get the old nut off the motor. Suggestions?!?!\n@texjohn , John , Below are video links to show how to remove/replace the plastic drive gear. Caution the gear is threaded opposite to normal threads clock wise to remove/counter clockwise to tighten. Good luck. I hope this helped you out, if so let me know by pressing the helpful button. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq6KduZg… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uF2_bAL… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX2FpiQu…\nI’m also stripping the screw top at the base trying to get it off. A hole in the side of the shaft would give much better leverage in a system that self tightens than a naff old screw and a hole in the plastic base that doesn’t let a screwdriver through, OK Found a solution. Remove the base plate (4 screws), wiggle the plastic fan off the shaft of the screw head (now stripped because it is very difficult to get effective torque with that much surface area to screwdriver surface area plus really soft metal) and grip the ribbed shaft with pliers while turning the plastic base gear up top. Really Nutribullet a loosening direction arrow (because it is opposite what is usual and difficult to deduce from mirror image videos) and a hole in the shaft to ease turning would make changing this so much easier and so much less landfill.\nThis video has the juice.
