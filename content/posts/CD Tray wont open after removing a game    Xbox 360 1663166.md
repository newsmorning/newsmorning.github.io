Title: Xbox 360 Nightmare: Game Stuck in CD Tray, Won't Open at All!

Introduction:
Xbox 360 is one of the most popular gaming consoles ever made to date. It was released in 2005 and since then, gaming enthusiasts around the world rallied to get their hands on it. However, as popular as the Xbox 360 is, it's not flawless. One of the common problems that gamers face is a game stuck in the CD tray, which won't open at all. This article will help you understand the issue and provide you the solution.

The Problem:
The basic principle of an Xbox 360 console is simple - insert the game, and it starts to play. However, not every time that it happens as planned. One of the biggest nightmares of every gamer is when the game is stuck in the console's CD tray, and it won't open. There are several reasons why this happens:

1. Defective tray/gear mechanism: The tray/gear mechanism is the main component that is responsible for opening and closing the CD tray. Over a period of time, it may weaken, and the result of this is that the tray will not open, and the game stuck inside.

2. Dirty lens: Another reason for an Xbox 360 game getting stuck inside the console is if there is dirt or other debris present on the lens. In such cases, the console's laser is unable to read the disk, causing it to get stuck in the CD tray.

3. Broken eject button: If the eject button on the Xbox 360 console is damaged, it will not release the CD tray, causing the game to get stuck inside.

The Solution:
Several ways can help fix an Xbox 360 console that won't open the CD tray with the game stuck inside. Here are some ways you can resolve the issue.

1. Ejecting manually: First, switch off the console, then unplug it from the main power source, then look for a small hole that is located just beside the CD tray's eject button. Take a long, thin object like a paper clip, and push it through the hole. Eventually, this will release the CD tray, and you can take out the game CD.

2. Cleaning the lens: It's important to clean the lens of the Xbox 360 to prevent dust buildup, which could lead to problems. You can purchase a lens cleaner, which will remove any dirt or debris present on the lens.

3. Replacing the gear/tray mechanism: If the gear mechanism or tray is damaged, it needs to be replaced. This can be done by contacting the Xbox 360 support center or a technician who can fix the issue.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Xbox 360's CD tray getting stuck is a frustrating experience for every gamer. However, there are several ways you can fix it to have it working again. If the problem persists, it's advisable to seek professional help or contact Xbox 360 support. With this knowledge in mind, you can continue playing your favorite games worry-free.

## Chosen Solution
 How to fix a XBOX 360? It has no games on it, but every time i hit the button, the cd tray wont open. Why?

 Does the try "tries" to open but has difficulty doing so?
If so the drive loading mechanism is out of grease, preventing smooth unlocking and descending.
Also the motor belt may have degraded, so less torque is transmitted.
