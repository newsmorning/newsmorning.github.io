Title: Shocking Revelation: LG Washer Drain Hose Secretly Requires this Floor Drain - You Won't Believe What Happens if You Don't Use It!

Introduction:
Have you ever experienced a shocking disaster while washing your clothes? A disaster that can ruin your day and damage your property? If so, then this article is for you. Recently, we discovered a secret requirement for LG washer models that has gone unnoticed by most users - the secret drain hose. In this article, we will reveal what this drain hose is, why it is important, and what happens if you don't use it.

What is LG Washer Drain Hose and Why it is Important?
The LG washer drain hose is a long and flexible hose that connects to the back of the washer machine and drains the water out of the machine into a floor drain. This drain hose is designed to provide a safe and efficient way to dispose of the dirty water. The floor drain, on the other hand, is a grated trench under the washer designed to catch the water and channel it out of the house.

The reason why the drain hose is important is that any other method of draining water can lead to flooding and damage to the house. Using a bucket or container to catch the water is not a reliable solution, especially if you have a large washing machine. Water can spill, overflow, and damage the surrounding areas. That's why the drain hose was designed to make washing clothes convenient and worry-free.

What Happens If You Don't Use the LG Washer Drain Hose?
If you don't use the LG washer drain hose, the water from the washing machine will have nowhere to go. It will continue to accumulate in the washing machine until it spills over and floods the surrounding area. The water can damage the floors, carpets, furniture, and electrical appliances. It can also pose a health risk by promoting the growth of mold and bacteria.

The reason why this disaster can happen is that the LG washer machine is not designed to hold the water for an extended period. If the drain hose is not connected, the water will overflow and damage the machine, which can be expensive to repair or replace. Therefore, it is crucial to use the floor drain and LG washer drain hose together to avoid any accidents.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the LG washer drain hose is an essential component of the washing machine that should not be overlooked. The secret requirement of the floor drain and drain hose is there for a reason - to keep your home safe and prevent costly disasters. If you're not using it, you're putting your property and health at risk. To avoid any accidents, make sure you connect the LG washer drain hose to the floor drain before using the machine. Trust us; you won't regret it.

## Chosen Solution
 I have done everything suggested after I got an OE error message on my LG washer. Strange thing is that when the drain hose fell to the floor, after I took it out of the inlet in the laundry tub whilst machine on, water starting flowing out at a steady rate. I played around with the direction of the hose but as end of the hose went higher then 40cm from the floor water would stop pumping through. I turned off the power at the wall and put the washing machine on a tub cycle.
I have been able to wash with no errors happening if I direct drain hose to drainage hole in Laundry floor. Not ideal to leave it like this as the washing machine needs to be placed in middle of laundry room.
I opened up drain filter -  nice and cleanChecked pump impeller whilst drain filter taken out. Moved freely. I also  chose a spin cycle and I can see impeller spinning beautifully.I Blew air into hose. I could feel air coming out other end near filter. I also ran water down the hose. Flowed out with no problem the other end.
What to do now? Has the pump lost pressure and that is why it cannot work with hose directed upwards towards laundry tub (90cm above the floor)? I can hear motor working and see impeller working.

 Ok so if the washer will gravity drain and the pump is spinning dry, why won't it drain? The pump is failing under load. The impeller has loosened from the shaft. Try replacing the power head of the pump.
