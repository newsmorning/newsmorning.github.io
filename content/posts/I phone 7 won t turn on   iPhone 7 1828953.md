Have you been trying to turn on your iPhone 7 only to see it remain unresponsive? This can be a frustrating experience, and it's easy to jump to conclusions and think that your device is dead. However, there could be several reasons behind your iPhone's failure to turn on.

Here are the top reasons why your iPhone 7 won't turn on, along with some possible solutions to fix the issue.

## Battery issues

If your iPhone 7 won't turn on, the first thing you should check is the battery. Batteries are consumable components and can only last for a certain period. If the battery has reached its end of life, your phone won't turn on. Alternatively, if you've neglected to charge your phone, it may not have enough battery life to turn on.

To fix battery-related issues, try the following:

- Charge your iPhone 7 using a different charger or USB cable.
- Replace your iPhone 7's battery. This is best accomplished at an Apple store or an authorized repair center.

## Software-related issues

Another reason why your iPhone 7 may not be turning on is due to software-related issues. It could be that the operating system has crashed, or there's a software bug that's causing the device to malfunction.

To fix software-related issues, try the following:

- Force restart your iPhone 7. To do this, press and hold the power and volume down buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo appears.
- Connect your iPhone 7 to iTunes on your computer and try to restore the device using a backup.
- Update your iPhone 7 to the latest version of iOS.

## Water damage

If your iPhone 7 has come into contact with water or other liquids, that could be causing it not to turn on. When liquid enters an electronic device, it can cause damage to the internal components and short out the device.

To fix water damage, try the following:

- Turn off your iPhone 7 immediately and do not turn it back on.
- Remove the SIM tray, and if water is present, dry it off with a clean towel.
- Bring your iPhone 7 to an authorized repair center, where they can assess the extent of the damage and offer possible repair options.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why your iPhone 7 may not be turning on, from battery issues to software bugs, and even water damage. Before jumping to conclusions that your device is dead, take a few steps to assess and try to fix the problem using the solutions mentioned above. If the issue persists, get in touch with an authorized repair center or the Apple store for further assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 I received an iPhone 7 from my girlfriend, that no longer turns on. I have tried charging it with 2 different charger cables and nothing happens. It doesn't show a charging screen or turn on. Our laptop doesn't seem to detect it either, I didn't try using iTunes tho. Is there a way to figure if it's the battery or the charging port on the phone?
*Edit: unfortunately I have just been informed that I had been dropped on garage floor, maybe it's something other than the battery. Does anybody have any suggestions on how I can go about figuring out what's wrong with it?

 It most likely a battery i’ve bought phones off eBay that don’t turn on because of dead batteries. But first try the  basics  first like cleaning the lighting port. But if that desnt’t work then it’s most likely the battery. Charging port failures on a not very old IPhone aren’t common.  But if it’s software it could be in dfu mode if that’s the case force shut it down and see if it wil boot up normally
Hope this helps

 without multiple spare parts at your disposal I would take it to a shop, you could waste your money buying parts just to discover its a board level repair.

 That's what I'd do too. My shop would charge 20.00 for the troubleshooting. If any parts were needed we'd absorb that 20 and just charge whatever the repair cost is. Look for a shop that does that and also preferable no solution no charge.
