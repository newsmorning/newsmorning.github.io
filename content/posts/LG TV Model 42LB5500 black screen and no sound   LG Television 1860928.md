Is Your LG Television Giving You the Black Screen of Death? See How to Fix the 42LB5500 Model and Restore Your Sound!

As technology continues to evolve, the idea of sitting down to watch your favorite shows and movies is also changing. Long gone are the days of bulky televisions that required you to press physical buttons to change the channels or adjust the volume. Nowadays, televisions come in sleek designs with flat screens, providing excellent picture quality and immersive sound. However, even with all the improvements we have come to expect, technology still goes wrong sometimes, leaving you with the notorious "black screen of death."

If you're one of the many LG TV owners experiencing this problem, don't worry - you're not alone. LG is known for producing some of the best TVs out there. Even the 42LB5500 model, which was first released in 2014, is still widely used by many households today. However, one of the most common issues that users face with this model is a black screen or no sound.

So what steps can you take to fix this problem? Here's a guide to get you started.

1. Troubleshoot the Power Supply

The first thing to check is to make sure your television is getting power. If your LG TV is not turning on or repeatedly goes off and on, or you have a black screen with no sound, it's possible that your power supply unit is faulty. You can swap the power cord, unplug the device and remove the power cord from the outlet, then wait for a few minutes before plugging it back in. Try to power the TV on to see if it works.

2. Check the HDMI Cables

The use of HDMI cables has become mainstream because of their effectiveness in providing high-quality sound and picture for your LG TV. If your LG TV has a black screen or no sound, the problem may be with your HDMI cables. Check to see if the cables are securely connected and plugged in tightly. You can also unplug them completely and try connecting them again.

3. Factory Reset

If the problem persists, resetting your LG TV to its factory settings could help. A lot of TV problems can be fixed by doing this. Keep in mind that performing a factory reset will delete all saved settings and data such as Wi-Fi passwords, apps, channels, and custom configurations.

To perform a factory reset, follow these steps:

a. Turn your LG TV on
b. Press the settings icon on your remote control
c. Select option
d. Scroll down and select General.
e. Select Reset
f. Confirm your action and allow the TV to complete the reset process.

4. Repair or Replace the Mainboard

If all of the above steps have been followed and the problem persists, it may be time to have your LG TV's mainboard repaired or replaced. Bear in mind that this process can be costly, and you should only consider replacing the mainboard if you're sure that it's the cause of the problem. Contacting LG customer support is always an excellent place to start since they can provide you with more specific solutions.

In conclusion, your LG TV is an essential aspect of your home entertainment system, and having a black screen or no sound can be frustrating. However, as seen above, the solutions are simple and straightforward to follow. By troubleshooting the power supply, checking your HDMI cables, resetting your device, or repairing/replacing your mainboard, your LG TV can be restored to its former glory.

## Chosen Solution
 Our LG TV model number 42LB5500 suddenly lost both sound and picture (black screen). Don’t know if this is connected, but for a few weeks prior to the failure, the top left corner of the picture kept going slightly darker and then returning to normal, every few seconds.
I’ve replaced both the main board and the power board, but this hasn’t fixed it.
Anybody have any ideas please?

 Hi @philtoni ,
Don’t know the answer but maybe the service manual may help.
There appears to be 3 different chassis versions for the various model variants so try the one applicable to your exact model.
Usually the service manual has troubleshooting flowcharts for various problems like No Power or no video/audio etc.
Here’s an image of the No Power troubleshooting flowchart for a LA49B chassis just to give you an idea
