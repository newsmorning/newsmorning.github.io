 Hi, I have this problem since a month:
Suddenly, the display's light becomes flashing on the right and left sides, and after a while, the whole display dims gradually and doesn't respond to touches.
When that happens. I have to press the lock key in the back twice to take me to  the lock screen where I have to enter the pattern again.
'''NO SPECIFIC TIME FOR THIS PROBLEM TO OCCUR
'''
and some times it takes two days to see this problem again.
But sometimes it become so annoying and happened rapidly  so I can't do any thing with my phone.
Please help me, is it a screen problem ???

 i believe the lcd is going bad, i saw this same exact issue with a customers phone, i thought it was the proximity sensor so we took off her tempered glass, it worked then it came back right away.
my conclusion was she had either a faulty motherboard or faulty lcd
