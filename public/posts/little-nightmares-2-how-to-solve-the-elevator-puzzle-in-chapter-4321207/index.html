Are you stuck on Chapter 4 of Little Nightmares 2, trying to figure out how to solve the elevator puzzle? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. This puzzle has proven to be one of the toughest challenges in the game, leaving many players scratching their heads. But fear not, we’re here to help you conquer this mystery and move forward in the game.\nFirst, let’s review the problem. Chapter 4 opens with Six and Mono standing in front of an elevator. As soon as you enter, the elevator will go up for a few floors, and then abruptly stop. The only way to get it moving again is to solve a puzzle. The elevator has four floors, with a different room on each floor. You’ll have to navigate each room and push a button to unlock the next floor until you reach the top. Sounds easy enough, right? Except, every time you unlock a floor, the elevator will start to move again, and you’ll have to rush back to the elevator before it leaves without you.\nSo, how do you solve this puzzle?\nThe first thing you need to do is to explore the rooms on each floor. You’ll notice that each room has a different object that you can interact with. These objects are key to solving the puzzle. Let’s take a look at each floor and what you need to do.\nFloor 1:\nThis room is relatively straightforward. You will see a lever on the wall that you need to pull. Doing so will unlock the next floor. The trick is to run back to the elevator quickly because it starts to move as soon as you pull the lever.\nFloor 2:\nOn the second floor, you will find a wooden box. You need to push this box to the right side of the room and use it to climb onto the table. Once you’re on the table, jump onto the top of the elevator and ride it up to the next floor.\nFloor 3:\nThe third floor is where things get a bit more complicated. In this room, you will find two buttons on the wall. However, both buttons need to be pushed at the same time to unlock the next floor. To do this, you need to use a hanging lamp in the room. Position the lamp so that it swings and hits both buttons at the same time.\nFloor 4:\nThe final floor is the trickiest of them all. This room is pitch black, and you can’t see anything. You’ll have to rely on sound to figure out what you need to do. There’s a switch on the wall you need to flip. You’ll hear a sound when you do, and that will tell you that the door to the elevator has opened. Run back to the elevator and jump inside to complete the puzzle.\nAnd that’s it! By following these steps, you can solve the elevator puzzle in Chapter 4 of Little Nightmares 2. It’s not an easy puzzle, but don’t get discouraged. Take your time, explore each room thoroughly, and use your wits and skills to overcome the challenges. Good luck, and may you conquer the mysteries of the Maw!\nThere are numerous puzzles in Little Nightmares 2 but what players are finding it hard to solve the most is Elevator Puzzle in Chapter 4. This puzzle begins with Six and Mono entering an apartment and get themselves locked in an elevator.\nSince the first half of Chapter 4 is quite easy, players thought that the Elevator Puzzle will be solved in a few seconds but there are thousands of players who have been having trouble finding ways to solve it. If you too don’t know how to solve Elevator Puzzle (Chapter 4) in Little Nightmares 2 then don’t worry, we have got you covered.\nHow To Solve The Elevator Puzzle (Chapter 4) in Little Nightmares 2 Solving the Elevator Puzzle (Chapter 4) in Little Nightmares is quite easy if you know what actually you need to do. Once both Mono and Six get inside the elevator, you will have to use the lever to send the elevator up. Once the elevator reaches its destination, you will realize that there is no way to get out of the elevator or free Six.\nNow, use the laver to send the elevator down. In between, you will find a hold in the wall on the right-side. You will have to jump properly because the elevator is in motion. Once jumped, you will need to climb through the hole.\nNow, you will have to climb up to the same floor where the Elevator is stopped. Your primary aim to let Mono out from the Elevator and for that, you will have to find a key. Once reached the floor where Mono is locked inside of the Elevator, you will find a small office there.\nWhen you get inside the office, you will find a table and the key is kept inside the table’s drawer. After picking up the key, unlock the elevator and free Mono.\nOnce Mono is freed, you will have to go inside the elevator and send it back to the place where you started. Now, use the lever to send the elevator up but you will have to jump to the right about halfway but this time you will land on a ladge.\nClimb up to the floor where Mono is waiting for you. Now, get inside the elevator and pull the lever to send it back down. Make sure to jump quickly or else you will also go down with the elevator. Use the lever to pull the lift up. As soon as the Elevator is about to approach your floor, both Six and Mono will have to jump on top of the elevator.\nDoing this will grant you access to the attic above, from where you can progress to the next section of the level.\nThat’s everything you need to know about how to solve the Elevator Puzzle (Chapter 4) in Little Nightmares 2. While you are here, ensure reading about how to tune TV transmissions and how to blend in with the Wooden children in Little Nightmares 2.\n","wordCount":"1057","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Judy Garcia"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/little-nightmares-2-how-to-solve-the-elevator-puzzle-in-chapter-4321207/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Discover The Secret To Solving The Toughest Puzzle Yet in Little Nightmares 2 - Conquer Chapter 4's Elevator Mystery Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 22, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1057 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Judy Garcia</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-to-solve-the-elevator-puzzle-chapter-4-in-little-nightmares-2>How To Solve The Elevator Puzzle (Chapter 4) in Little Nightmares 2</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=discover-the-secret-to-solving-the-toughest-puzzle-yet-in-little-nightmares-2---conquer-chapter-4s-elevator-mystery-now>Discover The Secret To Solving The Toughest Puzzle Yet in Little Nightmares 2 - Conquer Chapter 4&rsquo;s Elevator Mystery Now!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discover-the-secret-to-solving-the-toughest-puzzle-yet-in-little-nightmares-2---conquer-chapter-4s-elevator-mystery-now>#</a></h1><p>Are you stuck on Chapter 4 of Little Nightmares 2, trying to figure out how to solve the elevator puzzle?
