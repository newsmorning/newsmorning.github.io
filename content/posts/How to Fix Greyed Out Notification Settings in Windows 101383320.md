Unlock The Secret To Customizing Your Notifications: Fix Greyed Out Settings In Windows 10 Now!

Are you one of the many Windows 10 users who have encountered the issue of greyed out notification settings? If so, don't worry, you're not alone. This problem has been a common complaint among Windows 10 users, and it can be quite frustrating when you're unable to customize your notification settings.

But fear not, as there are several solutions to this issue. In this article, we will discuss the possible reasons behind this problem and provide you with simple steps to fix it.

Possible Reasons for Greyed Out Notification Settings

The most common cause of greyed out notification settings in Windows 10 is due to conflicts between certain applications and Windows 10's notification system. Some apps may have settings that conflict with the default settings of Windows 10 notifications. This conflict may lead to the greyed out notification settings.

Another possible reason is an outdated or corrupted Windows 10 installation. Windows 10 updates frequently, and if your installation is outdated, it may result in issues such as greyed out notification settings.

How To Fix Greyed Out Notification Settings in Windows 10

Fix 1: Check If Focus Assist is Enabled

Focus Assist is a feature in Windows 10 that automatically suppresses notifications when you're busy. If this feature is enabled, notifications may be blocked, and your settings may be greyed out.

To check if Focus Assist is enabled and disable it, follow these simple steps:

1. Click on the Windows button and select "Settings."

2. Click on "System" and select "Focus Assist."

3. Under "Automatic rules," select "Off."

4. Close the settings window, and your notification settings should now be available for customization.

Fix 2: Check If a Third-Party App Is Blocking Notifications

As mentioned earlier, some third-party apps may conflict with Windows 10's notification system, resulting in greyed out notification settings. To check if this is the case, you can try disabling all third-party apps temporarily and test to see if the notification settings are now available.

To disable all third-party apps and test notification settings, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Windows button and type "MSConfig" in the search bar.

2. Click on the "System Configuration" app from the search results.

3. Select the "Services" tab, and check the "Hide all Microsoft services" checkbox.

4. Click the "Disable all" button located at the bottom right of the window.

5. Click the "Startup" tab and click the "Open Task Manager" button.

6. Disable all third-party startup apps by right-clicking them and selecting "Disable."

7. Close the Task Manager, and restart your computer.

After restarting, check if the notification settings are now working correctly. If they are, the issue is likely due to a third-party app conflict. You can try enabling third-party apps one by one to see which one is causing the conflict.

Fix 3: Check if You Have the Latest Windows 10 Update

An outdated or corrupted Windows 10 installation can also lead to greyed out notification settings. To ensure you have the latest Windows 10 update, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Windows button and select "Settings."

2. Click on "Update & Security."

3. Click on "Check for updates," and Windows will automatically check for any available updates.

4. If any updates are found, click the "Download and install" button.

5. After the update has installed, restart your computer, and check if the notification settings are now available.

Conclusion

In conclusion, greyed out notification settings can be frustrating for Windows 10 users, but there are several solutions available to fix this issue. It is important to try each solution carefully, as some solutions may impact other aspects of your system, such as third-party app conflicts.

By following the simple steps outlined in this article, you can unlock the secret to customizing your notifications in Windows 10 once and for all.

If you’re using a Microsoft computer, you might have come across a common problem when you try to change the notification settings of your Windows 10. You may have noticed that some notification settings have suddenly become greyed out.
 
## Note that your Windows version may not be activated
 
- The notification settings include toggles for controlling notifications from apps, accounts, and other services.
 - When these settings are greyed out, it means that you cannot turn off or on anything related to notifications.

Notifications are not the only settings as your Webcam settings may also be greyed out. If you are facing the notification settings problem, then this post could help you out as we have listed all possible solutions to fix this.
 
## Why can’t I click on my notifications on Windows 10?
 
When you receive a new notification on your Windows 10 computer, you can click on it to open it. However, sometimes, you may have trouble clicking on your notifications. 
 
So, why is my message notification greyed out? Here are some possible causes:
 
- Your organization has applied GPO settings – Some settings are managed by your organization. This will block some apps from sending notifications. If this is the case, then you won’t see any notifications from any app that isn’t whitelisted.
 - Not enough permissions – When a notification is greyed-out, it could mean that the app developer has restricted access to certain parts of your computer and has not given permission for the app to display notifications.
 - You have not activated your version of Windows – If you’re a Windows 10 user and your notifications appear to be greyed out, there’s a good chance it’s because you haven’t activated your license. You won’t be able to see any desktop notifications even if they’re enabled in the settings.
 - Virus/malware – If you have a virus or malware on your system, then it might be blocking you from clicking on the notifications. You need a reliable antivirus to scan for any viruses.
 - Fast startup has been enabled – If your computer has Fast Startup enabled, it might be the reason why you can’t access notification settings. This feature enables your computer to start up faster but it also makes some crucial system files unavailable when the computer starts up.
 - The app has been disabled – If the action center is greyed out too, it means that the app that sent the notification is not currently running or has been disabled. You will need to open the associated app and enable it.

 
Let’s now look at ways to solve this issue down below.
 
## How can I fix greyed-out notification settings in Windows 10?
 
As always, it is prudent to check off the basics before proceeding to any advanced troubleshooting. These include:
 
- Ensure you have enabled the Notifications option.
 - Check if the associated app’s notifications have been enabled. You may want to get notifications from apps and other senders but not all.
 - Ensure you are running an activated version of Windows. If you run into an issue where your activation key is not working, refer to our fix guide.

 
If you’re lucky enough, one of these might solve your issue. However, if the notifications are still greyed out, proceed to more solutions below.
