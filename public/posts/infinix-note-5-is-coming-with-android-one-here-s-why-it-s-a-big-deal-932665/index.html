Are you looking for a smartphone that has it all? One that boasts advanced technology, stunning design, and top-of-the-line features? Look no further than the Infinix Note 5, a revolutionary smartphone that leverages Android One technology to deliver an unparalleled user experience.\nReleased in 2018, the Infinix Note 5 quickly became a fan favorite among tech enthusiasts and smartphone lovers. It’s sleek, stylish design and cutting-edge features make it one of the most sought-after devices on the market. But, what sets this phone apart from the competition is the use of Android One technology.\nAndroid One is a pure software experience developed by Google, designed to bring the latest version of Android to affordable devices. It offers a clean, bloat-free user experience with no unnecessary pre-installed apps, and frequent security updates to ensure that the user’s device is always up-to-date and secure. Infinix Note 5 is one of the few devices in the market that embraces this innovation.\nWith Android One on the Infinix Note 5, you will enjoy a more streamlined experience, faster updates, and software support for up to two years. This means that your phone will stay up-to-date with the latest security patches and software releases for many years to come. Android One on the Infinix Note 5 also delivers a faster and smoother user experience, which is essential for those who rely on their smartphone for work or entertainment.\nInfinix Note 5 also boasts a 6.0 inch full HD+ display, a 16MP rear camera, a 12MP front camera, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage. The powerful MediaTek Helio P23 chipset, coupled with a high-capacity 4500mAh battery, offers smooth performance through the toughest of tasks, and lasts all day on a single charge.\nThe Infinix Note 5 also comes with X-pen, a tool that offers a unique way to take notes, create drawings and paintings. X-pen support offers greater accuracy and sensitivity, making it perfect for people who enjoy taking handwritten notes or enjoy sketching.\nOverall, the combination of the latest Android One technology, powerful hardware, and versatile features, make the Infinix Note 5 a game-changing device. It’s an excellent choice for anyone looking for a smartphone that offers exceptional performance, software support, and value for money. Whether you’re looking for a device for yourself or as a gift for someone special, the Infinix Note 5 is a surefire winner. So, what are you waiting for? Get ready to be amazed!\nAndroid versions are vast, and if not critically studied can confuse you if you hear of another. As we familiarize with the new Oreo and the Go, a watered down version of Android that is designed for for low tier devices, in comes Android One. Infinix Mobile’s next phablet – the Infinix Note 5 – is bringing on board this version termed to be the ‘pure, easy, and clean to use’.\nThis won’t be the first Infinix device running the Android version, having come on the Hot 2 in Nigeria back in 2015, and this year a number of high ends phones from Nokia have been part of the Android One project.\nThe Note 5 is coming in succession after the Note 4 and Note 4 Pro which were released last year. These attracted huge attention based on the specs and the X-Pen that defined the true likeliness of a Note.\nInfinix Note 5 Rumoured Specs The latest series of Infinix phones has brought to mass the 18:9 aspect ratio, Android Oreo, Face Unlock technology, and less bezels. We do not expect the Note 5 to disappoint, given that it should be a wide screen in the hand – arguably 6 to 6.2 inches, with a screen resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels.\nWe can also anticipate a 4GB RAM and 32GB internal storage, while the Note 5 Pro would pack 64GB and a massive 5000mAh Non-removable battery; a dual rear camera, and front cam with LED flash for selfies and video calls.\nOther expected features of Infinix Note 5 and Infinix Note 5 Pro smartphones include the X-Pen stylus pen, a waterproof cover, and USB Type-C.\nWhat we do not know about is the processor, on whether it is MediaTek or Snapdragon.\nWhat is Android One? Android One is an Android project initially designed for first-time smartphone users in developing markets. First introduced at Google’s I/O conference in 2014, Android One phones are basically stock Android phones made by OEM partner manufacturers.\nAny phone lined within this project is guaranteed to have a solid and stable version of Android that’s not loaded with other apps, services and bloatware – exactly what the Infinix Note 5 will present.\nWhy an Android One phone? Android is open source, allowing manufacturers to fit in content into the device it runs on. An Android One smartphone runs on stock Android consumes less RAM, leaving more RAM available for other tasks.\nA fast RAM will only mean that the performance will be as excellent, and only something you can not miss out on!\nInfinix Note 5 Price and Availability Infinix has announced a June 24th launch date, to take place in Dubai, and possible local launch coming in afterwards. Pricing has not yet been released but expect the price to fall within the range of UGX 700,000 for the pro version.\nRelated ","wordCount":"898","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bertram Lancaster"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-note-5-is-coming-with-android-one-here-s-why-it-s-a-big-deal-932665/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary Android One Technology on Infinix Note 5 - Get Ready to be Amazed!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 19, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;898 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bertram Lancaster</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#infinix-note-5-rumoured-specs>Infinix Note 5 Rumoured Specs</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-android-one>What is Android One?</a></li><li><a href=#why-an-android-one-phone>Why an Android One phone?</a></li><li><a href=#infinix-note-5-price-and-availability>Infinix Note 5 Price and Availability</a><ul><li><a href=#related>Related</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=revolutionary-android-one-technology-on-infinix-note-5---get-ready-to-be-amazed>Revolutionary Android One Technology on Infinix Note 5 - Get Ready to be Amazed!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#revolutionary-android-one-technology-on-infinix-note-5---get-ready-to-be-amazed>#</a></h1><p>Are you looking for a smartphone that has it all?
