Introduction
---
Lost Ark is one of those games that have made quite a name for itself in the gaming industry. It is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that was once highly anticipated before its initial release. However, the game has been out since 2018, and players are wondering whether it is failing to meet its expectations. What's more, the current statistical reports indicate that the Lost Ark Steam player count has hit rock bottom, which begs the question, is the game dying?

Why Lost Ark was highly anticipated
---
Lost Ark is known to have an excellent story narrative, stunning graphics, elaborate dungeons, four diverse classes, a variety of PVE and PVP options, and a lot more. Those who played it emphasized that it was familiar, reminiscent of World of Warcraft, but with its unique charm. It seemed to offer a real chance for the die-hard players to indulge in exploring an exciting world filled with endless adventures.

The current situation
---
According to reports, the Lost Ark Steam player count has significantly declined from the numbers it had in 2019. In June 2019, when the game was initially released, it had an impressive 313,000 active concurrent players. Unfortunately, as of October 2021, it barely exceeds 2,800 active concurrent players. The statistics suggest that Lost Ark has lost 99% of its player base. 

Why is this happening?
---
One factor could be the fact that Lost Ark was launched primarily in South Korea, where it saw massive success. It is a fact that the MMORPG market in South Korea is huge, and while there are players from other regions that play it, it hasn't gained much popularity in the USA, Europe and other regions. 

Another thought is that some players may not be satisfied with its endgame content as there may be a lack of updated dungeons, quests, events, among other things. Others may have issues with the monetization model, which could be forcing players to pay to progress, leading to an unlevel playing field. 

Is the game dying?
---
It's hard to determine if Lost Ark is dying. However, it is fair to say that the statistics don't look good. As mentioned earlier, Lost Ark is one game that was heavily anticipated before its release, and it was expected to be a game-changer in the MMORPG genre. The low numbers, however, show that it hasn't panned out as anticipated.

Conclusion
---
In summary, Lost Ark is an MMORPG game that ticked all the right boxes at the time of its release. However, with the decline in the player base, it seems like the hype for this game has waned. The low player count could be solely because the game has failed to capture the attention of the international market as it did the South Korean region. The decline could also be due to the lack of post-launch content that is disappointing the players. Does this mean the game is dead? Not necessarily. As long as there are loyal players that find joy in playing it, Lost Ark still has some life left in it.
