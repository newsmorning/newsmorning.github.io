Microsoft is attempting to persuade an increasing number of users to choose Edge as their default browser. Despite the fact that Edge has significantly improved since its initial release, it is not error-proof. And you may have a variety of problems, including the inability to download files.
 
There’s no need to switch back to Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox if this has occurred in your case. We’ll walk you through the process of checking and configuring Edge settings so that you can resolve the issue in no time. 
 
Beginning with a simple troubleshooting procedure such as restarting your computer, you may work your way through the rest of the options on this list. This cleans up minor problems and terminates any background processes that may be interfering with downloads.
 
Furthermore, make sure that you have enough disk space as some users reported the Edge couldn’t download disk full error. But now let’s see how Edge compared to Chrome and then move on to the list of solutions.
 
## Is Edge better than Chrome?
 
There are numerous similarities between Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. As competitors, they are not known for allowing extended periods of time between their respective products. They are nearly neck and neck in the race. 
 
If you’re used to the Google Chrome web browser, the Microsoft Edge user interface will look and feel very familiar to you (and vice versa). For example, you can have many tabs open in each window and bookmark pages that you find particularly interesting.
 
Chrome does not have a built-in vertical tab capability that is comparable to Edge’s. The Chrome Web Store has several plugins that can provide a similar appearance. But none of them are as smooth to work with as Microsoft Edge’s native vertical tabs.
 
Additionally, Edge and Chrome allow you to create tab groups. There isn’t much of a difference between the two browsers in this regard – both allow you to provide color and a name for each group, and both will automatically shuffle your tabs so that tabs from the same group will be adjacent.
 
When Edge was originally released, Microsoft claimed that it was 112 percent faster than Chrome, according to the company. 
 
It’s difficult to determine how reliable this specific statistic is, but a large number of users from all across the web have conducted their own testing and come to the same conclusion: Edge is significantly quicker than Chrome.
 
For example, Avast evaluated a variety of browsers and discovered that Edge performed far better than Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Vivaldi.
