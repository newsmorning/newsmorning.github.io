Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Opened My Macbook Air After 2 Days of Not Using It - The Screen Was Totally Bizarre!

When I opened my Macbook Air after 2 days of not using it, I was excited to get back to work. However, what I saw on the screen was completely unexpected and bizarre. The display was filled with weird patterns and glitchy lines, and it was almost impossible to read anything on it.

At first, I thought it was a software glitch or a virus attack, so I tried rebooting the system. But the problem persisted, and the screen remained strange and distorted. I tried adjusting the brightness and contrast settings, but that did nothing to solve the problem.

I was starting to panic. I had important work to do, and I couldn't afford to waste time trying to fix my Macbook. So, I decided to search online for some troubleshooting tips.

After browsing through several forums and user groups, I discovered that the problem was not a software issue, but a hardware one. Apparently, the connectors that connected the display to the logic board had become loose, causing the distortion on the screen.

Armed with this information, I decided to take my Macbook to a professional repair shop. The technician confirmed my suspicion and was able to fix the problem quickly by reseating the connectors.

I was relieved and amazed at the same time. Who would have thought that a loose connection could cause such a bizarre and scary display on my Macbook? I learned that it's always important to be aware of the hardware components of our devices, and not just rely on software updates and antivirus software.

In conclusion, if you ever encounter a weird or distorted display on your Macbook or any other device, don't panic. Take a deep breath and try to troubleshoot the problem by doing some research or seeking professional help. You never know, it might just be a loose connection that needs fixing.

## Chosen Solution
 I got it fixed at Apple two weeks ago because it wasn’t turning on. They replaced the power bank and my track pad. I used it Wednesday night for ChemQuiz and put it back in my backpack. I haven’t used it since I put away. I didn’t drop it or get water damage.

 Typically this is either an issue with the cables which run from the TCON board to the display. Or an issue with the TCON board itself. Sometimes, you can get the machine to behave if you only open the lid a little. This typically points to a cable issue.
Sadly these cables are not easily replaced, or repaired, so the most likely solution will be replacing your screen. Did you pay Apple for the repairs that you just had done? Or is your machine covered by AppleCare+? There is a possibility they may cover this under the 90 repair warranty they offer if your repair was paid out of pocket, but typically that only covers the parts they replaced. And they would not have had to remove the display for either of the repairs you had done. Definitely covered by AppleCare+ if that applies.
I would recommend connecting it to an external display just to verify it's still showing an image as normal. But I expect that will work properly.
