Are you fed up with your kettle breaking down unexpectedly? Does it seem like there’s always something wrong with it? Well, worry no more! In this article, we’ll give you a step-by-step guide on how to repair common kettle breakdowns.\nStep 1: Check the Power Cord One of the most common issues with kettles is a damaged power cord. It’s important to check the cord regularly for any signs of wear and tear. If you notice any frayed wires or exposed cables, it’s time to replace the power cord.\nHere’s how to do it:\nUnplug the kettle from the socket. Use a screwdriver to open the base of the kettle. Trace the power cord from the base to where it connects to the kettle’s heating element. Carefully disconnect the wires from the heating element. Remove the old power cord by gently pulling it out from the base. Attach the new power cord by connecting the wires from the heating element to the corresponding wires on the new power cord. Close the base of the kettle and screw it shut. Plug the kettle back in and test it to ensure it’s working properly. Step 2: Descale the Kettle Another common issue with kettles is the buildup of limescale, which can affect the kettle’s performance and make it less efficient. To descale your kettle, follow these simple steps:\nFill the kettle with equal parts water and vinegar. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Pour out the mixture and rinse the kettle with clean water. Fill the kettle with clean water and boil it once more to remove any remaining traces of vinegar. Step 3: Replace the Heating Element If your kettle isn’t heating up properly, the problem may be a faulty heating element. Here’s how to replace it:\nUnplug the kettle from the socket. Use a screwdriver to open the base of the kettle. Locate the heating element and disconnect the wires. Remove the old heating element and replace it with a new one. Reconnect the wires to the new heating element. Screw the base back on and plug the kettle back in to test it. In conclusion, by following these three easy steps, you can say goodbye to kettle stress and keep your appliance working like new. Regularly checking the power cord, descaling the kettle, and replacing the heating element when necessary will not only save you money but will also extend the life of your kettle.

This is the case when the device is energized and the differential circuit breaker “trips”. There is unfortunately not much to do, except to change the resistance. The resistance can also be switched off. Not necessarily tripping at the switchboard, but the water does not heat up. To check the resistance value, you must use an ohmmeter. Knowing that the power of the kettle is between 920 and 1100W, R=U²/PR=230²/1100=48 ohms. Our resistor actually measures 54 ohms Another failure may be due to the cable or the socket of the base. To check its condition, simply use a multimeter to test the continuity between the terminals of the wall socket and the socket fixed to the base. To reach the contacts of this one, press on the protection of the central contact. This releases the other 2 contacts. The other causes come from the M/A device, located in the tank. We describe in step 2, a problem encountered on this element. One of the frequent failures is the resistor insulation fault.

We describe in step 2, a problem encountered on this element.\n1024\nStep 2\nOn/off device The problem was that the water would not heat up when the switch was turned on! After successfully testing the resistance and continuity of the power supply at the base, the remaining element that could be a problem is the M/A device located in the tank. It turned out that after removing the part and disassembling it completely, the plate responsible for cutting the high temperature circuit was permanently activated. This plate is in contact with the resistor support. It heats up and deforms. While deforming, it presses on a plastic “finger” which presses on another plate which cuts the circuit. Apparently, for some reason, the finger was pressing on the plate continuously, which prevented the current from passing. After having shortened the length of the “finger” to approximately 1mm, the normal function was restored. It is possible that in the long run, the plate loses its original characteristics (elasticity) and the device malfunctions. Important: when reassembling, do not forget to coat the plate with thermal paste to promote heat conduction with the resistor support.
