You Won't Believe What Happened to This Acer Aspire E5 - It's Completely Powerless!

As a student, your laptop is your lifeblood. You use it to take notes, research papers and projects, and stay in touch with your classmates and professors. But what happens when your trusty laptop suddenly becomes powerless? That's what happened to my Acer Aspire E5, and it's a cautionary tale for everyone who relies on technology to get through the day.

It all started when my Acer Aspire E5 stopped charging. At first, I thought it was just a glitch or a loose cord, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't get it to charge. I took it to a repair shop, and they diagnosed the problem as a faulty charging port. They said they could fix it, but it would take a few days.

I was in the middle of a major project, so I couldn't afford to be without my laptop for that long. I decided to buy a universal charger in the meantime, and that's where things went from bad to worse. When I plugged in the new charger, my laptop shut off completely. No matter how many times I tried to turn it back on, it remained completely powerless.

I was devastated. My laptop was only a year old, and I had taken good care of it. I couldn't imagine what could have gone wrong. I took it back to the repair shop, and they confirmed my worst fears: the universal charger had somehow fried the motherboard.

I was faced with a difficult decision: pay for an expensive motherboard replacement, or buy a new laptop altogether. After weighing my options, I decided to bite the bullet and buy a new laptop. I couldn't risk putting more money into a laptop that had already let me down.

In the end, I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of investing in quality technology and being careful with what I plugged into my devices. It's a mistake that cost me time and money, but hopefully, my experience can help others avoid making the same mistake.

So if you're relying on a laptop to get you through the day, take good care of it, invest in quality technology, and be careful what you plug into it. You won't believe what can happen if you don't.

## Chosen Solution
 my laptop acer aspire e5-471-35sl bios flash and now power is not open .not charging

 First of all, try removing the battery and turning it on with only the powersupply plugged in.
If that doesn't work try to insert the powersupply and wiggle it a bit, if it feels like the part that the powersupply is plugged into (the dc connector) is loose or follows the power plug without resistance to the wiggle, it will probably need to be replaced or resoldered onto the motherboard.
If neither is an issue you might have to open up the laptop and take out any removable hardware and periodically try to power it on. if you get to a barebones motherboard with not poweron then it is probably the laptops motherboard that is defective.
