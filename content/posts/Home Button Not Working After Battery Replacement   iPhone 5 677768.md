Title: You Won't Believe What Happened after I Replaced My iPhone 5 Battery - My Home Button Stopped Working!

Introduction:

It's a common practice among iPhone owners to replace their battery when its performance starts to deteriorate with time. However, what if the replacement of the battery leads to a more significant issue such as the home button not working? That's precisely what happened to me after I replaced my iPhone 5 battery. I was shocked and amazed by this sudden change in my phone's behavior.

Body:

I decided to replace my iPhone 5 battery as it was already showing signs of wear and tear. I went to a local smartphone repair shop and got the battery replaced. The phone was working fine, but after a few hours, I noticed that the home button was not working correctly. At first, I thought it was a minor issue and tried restarting the phone, but it didn't help.

I did some research online and found out that the replacement of an iPhone battery might affect the phone's other components, such as the home button. The home button issue is related to the metal plate found under the battery. When the battery is removed, it's easy to damage this part, leading to the home button malfunctioning.

After talking to the repair shop where I replaced my battery, they confirmed that the problem was caused by the damage of the home button's metal plate. They advised me to replace the home button, which is an expensive and time-consuming process.

Conclusion:

Replacing an iPhone battery is a necessary and relatively easy process that can be done by anyone. However, as I have experienced, it can also lead to other issues that might be more complicated and expensive to fix. So, before replacing your iPhone battery, it's essential to be fully aware of its potential impact on your phone's other components to avoid any unpleasant surprises. Always ensure that you seek the help of a professional and reliable phone technician to avoid unnecessary damage to your device.

## Chosen Solution
 Exactly what it says in the title. I have been back and checked all connections and connectors. Of which are all in place. Can anyone shed some light on this issue?
Thanks

 This post is useless if someone has the knowledge to replace the battery they ought to know how the home button works "gold prongs". What is the resistor next to the u3 chip? That's kinda important if you want to order one and how do you replace such a small resistor (small chip size).  I'll try to get back if I ever find the real solution and not "bad home button" arrg! the battery replacement doesn't effect the home button!  Btw if you need a work around you can go to "settings-general-accessibility-AssistiveTouch-on, and that will give you a home button on the screen (software) - it's a pain in the a** but it's a work around for now.

 Did you touch the two pins that are situated on the lighting port?

 Same issue here.  Thought I pushed the two pins back out enough but no luck.  Then I applied pressure on the screen where the pins are and it worked so I went back and pushed the pins out more.  Works fine now.

 how do i do this?

 agh. i was sweating bullets for a bit with this problem. ultimately, I touched the two gold prongs down by the lightning port, as stated above. i was touching only one, like a dummy, with the screwdriver. then, i got my head straight and realized i'm supposed to touch them simultaneously with the screwdriver. once I did this, the home button activated on the screen. i can't believe my phone is still operating.. the screen had become unglued from the screen assembly, and overall my battery replacement was a messy sweaty nervous affair. thank goodness i stumbled on this fix.. which would be obvious for an electrician, but not for me.

 This question is a bit old, but in my experience fixing the classic iPhone 5 battery replacement pry damage every day, I've seen one or two phones that don't have the classic iPhone 5 pry damage, but do have pry damage *just* to the tiny resistor next to the U3 chip.  This little guy is required for home button function only.   In those cases, replacement of that resistor solved the home button problem.   Of course this is very unusual---only a possibility if shorting of the two gold contacts on the lightning connector does not activate the home button.

 I replaced my battery in my iPhone and thought problem solved. Then I realized home button not working. After trying all the stuff online and with no success I reopened my iPhone and noticed that I had bent down the two gold contacts while I was trying to pull my battery out. You'll see them just below battery. I took a very small sewing needle and pried them up.  The problem was they weren't making contact with home button contacts on screen side of phone. All fixed!

 The two gold prongs are just below the leftmost of the circled screw heads.

 First check to make sure the home button is working when you short the two contacts on top of the speaker housing.
Update
Take a look at step 28, iPhone 5 Speaker Enclosure Replacement
Touch both contacts with your screwdriver.

 I just replaced my battery as well and noticed after I was done the home button no longer worked. Everything went fine as far as taking it apart.
I've replaced many parts on iPhones on all gens and never had a problem.
I did touch the two pins together to test the home button but nothing at all happens. I even put back the original battery but still nothing. I metered the contacts on the home button on the LCD and it shorts fine.  Both pins are good but again even shorting them directly does nothing any help would be great, thanks
Btw power buttons and everything else work fine it's just the home button.

 If you have shorted the two gold prongs that's on the lighting port and it's not activating the screen then it's a faulty lighting port

 I have a 5s, will this fix work? Aldo I don't know what pins need to shorted.

 I've had the same problem and shorting the two gold pins makes the phone wake... do I need to replace the home button?

 Also had the same problem on a 5C.  shorting pins worked.  However reassembling and power cycling still did not bring it to life.  I raised the pins a bit, no effect.  What worked was shutting the phone off, then powering it back on by holding home and power.  The apple logo appeared, disappeared, then reappeared while holding down both home and power.  I released the buttons, let the phone boot up and all is well!  I figure this is some sort of hard reset process with the phone off.

 I had same problem.  Using the verbal descriptions, was finally able to figure out where the gold connectors was.

Be very careful when bending the connector pin to raise its height.
I bent mine too much.  When bending it back lower, the pin broke.
So I had to solder some tin onto the base of the pin (where the pin used to be) --> very tough to get it just right, but eventually was successful.
Now I have my home button functional again...

 Make sure that home buttons 2 connector are not broken when it connects.

 I had this problem, but also the audio out jack wasn’t working and the battery wasn’t charging. Going back in for the umpteenth time I went to reconnect the battery and noticed that the connector right above the battery connector was not fully seated. Re-seated that large multi-pin connector and all was well.
