However, it can also be a frustrating experience, especially when you’re faced with the infamous Windows glitch. This is a glitch that can cause Firefox to crash, freeze, or not start at all. If you’re tired of pulling your hair out over Firefox, here are five genius fixes to help you solve the problem and get back to browsing with ease.\nClear Your Browser Cache The first thing you should try is clearing your browser cache. Over time, your browser cache can become cluttered with outdated files, which can slow down your browsing experience and cause Firefox to crash. To clear your browser cache, click on the hamburger icon in the top-right corner of your browser window and select “Options.” Next, click on “Privacy \u0026 Security” and scroll down to the “Cookies and Site Data” section. Click on “Clear Data” and check the box next to “Cached Web Content.” Click on “Clear” to delete your browser cache.\nDisable Browser Extensions Extensions are a great way to customize your browsing experience, but they can also cause problems with Firefox. If you’re experiencing issues with Firefox, try disabling your browser extensions and see if that solves the problem. To disable your browser extensions, click on the hamburger icon in the top-right corner of your browser window and select “Add-ons.” Next, click on “Extensions” and disable all of your extensions by clicking on the toggle switch next to each one.\nUpdate Your Graphics Drivers Outdated graphics drivers can cause problems with Firefox, especially if you’re using a newer version of the browser. To update your graphics drivers, open your device manager and locate your graphics card. Right-click on your graphics card and select “Update Driver.” Follow the prompts to update your graphics drivers.\nDisable Hardware Acceleration Hardware acceleration is a feature that uses your computer’s graphics card to improve the performance of Firefox. However, it can also cause problems with the browser, especially if your graphics card is outdated or incompatible. To disable hardware acceleration, click on the hamburger icon in the top-right corner of your browser window and select “Options.” Next, click on “General” and scroll down to the “Performance” section. Uncheck the box next to “Use recommended performance settings” and uncheck the box next to “Use hardware acceleration when available.”\nReset Firefox If all else fails, you can try resetting Firefox to its default settings. This will remove all of your bookmarks, passwords, and other personal data, so make sure to back up any important files before resetting the browser. To reset Firefox, click on the hamburger icon in the top-right corner of your browser window and select “Help.” Next, click on “Troubleshooting Information” and click on the “Refresh Firefox” button.\nIn conclusion, the infamous Windows glitch can be frustrating when using Firefox, but there are several solutions available to solve the problem.

Microsoft Edge is the only browser that natively works with Windows, hence it is expected that it is the most compatible with Microsoft.\nWith that said, many other browsers work great on Microsoft devices, and Firefox is one of them.
