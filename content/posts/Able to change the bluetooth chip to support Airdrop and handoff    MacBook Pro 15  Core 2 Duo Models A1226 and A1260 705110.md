Revolutionary hack allows for Airdrop and Handoff on old Macbook Pro models - here's how to do it!

Apple's Airdrop and Handoff features are a great way to share files and complete tasks efficiently between your iOS and MacOS devices. Unfortunately, the Airdrop and Handoff features are not supported on older MacBook Pro models. This can be frustrating for users who own an older Macbook Pro and would like to make use of these features. However, there is good news. A revolutionary hack has been developed to make AirDrop and Handoff work on old MacBook Pro models. In this article, we will show you how to do it.

First, it's essential to understand that the Airdrop and Handoff features require a Bluetooth 4.0 enabled Macbook Pro. Most of the older MacBook Pro models do not have this feature.

To check if your MacBook Pro has Bluetooth 4.0, click on the Apple logo in the top left corner of the screen, select "About This Mac" and choose "System Report." Under "Hardware" and "Bluetooth," you'll be able to see your MacBook Pro's Bluetooth status.

To enable Airdrop and Handoff on your old MacBook Pro, you'll need to buy a USB Bluetooth dongle. One of the most popular bluetooth dongles that work well with a MacBook Pro is the "Plugable USB Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Micro Adapter."

Insert the Dongle into the USB port of your MacBook Pro. A Bluetooth icon should appear in the menu bar.

Next, you need to install some software that will enable Bluetooth 4.0 LE support. You can download the required software through the official website of BluetoothAutomation, which is called "Bluetooth Explorer."

Once downloaded, extract the file from the downloaded zip. Then go to Bluetooth Explorer located in the Utilities folder under Applications. Right-click on Bluetooth Explorer and select "Open." The system will appear with a warning due to the developer ID. However, it is safe to proceed.

In the Bluetooth Explorer menu, select "Tools," and then click "HCI Controller Selector." In the dropdown, select "USB Bluetooth HCI Adapter" (or whatever the name of the dongle you bought is).

Now click on "Tools" and then select "Debug" and navigate to "HCI Log." Select "Display All Info" and hit "Start."

At this point, all you have to do is restart your MacBook Pro. When your MacBook Pro has been booted up again, go to your settings, and enable Airdrop and Handoff. Voila! You should be ready to go.

In conclusion, while it can be frustrating not being able to use Airdrop and Handoff on older MacBook Pro models, it is possible to activate these features on your old Macbook Pro using a simple USB dongle and some software. Following the steps we outlined above will enable you to take advantage of these great features and streamline your workflow. So, give it a try and see how it works for you.
