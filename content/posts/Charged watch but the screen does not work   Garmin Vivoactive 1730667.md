# Garmin Vivoactive: Wearing Your Charged Watch But Screen Dead? Find Out How To Fix It Now!

Are you a fitness junkie or an athlete who loves wearing smartwatches, particularly the popular Garmin Vivoactive? Has your Vivoactive watch ever experienced an issue where the battery is fully charged, but you cannot see anything on your screen?

Don't worry; this is a common problem faced by Garmin Vivoactive users. Fortunately, you don't have to hire a professional to fix it for you. With some simple troubleshooting steps, you can easily tackle the issue in no time.

Here are some methods you can try to fix your dead screen problem on Garmin Vivoactive.

## Method #1 - Check for Firmware Update

Garmin regularly pushes firmware updates for Vivoactive that address common issues, bug fixes and add new features. So, if your Garmin Vivoactive's screen is dead, it's recommended to check if your watch has the latest available firmware version installed.

To check if you have the latest firmware on your Vivoactive, go to the Garmin Connect mobile app and check for available updates. If there is an available update, follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

## Method #2 - Perform a Hard Reset

Performing a hard reset on your Garmin Vivoactive is another solution you can try to fix your dead screen problem. This method is straightforward and does not require any technical knowledge.

To perform a hard reset, follow the steps below:

1. Hold down the side button and the bottom-left button.
2. Release both buttons when the screen turns off.
3. Immediately press and hold the side button until the watch turns on.

After you have followed these steps, your watch will turn on and start working again.

## Method #3 - Check if the Watch is Paired Correctly

Another reason why your Garmin Vivoactive may have a dead screen is if it's not paired correctly. If you are using a smartphone with your watch, there may be some connectivity issues that are causing your watch's screen to remain dead.

To fix this issue, check if your Garmin Vivoactive is correctly paired with your smartphone. Ensure that your watch is in range and that the Bluetooth connection is enabled on both devices. Try disabling and re-enabling the Bluetooth connection on both devices and see if it fixes the problem.

Conclusion

If you are experiencing a dead screen problem on your Garmin Vivoactive, try the methods mentioned above to fix the issue. These methods are easy to perform and do not require any technical knowledge.

If the above methods do not work, try contacting Garmin's customer support for further assistance. With their help, you will be able to fix your watch's issue and start enjoying your workouts as soon as possible.

## Chosen Solution
 When the watch is plugged I can see the screen ON and the batery is 100% charged. However, unplugged the screen is OFF and the watch seems like it has no battery. 
any idea of the problem? Thank u

 WHILE YOU'RE CHARGING YOUR WATCH, PRESS AND HOLD DOWN POWER BUTTON UNTIL IT POWERS ON..... I hope this working for you right away. Pls tell me if it worked for you

 Sorry! I just saw the answer!
It didn’t work, It powers off because in the computer you can listen how the device is turned off and then again the computer recognises it again. But as soon as I unplugged it, the screen is again off.
Thank u for your help

 Hiiii! I have the exact same problem with a Garmin Vivoactive 3 , did you find a solution to repair that ? I don't know what to do about it… Thank you so much!
