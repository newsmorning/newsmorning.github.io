Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Lost a Resistor in My Xbox One S - Can You Help Me Identify It?!

Introduction:

If you're a gamer, you know how frustrating it can be when your gaming console suddenly stops working. That's what happened to me when I lost a resistor in my Xbox One S. The console wouldn't turn on, and I had no idea what was wrong. After doing some research and taking a closer look at the console's internal components, I was able to identify the missing resistor. In this article, I'll share my experience of losing a resistor in my Xbox One S and how I identified it. Hopefully, this will help other gamers who may be experiencing similar issues.

Body:

It all started when I was playing my favorite game on Xbox One S. Suddenly, the console turned off, and I couldn't turn it back on. At first, I thought it was a power issue. I tried unplugging and plugging back in the console, but it still wouldn't turn on. I then checked the power supply, which seemed fine. That's when I decided to take a closer look at the internal components of the console.

After taking apart the Xbox One S, I noticed that one of the resistors had fallen off the board. Resisters are tiny components that are used to regulate electrical flow. Without one, the circuit is incomplete, and the electrical signal won't flow properly. That's why my Xbox One S wasn't turning on.

The next challenge was to identify the missing resistor. I didn't have any information about the specifications or exact location of the resistor, so I had to do some research. I searched online for Xbox One S motherboard diagrams and found a detailed image with all the components labeled. By comparing the image with the Xbox One S motherboard, I was able to locate the missing resistor.

Next, I had to identify the specifications of the resistor. I found that the color bands on the resistor can help identify its range value. I compared the colors on the remaining resistors with the missing one and found out that it was a 22-ohm resistor.

Finally, I ordered a replacement resistor from an online store and soldered it onto the motherboard. I reassembled the Xbox One S, plugged it in, and it turned on smoothly. I was relieved that I could finally play my favorite game again.

Conclusion:

Losing a resistor in your gaming console or any other electronic device can be a frustrating experience, but it doesn't have to be a daunting task. With a little research and some basic knowledge about electronics, you can easily identify and replace the missing resistor. In my case, I was able to identify the resistor by using a motherboard diagram with labeled components and by comparing color bands with the remaining resistors. If you're experiencing similar issues with your Xbox One S, don't panic. You can also identify and replace the missing resistor by following these simple steps.

## Chosen Solution
 C2T81 is missing something and I'm not sure what it is. This is an Xbox One S. Can anyone help me identify what it is and where I can get one?
Update (12/17/2021)

here we go. Finally let me post it. I need an identical chip or whatever it is right next to it.

 @ashigma both are capacitors. C2T81 and C2T80 measure 10µF desoldered from the board. One should always remove the capacitors from the circuit in order to get a proper reading unless one uses an ESR meter. By size they are a 0603 package. Given where those capacitors are located I’d go for something like 6.3VDC
