Introduction:
The Xbox Game Bar on Windows 11 has become a go-to hub for gamers to connect with friends, monitor their system performance, and capture their gameplay. However, like any other software or application, it is not immune to errors and issues. In this article, we will explore five tested fixes that can do wonders for your Xbox Game Bar on Windows 11.

1. Reinstall the Xbox Game Bar:
If your Xbox Game Bar is not working or causing issues, the first solution is to reinstall it. To do this, go to the Start menu, search for the Xbox Game Bar, right-click on it, and select the Uninstall option. Once uninstalled, restart your PC, and reinstall the Xbox Game Bar from the Microsoft Store.

2. Allow the Xbox Game Bar through firewall:
In some cases, the Xbox Game Bar may be blocked by the Windows Firewall, preventing it from functioning properly. To fix this, go to the Start menu, search for Firewall, select the Windows Defender Firewall, and click on the Allow an app through firewall option. From there, find the Xbox Game Bar and make sure it is allowed to communicate through the firewall.

3. Update your graphics card driver:
Outdated or corrupted graphics card drivers can cause issues with the Xbox Game Bar. To update your graphics card driver, go to the Start menu, search for Device Manager, find your graphics card, right-click on it, and select the Update driver option. This process may take some time, but it is worth it to ensure your Xbox Game Bar runs smoothly.

4. Disable Game Mode:
Game Mode is supposed to improve gaming performance on Windows 11, but it can cause issues with the Xbox Game Bar. To disable it, go to the Start menu, search for Settings, select the Gaming option, and turn off Game Mode.

5. Clear Xbox Game Bar cache:
If none of the above solutions work, clearing the Xbox Game Bar cache may do the trick. To do this, go to the Start menu, search for Run, and type %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.XboxGamingOverlay_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache. From there, delete all the files and folders within the LocalCache folder.

Conclusion:
The Xbox Game Bar is a powerful tool for gamers, and these five tested fixes can help optimize its performance. Whether it's reinstalling the Xbox Game Bar or simply allowing it through the firewall, these solutions can help gamers get the most out of their Windows 11 experience.

## Why is Xbox game bar not working on Windows 11?
 
As it turns out, there is a possibility that the process of upgrading to Windows 11 will result in the deactivation of this feature.
 
Here are some more possible causes of the Xbox game bar issue to consider:
 
➡ Game bar is disabled altogether – It makes no difference if you had the app enabled before upgrading to Windows 11. Many reported that this feature may deactivate automatically during the upgrade process.
 
➡ Gpedit disabled the app – Additionally, if you are using Windows 11 PRO or if your PC is a member of an organization that is structured locally, it is conceivable that the Xbox game bar feature will be restricted by a Local Group Policy.➡ Xbox game bar component is corrupted – Another reason why the feature won’t start even if you specifically enabled it is because of dependency corruption. Microsoft, fortunately, has a few mitigating measures for this type of problem.➡ Xbox game bar is disabled from Registry – This behavior can be expected if a hard-coded Registry value has been set to disable this component. When you update to Windows 11, the enforcement (which is represented by a DWORD value) will be carried over as well.➡ IeFrame Dynamic Link Library is corrupted – This problem might occur as a result of a DLL requirement (ieframe.dll) that the Xbox game bar relies on while running on Windows 11.➡ Faulty Windows update – Another likely culprit responsible for this strange behavior with the Xbox game bar is a partially incompatible upgrade that ends up interfering with the broadcasting component of the console’s operating system.
