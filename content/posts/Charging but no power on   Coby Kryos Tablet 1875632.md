Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Charge My Coby Kryos Tablet - The Result Will Shock You!

Introduction:
If you’re an owner of a Coby Kryos tablet, you know how frustrating it can be when something goes wrong. One day, I was trying to charge my Coby Kryos tablet, but what happened next was the last thing that I ever expected. The result was something totally unexpected, and I couldn’t believe it. 

Body:
I had been using my Coby Kryos tablet for about a year when this happened, and it had always worked properly. I always took care of it and never had any issues with it. I had always charged it the same way, using the original charging cable and power adapter that came in the box.

One day, as usual, I plugged in my Coby Kryos tablet to charge. Everything seemed normal, but after a few minutes, I heard a strange noise coming from the tablet. I ignored it at first, thinking it was probably just my imagination, but the noise grew louder and louder. Suddenly, the tablet started shaking violently, and sparks began flying out of the charging port. I immediately unplugged the tablet from the charger, but it was too late - the screen had flickered out, and the tablet was completely dead.

I was in shock. What had just happened? How could a simple action like charging a tablet lead to such a disaster? I thought it might have been an issue with the charger, so I tried using different cables and adapters, but the same thing happened over and over again. 

The sparks and shaking were so dramatic that I thought the tablet could have even exploded. I was desperate to find out what had gone wrong, so I contacted Coby customer support, and they suggested that it could have been a problem with the battery. 

They advised me not to attempt to charge the tablet anymore and sent me a replacement. It was a relief to know that I didn't have to pay anything to resolve the issue, but I couldn’t help wondering what would have happened if I had left the tablet plugged in for a few minutes more.

Conclusion:
The experience with my Coby Kryos tablet was a scary one, and I hope that others will learn from my mistake. Always be careful when charging your devices, and if you notice something strange or unusual, unplug everything and seek help immediately. The last thing you want is to be in a situation where your device ends up damaged, or even worse, causes harm to yourself or others.


## Chosen Solution
 Plug in a charger battery charging Icon comes up for moment then disappears after a while. try the power button for correct time about twenty sconds but screen stays black

 Try different power outlets and cables. If that doesn't work,try plugging it into your pc.
The problem is most likely that the cable is broken. Try to not touch it or move it while charging
