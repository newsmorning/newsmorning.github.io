### Step 5: Reconnect the LCD screen

## Chosen Solution
 I have a bought a new phone online that has a one pixel wide vertical row of stuck pixels.  (They appear a dark magenta colour against a white background)
Is this likely to be a cable connection issue that I might be able to fix myself?
Thanks,
Simon

 I highly doubt it.  This sounds like an issue with the lcd panel itself.  If there is any type of return policy, I would use it.
