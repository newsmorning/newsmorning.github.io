# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Edit A PDF File With These 4 Simple Tricks!

PDF (Portable Document Format) files have become the standard for sharing and exchanging documents on the web. The format is widely used in schools, businesses, and other organizations as it is a reliable way to ensure that the layout, fonts, and images of your document will remain the same across different platforms.

But editing a PDF file can be a real headache. It requires a specialized software that can be costly and complicated. Luckily, there are some simple and effective tricks that you can use to edit your PDF files without having to purchase any new software. In this article, we will show you four easy ways to edit a PDF file.

## Trick 1: Use Google Docs

Google Docs is a free online office suite that allows users to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. But did you know that you can also use Google Docs to edit PDF files?

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your browser and navigate to the Google Docs website.
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click on "New" in the upper-left corner of the screen.
4. Select "File upload" and choose the PDF file that you want to edit.
5. Open the file in Google Docs by clicking on it.
6. Once the file is open, you can make the necessary changes using the editing tools provided by Google Docs.

After you've made your edits, you can download the file as a PDF again and save it to your computer.

## Trick 2: Use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is a free PDF viewer that comes with a built-in editor that allows you to make several different types of edits to your PDF files. Here's how to use it:

1. Open your PDF file in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
2. Click on the "Edit PDF" tool in the right-hand pane.
3. Choose the type of edit you want to make from the toolbar – you can add text, images, and links, among other things.
4. After you've made your changes, click on the "File" menu and choose "Save" to save the edited PDF file.

## Trick 3: Use Microsoft Word

Microsoft Word is a popular word processing software that can also be used to edit PDF files. Here's how:

1. Open Microsoft Word and click "File" > "Open."
2. Choose the PDF file you want to edit and click "Open."
3. When prompted to convert the file, click "OK."
4. Make your desired changes to the document.
5. Click "File" > "Save as" and choose "PDF" from the drop-down menu.

This method works best with PDF files that are mostly text-based, as it can be difficult to retain formatting and images.

## Trick 4: Use an Online PDF Editor

Online PDF editors such as Smallpdf, PDFescape, and Sejda are great options if you don't want to download any software to your computer. Here's how to use one:

1. Open your browser and navigate to an online PDF editor.
2. Upload your PDF file to the editor.
3. Use the editing tools provided by the editor to make the changes you need.
4. After you've made your edits, click the "Download" button to download the edited file to your computer.

One thing to keep in mind is that online PDF editors rely on an internet connection, so if you don't have a stable connection, you may experience difficulties using these editors.

## In Conclusion

Editing a PDF file doesn't have to be a daunting task. With these simple tricks, you can make the necessary changes to your PDF file without having to spend a lot of money on software or spend hours learning how to use complicated software.

When John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe, developed the Portable Document Format (PDF), he wanted to make it easier for people to distribute documents without the need to print them. Surprisingly, it didn’t turn out to be very user-friendly.  
 
Not only were the files large in size, but the format didn’t support external hyperlinks and could only be viewed with a special PDF viewer. Over time, functional improvements were included in various versions of the PDF file format that made it easier to work with.  
 
However, it’s still not as easy to make changes to or edit a PDF document like most other text documents, because they weren’t really meant to be edited.
 

 
Most PDFs start from a source file in another native format like Word, and are converted to the PDF file format for distribution. If you’re not the original author, it’ll be a little more difficult to edit the file either because the source file isn’t available to you, or you don’t have the right apps to edit it.
 
The good news is that there are several ways to edit a PDF document. We’re going to show you four great tools that make it possible.
 
## Using Adobe Acrobat
 
Adobe Acrobat is the most obvious tool for editing PDFs. Like most of Adobe’s offerings, you can easily get it online by purchasing the Standard or Pro versions of the editor. 
 
If you don’t want to pay for it, you can sign up for the 7-day free trial and access Acrobat DC’s powerful features.
 

To start editing your PDF, you need to open the file in Adobe
Acrobat. 


 

Go to File>Open.
 

Select the Edit PDF tool in the right pane.
 
Click on the text or image you’d like to edit. Acrobat will display all the editing tools you’ll need to format your text.
 
Note: If there’s a particular font you want to use, and it’s neither installed nor embedded in your system, you can’t edit any text in your PDF document. For embedded fonts, you can only change the font size and color.  
 
Save your file once you’re done making the changes.
 
You can use Adobe Acrobat to edit PDF documents in Windows and Mac clients. Plus, if you have an Acrobat Pro DC subscription, you can edit PDFs on Android and iOS from anywhere, on any device using theAcrobat Reader mobile app.
 
## Using Microsoft Word
 
If you already own recent versions of Microsoft Word (2013 or later), it’s the easiest and quickest way to edit a document based on an existing PDF.  
 
The two formats are different in nature, which means some information like tables with cell spacing, font effects, form-fill-in features and more may get lost in translation.
 
First, open Microsoft Word program and click File.
 
Click Open to select the PDF file you want to edit from the document window.
 
You’ll get a message saying Word will convert your PDF to an editable document, and its contents into a format that Word can display. It won’t change the original PDF though.  
 
Click OK. Make the changes you want on the document, and click File>Save to save it back to PDF format.
 
## Using Google Docs
 
This is a quick and easy to use alternative to editing PDF files. Here are the steps you need to take to edit PDFs in Google Docs.
 
Log into Google Drive with your Google account. Click New on the upper left hand side.
 
Select File Upload.
 
In the document window, find the PDF file you want to edit and click Open. Once the upload completes, click Recent on the left pane to find the PDF you just uploaded.
 
Right click on the PDF file name and select Open With>Google Docs.  
 
A new, editable Docs file will be created.  
 
Double click on it to make the necessary changes and download it as a PDF. You can also email or share it with others using a shareable link.
 
## Using a PDF Editor
 
Finding a PDF editor that lets you edit, add or modify text and images, sign your name, fill forms and more isn’t easy. However, there are some online PDF editors you can use with your web browser to edit your PDF file and then save it back to your computer or cloud storage, or share it with others.
 
Not all PDF edits offer the same features; some have restrictions on what you can and can’t do, but you can use more than one tool to process the same PDF document. They’re also not as fully featured as desktop PDF editors like Acrobat so they won’t convert perfectly, meaning you’re left with odd formatting styles and incorrect translations.
 
One of the many online PDF editors you can use isSejda PDF editor. A bonus fact is it can run entirely on your web browser, or you can get the desktop version.
 
Just go to Sejda PDF’s website, and click PDF Editor under the Edit & Sign column.
 
There, upload the PDF file you want to edit. You can click on the green Upload PDF file button to upload your file from your computer.
 
You can also select a location by clicking the drop down menu and upload from Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive or a Web Address (URL).
 
Note: The desktop edition doesn’t let you add PDFs by URL or online storage services.
 
You now have an editable format of your document.  Like Acrobat, Sejda PDF editor offers a menu with editing tools you can use to format your text using different fonts, colors, or sizes.  
 
Make the changes you want and then click Apply Changes (green button) at the bottom center of your screen.
 
Don’t worry about your files getting stored on the internet. Sejda deletes all uploaded files automatically after two hours. You can also delete it yourself by clicking Delete Files icon.
 
These methods are a good start to PDF editing and should be enough to cover the needs of most users.
