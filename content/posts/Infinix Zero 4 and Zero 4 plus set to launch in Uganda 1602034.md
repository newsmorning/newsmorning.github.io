# Revolutionary Phones Alert: Infinix Zero 4 and Zero 4 Plus are finally coming to Uganda, Miss at Your Own Risk!

The Ugandan mobile phone market is about to experience a revolutionary shift, as Infinix Mobility, the Hong Kong-based smartphone manufacturer, is set to launch its latest flagship models, the Infinix Zero 4 and Zero 4 Plus, in the country.

The two phones, which were unveiled at a lavish event in Lagos, Nigeria, in November 2016, have been generating a lot of buzz in the East African region, thanks to their impressive features and affordable pricing.

The Infinix Zero 4 is a 5.5-inch smartphone, powered by an octa-core MediaTek Helio X20 processor, with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of internal storage, and a 16-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilization (OIS). It also features a fingerprint scanner, a USB Type-C port, and a 3200mAh battery that supports fast charging.

The Infinix Zero 4 Plus, on the other hand, is a larger 5.9-inch smartphone, with similar specs to the Zero 4, but with a more powerful octa-core MediaTek Helio X25 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and a whopping 20.7-megapixel rear camera with OIS and a dual-tone LED flash. It also has a larger 4000mAh battery that supports fast charging.

Both phones run on the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system, with Infinix's custom XOS user interface, and support for 4G LTE network connectivity.

With such impressive features and specs, the Infinix Zero 4 and Zero 4 Plus are expected to give other high-end smartphones a run for their money, despite their relatively affordable price tags.

Infinix Mobility has been rapidly expanding its presence in Africa, with a strong focus on Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria. The company's entry into the Ugandan market is long overdue, considering the growing demand for affordable yet high-quality smartphones in the country.

The Infinix Zero 4 and Zero 4 Plus are likely to appeal to tech-savvy Ugandans who are looking for powerful smartphones that offer value for money. These phones are ideal for multitasking, gaming, photography, and social media, among other uses.

If you're in the market for a new smartphone, then you should definitely consider the Infinix Zero 4 and Zero 4 Plus. These phones are set to revolutionize the Ugandan mobile phone market, and missing out on them would be a big mistake.

Infinix Mobility has a strong reputation for producing great smartphones that deliver on performance, and the Zero 4 and Zero 4 Plus are no exception. So don't miss this opportunity to get your hands on these amazing devices, and take your mobile phone experience to a whole new level.

Owning a high quality smartphone at a pocket-friendly cost is an amusement for any smartphone user. Infinix Mobility has perfected this art, and is slowly closing in to the top spot on the African market.
 
Infinix has  garnered a wide fan-base from the Infinix Note 3, the Hot 4, and the Hot 4 Lite devices, all of which have registered success stories with their users. And this April, Infinix mobility might launch the Zero 4 and Zero 4 plus in Uganda.
 
The Infinix Zero series is the name that represents Infinix’s flagship series. Dating back in 2014 when the Infinix Zero launched, there has since been the Zero 2, and the Zero 3. The Zero 4 launched in November 2016, with some African countries already acquiring it. It comes as an upgraded version of the Zero 3, though in twin series of the Zero 4 and the Zero 4 Plus.
 

 
## The Display
 
The Zero 4 comes with a 5.5-inch IPS screen, with the Zero 4 Plus having a 5.98-inch Full HD Display. Both are enveloped in a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4 coating which protects the screen from damage on fall. It also allows for easier swiping and fluid finger motion over the display. The full Aluminum body implies a non-removable back cover, which has on it a fingerprint scanner that allows you to unlock your smartphone securely.
 
## The Camera
 
Depicted as the main feature on the Zero 4, this camera shoots better photos than any other Infinix mobile on the market. The new Pro manual adjustment camera interface is embedded within, adding to Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) and faster laser autofocus. OIS reduces blurry photos and shaky videos that result from the hand shaking. This will probably result in better quality photos and fewer retakes.
 
The Zero 4 comes with a 16 MP sensor on the rear, a 4-times sharper zoom, and an 8 MP front camera with an LED flash. The Zero 4 Plus has a 20.7 MP rear camera and a 13 MP front camera with improved detail to the environment when taking selfies.
 
## The Inside
 
The two devices boast of more powerful processors compared to their predecessor. The Zero 4 comes with a MediaTek Helio X20 Octa-core processor that runs on 3 GB of RAM. The Zero 4 Plus comes with a 64-bit MediaTek Helio X20 Deca-core chipset that runs on 4 GB of RAM which meet the capacity needs of shooting and storing HD photographs and videos. Both processors are powerful, yet saving user battery.
 
The Zero 4 has a 3200mAh battery, while the Zero 4 Plus comes with a 4000mAh battery; both of which support Infinix quick charge technology known as ‘X-Charge’. The battery is full within an hour and a third of charge, implying that it takes you less time to get more battery percentage that lasts longer.
 
Both phones run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with Infinix’s XOS Chameleon for a finer user experience, and both have on-board storage space of 32 GB, extendable up to 128 GB on SDcard. The Zero 4 accepts dual Nano SIM, while the Zero 4 Plus accommodates a hybrid SIM setup of Micro + Nano with the Nano SIM slot available for SD-card insertion.
 
## Connectivity
 
Each of the devices supports 4G LTE connectivity with up to 150 Mbps download, Bluetooth v4.0, Wi-Fi, GPS and USB v2.0, as well as USB On-The-Go. Other sensors and controls supported include digital compass, Accelerometer, Proximity sensor, Light sensor, and Gyroscope.
