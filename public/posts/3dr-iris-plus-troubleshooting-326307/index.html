Has your 3DR Iris Plus been acting up lately? Are you having trouble getting it to fly properly? Don’t worry - you’re not alone. Many drone enthusiasts experience flight issues from time to time. Fortunately, most problems can be solved with just a little bit of troubleshooting.\nHere are three easy fixes to help get your 3DR Iris Plus back in the air:\n1. Calibrate the Compass If your 3DR Iris Plus is having trouble staying on course, it might be because the compass needs to be calibrated. It’s a fairly simple process, but it does require a little bit of patience.\nFirst, make sure the drone is on a flat surface and that there are no metal objects nearby. Then, power up the drone and wait for the LED lights to turn green. Next, use the controller to access the calibration menu, and follow the instructions to calibrate the compass.\nOnce the calibration is complete, power off the drone and restart it. This should help improve its stability in flight.\n2. Check the Propellers If your 3DR Iris Plus is wobbling or shaking during flight, it might be due to damaged propellers. Check each propeller for cracks, chips or other signs of wear and tear.\nIf any of the propellers are damaged, replace them with new ones. It’s also a good idea to check the motor mounts for any signs of damage. If the motors are loose or wobbly, tighten the screws or bolts to secure them in place.\n3. Update the Firmware If all else fails, it might be time to update the firmware on your 3DR Iris Plus. Firmware updates can improve the drone’s performance, fix bugs and add new features.\nTo update the firmware, connect your drone to your computer using the USB cable. Then, download the latest firmware from the 3DR website and follow the instructions to install it.\nMake sure to fully charge the drone’s battery before attempting to update the firmware, and don’t disconnect the cable until the process is complete.\nBy following these three troubleshooting tips, you should be able to get your 3DR Iris Plus back in the air in no time. Happy flying!\nStudent-Contributed Wiki An awesome team of students from our education program made this wiki.\nEnsure that the drone is fully charged.Verify the battery connector is fully seated and if the drone powers on. If the drone is still not turning on, reference the “Why is the drone not turning on?” section.\nIf all motors are spinning except for one, the motor that isn’t spinning might be broken and will need to be replaced. See our motor replacement guide HERE.Verify that nothing is blocking the motion of the motor (or propeller) from spinning freely.\nIf all the motors are spinning except one, and visual inspection reveals damage to that motor’s wire harness, the motor will need to be replaced. See our motor replacement guide HERE.\nIf the drone is powered and attempted flying commands have no response (no motor movement) there are two possible issues:There might be a communication problem between the controller and the drone.The power distribution panel (distributes power from the battery) inside the drone is malfunctioning and will need to be replaced. See our PDP board replacement guide HERE.\nIf the device is new, the battery might be slightly charged or near empty.If the device isn’t new, the battery might have drained over time after long periods of non-use.Check the battery to see its charge level, and if it’s low, simply charge it. If the drone still isn’t powering on, the battery is most likely damaged and will require replacement.\nA faulty connection to the controller can be caused by a defective battery.Test the controller by removing the battery then returning it and attempting to turn on the controller. If this doesn’t work, place the battery in other devices to ensure that it functions. If the battery works in another device, but not the controller, the controller will likely need replacement.\nThe internal components might be damaged from being crushed during packaging, getting wet, or being dropped too often.Once you’ve identified what’s damaged, follow the replacement guide specific to that component.\nIssues with camera connection can be caused by a faulty camera.Test the camera by connecting it to another device.For a GoPro, you can test it by connecting the camera to your phone. If the camera is unable to connect, the camera itself might have an issue.\nAnother reason for connection issues with the camera is a faulty cable.To replace the cable, refer to the replacement guide HERE.\nIf either one or both gimbal axis aren’t moving, a faulty connection might be the cause. A cable connects the gimbal control board to the gimbal motors, ensure that the cables are securely plugged in on both ends. If the connectors feel loose in their slots or the cable sheathing is visibly damaged, you might need to replace the cable.\nTwo motors control the gimbal’s movement. Feel the gimbal motors, if one is damaged it may feel very hot.If only one axis of the gimbal moves, then it is likely that the stationary motor is damaged. Replace the motor with this guide HERE.\nIf neither gimbal axis functions, and don’t feel hot, nor have damaged cables, the gimbal board might be damaged.A control board is wired to the gimbal motors and is located above the gimbal motors but under the drone. If the gimbal isn’t working, but the motors aren’t damaged, the gimbal board might need to be replaced.\nIf a flashing yellow status LED is visible, it’s likely the sensors didn’t calibrate properly upon startup. Follow these steps for proper calibration:Connect the battery to the quadcopter.Wait at least 10 seconds before moving the drone (Even closing the battery door can misalign the sensors.Wait until the status lights show blue and red before moving.\nThere are two measurements required to pass the GPS Pre-Arm check: GPS Lock (Signal Strength) and Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP, signal accuracy).GPS Lock denotes the number of satellites connected to the drone at one point.The IRIS Plus prefers 5 satellites at once, however, it’s possible to fly with less with the risk of possibly disconnecting during flight.You can see the lock status and satellite count on the controller’s data display. To do so, press and hold the controller’s DN button.HDOP must be below a certain level to pass a pre-flight check.High HDOP levels can result from satellite positioning, buildings and mountains, atmospheric effects, electromagnetic interference, or the time of day.This can occur even if the drone has a strong GPS lock.To improve signal strength, operate the drone in an open space with a clear view of the sky and wait for the drone to acquire either a strong GPS lock or lower HDOP. Moving from location to location can increase the amount of time acquisition takes.\nThe double-flashing yellow status light means the drone is failing a pre-arming safety check, causing the motors to remain inoperative.To see a specific error code, connect the drone to a ground station to view the flight data display. (Groundstation: Any computer with Mission Planner installed).\nIf the pre-arm check signals an RC Calibration error, use Mission Planner to calibrate the remote.If you don’t see any response in the calibration screen from moving the controller sticks, ensure that both the controller and copter are powered and the copter is connected to Mission Planner.Remove the top shell before performing this process.Ensure both the controller and the quadcopter are powered. Check the RC Receiver and if there is no green light follow these steps to rebind the receiver to the transmitter.Disconnect the battery and turn off the controller. Make sure that both on/off switches on the controller are set to the off position.Hold the F/S button on the back of the controller, and power on the controller while holding the F/S button down.Hold the F/S button on the receiver down, and connect the battery to the drone while holding the button down.Now when powering the controller and receiver, the green status LED on the receiver should be visible, if so replace the top shell and reattempt arming.\nIf the drone isn’t showing any lights it might be a battery issue. Ensure the battery is charged and the connector is completely fastened into the drone’s connector.Please see the “Why is the drone not turning on?” section for may ways to diagnose this issue.\nThere might be a communication problem between the controller and the drone.The power distribution panel (distributes power from the battery) inside the drone is malfunctioning and will need to be replaced.
