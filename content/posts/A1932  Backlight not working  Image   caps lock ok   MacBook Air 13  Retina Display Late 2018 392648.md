If you have recently purchased a Late 2018 MacBook Air and are experiencing an issue where the display is flickering, you are not alone. This is a common problem that can be frustrating, but fortunately, there are a few ways to fix it.

## Software Fix

The easiest and most common way to fix the display flicker on your Late 2018 MacBook Air is by updating your software. Apple has released a few software updates that specifically address this issue. Here's how you can update your MacBook Air software:

1. Click on the Apple menu and select "System Preferences".
2. Click on "Software Update".

3. Immediately press and hold the Command + Option + P + R keys.
4. Hold these keys until your Mac restarts and you hear the startup sound twice.
5. Release the keys and allow your MacBook Air to start up.

Once your MacBook Air has restarted, check to see if the display flickering issue is resolved. If not, move on to the next solution.

## Chosen Solution
 Macbook Air 13” A1932.
As I was using my macbook it made one “click” sound and the backlight went dark. I can see the apple logo when turning on if I shine a flashlight on it. Caps lock is lighting up and so does the keyboard. I have tried the resetting stuff with the multiple button presses, but no change. I opened the backplate to look at the logic board and did not see any obvious damage, in fact it looks new since I only used it like 4 times.
Is there anything else I can check on this model?
I have read about a backlight fuse, but I don’t know how it looks or where it is located, could somebody guide me to it?

 Check the display cable and see if it's loose. If it's not, replace the display.

 wordi pressi the backlight fuse is reference designator F8400. It is a 32V 3A fuse in a 0603 package. Location on your logicboard as shown. Measure continuity with a multimeter or your can measure for proper voltage with the board power applied.

If it is not the fuse,you will have to check deeper for the cause. Use the schematic for the backlight as provided. Do not forget to check your display connector since a lot of short circuit happen right there. Post some images of your logicboard (both sides) with your QUESTION so we can see what you see.
