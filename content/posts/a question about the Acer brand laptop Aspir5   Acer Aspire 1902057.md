# Is the Acer Aspire 5 Laptop Really Worth the Hype? Find Out Here!

Technology has reached new heights, and the world is becoming more dependent on it. From businesses to personal use, laptops have become an essential gadget. And with an overwhelming number of options available, it can often become a daunting task to choose the best one. The Acer Aspire 5 is one of the latest buzzes in the market. But it begs the question, is it worth the hype? Let’s sit down and explore the Acer Aspire 5 to find out.

## Pros

### Design

The design of the Acer Aspire 5 is slim and sleek, which enhances its portability. It has a 15.6-inch display screen available in 1920 x 1080 resolution. The keyboard is backlit, making it easier for typing in different settings. The touchpad is accurate and sensitive, allowing for easy navigation. Overall, the Aspire 5’s design is aesthetically pleasing and works well in practical terms.

### Performance

One of the most critical aspects when considering a laptop is performance, and the Acer Aspire 5 stands out in this department. It has an Intel Core i5-8265U processor with 8GB DDR4 memory that offers a smooth computing experience. The Aspire 5 also has an NVIDIA GeForce MX150 graphics card that supports faster processing and seamless video playback. The laptop handles heavy software such as Adobe Creative Cloud or AutoCAD without any lag. So if you are looking for a laptop for video editing, graphic design or gaming, the Acer Aspire 5 will not disappoint.

### Battery Life

Battery life is another crucial aspect, and the Acer Aspire 5 shines in this area. It has a 4-cell battery, and the manufacturers claim that it can last up to nine hours. Consumers reported a battery life of more than seven hours during moderate use. This is an excellent feature for people who are always on the move or work for long hours.

### Price

Finally, arguably the most significant factor affecting laptop purchases is the price. The Acer Aspire 5 laptop is affordable when kept within the context of similar quality laptops in the market. For such an efficient laptop, it falls on the lower end of the scale, which potentially seals the deal for students or people on a tighter budget.

## Cons

### Display

One of the drawbacks of the Acer Aspire 5 is its display. Despite having a 1080p resolution, some consumers reported a grainy image quality. The colors also tend to look slightly dull, which can be a concern for people who require high-quality image processing. However, this could be due to the fact that most laptops within this price range may suffer from a lack of 100% accurate color reproduction.

### Heavy Weight

Considering that the Acer Aspire 5 has a slim design, it is a little heavy, weighing over four pounds. It makes it less portable than other thinner and lighter models. However, the extra bulk comes from the durability of the device in terms of its sturdiness.

## Conclusion

The Acer Aspire 5 laptop is a device that has a lot going for it. It has an aesthetically pleasing design, robust performance, long battery life, and an affordable price. Although it may have a few minor flaws like less than accurate color processing and heaviness, it makes up for these with its super-efficient computing power.

If you are looking for a laptop that provides an all-around satisfactory experience, then the Acer Aspire 5 is definitely worth the hype. It is an excellent device for students, office workers, or even amateur graphic designers or gamers. Overall, it would be a great investment, making it a must-have for those who depend on their computers for daily use.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a  sticky A  key. How to fix?

 You can try and get a syringe and fill it with isopropyl alcohol (95% or better) and spray it under the key cap and then use the key. Worked on an old Mac for me.
