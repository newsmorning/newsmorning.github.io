Title: SHOCKING! Discover Why Your 1997-2005 Buick Century Driver's Side is Lukewarm While Others Are Sizzling Hot!

Are you the proud owner of a 1997-2005 Buick Century and have noticed that the driver's side of your car is only lukewarm while the other side is sizzling hot? If you have, don't be alarmed as this is a common issue faced by many Buick Century owners. In this article, we will be delving into the cause of this problem, and how you can fix it.

The cause of the problem lies within the heater core. The heater core is responsible for heating the cabin of your car by transferring hot coolant from the engine into the heater core. The heater core then blows hot air into the cabin, which warms it up. It is located behind the dashboard on the passenger side of the car. Due to the design of the car's heating and cooling system, the driver's side of the car is further away from the heater core, meaning that it receives less heat than the passenger side.

So, how can you fix this issue? There are a few different methods you can try:

1. Check your coolant levels

Make sure your coolant levels are topped up. Low coolant levels can cause less heat to be transferred to the heater core, resulting in less hot air being blown into the cabin.

2. Check the hoses connected to the heater core

Check the hoses connected to the heater core for any leaks or blockages. If there is a leak, the hot coolant won't be able to reach the heater core, resulting in less heat being produced. If there is a blockage, the hot coolant won't be able to flow freely, also resulting in less heat being produced.

3. Check the blend door actuator

The blend door actuator is responsible for directing the hot air to the different vents in the car. If it is faulty, it may not be directing enough hot air to the driver's side vent. You can replace the blend door actuator yourself, or you can take it to a mechanic.

4. Install a second heater core

If you've tried all of the above methods and are still not receiving enough heat on the driver's side, you can install a second heater core. This will ensure that both sides of the car receive an equal amount of heat.

In conclusion, if you're a Buick Century owner and have noticed that the driver's side of your car is only lukewarm while the other side is sizzling hot, don't panic. The problem is a common one and can be easily fixed by checking your coolant levels, checking the hoses connected to the heater core, checking the blend door actuator, or installing a second heater core. By following these steps, you can ensure that both sides of your car are equally comfortable, and you can enjoy driving your Buick Century to the fullest.

## Chosen Solution
 My mother in law bought a used Buick Lucerne 2006 a few months ago. The ac works great, the fan runs good at full strength, but I can’t get any heat except for the drivers side vent and it’s not much. what I’ve done so far is
checked coolant level, replaced thermostat, flushed the heater core, verified actuators move each change, bled air from the system, and flushed entire coolant system. Both hoses on the heater core are hot, but only the driver side is even warm. What’s happening here!? Also I’ve been having to add a little antifreeze each time I test it, but I’m  not getting drips or anything like it’s leaking out

 If the hoses going to it are both hot then it sounds like you've got coolant flowing through it. You can disconnect the hoses from the heater core and blow some air through to confirm if you have doubts. It sounds like the door isn't moving properly. The actuator might move but if something is broken (like the part where it attaches to the door) then the actuator will move without actually moving the door. Do you have a borescope you can put in there to see if the doors are moving?
