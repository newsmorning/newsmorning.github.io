# Discover the Shocking Reason Why Your iPhone 8 Won't Turn On - and How to Fix It FAST!

Are you one of the iPhone 8 users who have encountered a very frustrating issue of your phone not turning on? It can be quite alarming to realize that your phone is not working, especially if you need it for important tasks. However, before you panic, it is crucial to understand why this happens and how you can fix it.

After thorough research and consultation with iPhone experts, we have uncovered some shocking reasons why your iPhone 8 won't turn on. But, more importantly, we will guide you on how to solve this problem quickly.

## Possible Causes of iPhone 8 Not Turning On

### Battery Issue

The most common reason for an iPhone 8 not turning on is a battery issue. In some cases, the battery drains completely, and the device will not turn on until it is recharged. However, there can be a glitch in the system that stops the battery from charging, making your phone totally unresponsive.

### Broken Charging Port or Cable

Sometimes, an iPhone 8 not turning on could be due to a damaged charging cable or the port. The charging port is where you plug in the charger, while the cable is what connects the charger to the phone. If either of these is damaged, you will not be able to charge or turn on your iPhone 8.

### Software Issues

Another possible reason why your iPhone 8 won't turn on is a software problem. This can happen if there is a bug or malware in your iPhone's operating system that triggers a shutdown or prevent it from turning on. 

## How to Fix Your iPhone 8 Not Turning On 

### Check the Charger and Charging Port/Cable

The first thing to do is to eliminate charging problems. Ensure your charger is not faulty and the charging port/cable is in good condition. Try using a different cable or charger and check if the charging indicator comes on. Alternatively, use a different outlet to see if the charger is the problem. 

### Perform a Forced Restart

A forced restart can solve most software issues on your iPhone. Press and hold the Volume Up button, and then press and release the Volume Down button quickly. Next, press and hold the side button until the Apple logo appears. Release the button and wait for your iPhone to reboot.

### DFU Restore

If the above solutions fail, use the DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode to restore your iPhone 8. This is an advanced solution, so ensure you follow the steps correctly. Connect your iPhone 8 to a computer and launch iTunes. Press and hold the side button and Volume Down button for eight seconds, and then release the side button while still holding the volume button down. If done correctly, a message should appear on iTunes indicating that it has detected an iPhone in Recovery mode. Choose the option to restore your iPhone.

### Contact Apple Support

If none of the above solutions fix your iPhone 8, it's time to seek professional help. Reach out to Apple support for assistance. They will guide you through the steps or recommend a repair service.

Final Thoughts

A non-responsive iPhone 8 can be quite frustrating, but before you start panicking, try the simple solutions outlined above. If you're still experiencing the problem, reach out to Apple support for further assistance. Remember, it is always essential to keep your device up-to-date, as software updates often address bugs and security issues that could affect your iPhone's performance.

## Chosen Solution
 I've got an iPhone 8 that worked fine, it had no issues with booting,  running or charging. The screen was slightly cracked and the glass on  the back case. It was dropped. But like I said everything ran fine for a  long time.
I ordered a new screen original and the back housing. (The back  housing I ordered was with all small parts and components but they later  messaged me it was out of stock so I said cool just send me the housing  and I'll transfer all the small parts over). So the back housing came  and I transferred everything over. When I went to boot up the phone to  turn it on it went into boot loop. Turned it off, re checked everything  and found the very small flex plug which I believe is the Antenna flex  to be broken. (I have attached a photo of it so you can see which one  I'm talking about).
After  trying to turn the phone on again it did not respond or turn on. I found  it strange that one second its in boot loop and next second its  unresponsive. So I measured the voltage in the battery, was fine 4.13 v.  I tried plugging power into the charging port and neither did the  charging logo appear on the screen. Nothing at all.
So I'm thinking:
1- Screen cant be dead cause it just worked.
2- Tried plugging it into itunes encase screen was dead but phone was  on (that was not the case itunes did not detect it so phone was off).
3- Battery is fine as tested with multi-meter.
I have tested all the pins by known good readings for the J6400.
Most where fine apart for these which I found a bit high.
Pin 6 - 0.802
Pin 8 - 0.802
Pin 20 - 0.805
Pin 22 - 0.802
Pin 24 - 0.802
Pin 25 - 0.721
Pin 26 - 0.907
Pin 27 - 0.721
Pin 39 - 0.612
Pin 41 - 0.612
(All diode readings)
And maybe  50, 53, 54 and 56 (all at 2.32)  is a bit high what do you think?
From your experience by the readings I provided do you think there is  an issue with the U2700 power IC? Or could it be an issue with the original charging port when it was removed and put back into new housing??
What I have done is ordered a new housing with all small elements  already installed. If that does not resolve the issue will try replacing  the power IC. I know that it regulates power to the phone and also charging, so if the phone is unresponsive it could be due to this.
Please let me know your opinion on all this.
I appreciate it.

Here is the picture I forgot to post

 Here is J6400. I donâ€™t know where you got J4101 from. If you are trying to sort out a charging problem you are looking in the wrong spot.

 Housing replacements are notoriously difficult. The ones that come pre-populated can have low quality, if not outright defective flexes and doing it yourself exposes you to a ton of variable if things dont work.
As for your diode readings, the ones you have to worry about are low numbers or shorts (except for ground ;-). Did you put the red probe on ground and probe with the black lead? Your numbers seem high.
I would start by testing a bare-bones setup. Start by disconnecting the battery first (always!). Then disconnect the digitizer, LCD, front camera, rear camera and home button extension flex. Now re-connect the battery; you should only have the battery and Lightning Dock flex connected. Connect a known-good, preferably Apple-original Lightning cable to an iTunes enabled computer.
Does iTunes recognize your phone? If so, then you should re-connect one flex at a time until the phone stops working. I would start with the Home button flex first, then add the rear camera, LCD & Digitizer then from camera flex.
If the bare-bones setup does not get recognized by iTunes, then you most likely have a logic board issue. You could send it (or find a local) to a repair shop that specializes in micro-soldering repair.
