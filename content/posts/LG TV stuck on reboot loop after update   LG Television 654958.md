Is Your LG TV Trapped in a Non-Stop Reboot Nightmare? Find Out Why and How to Fix It NOW!

If you're an LG TV owner, you may have experienced a frustrating issue where your TV will constantly reboot without any apparent reason. This can be extremely frustrating, especially if you're in the middle of watching your favorite show or playing a game. This issue is not uncommon, and if you're facing it, you're not alone.

There are several reasons why your LG TV might be stuck in a non-stop reboot cycle. One of the most common reasons is a software malfunction. Like any other electronic device, your LG TV relies on software to operate correctly. If the software becomes corrupted, it can cause the TV to crash and constantly reboot.

Another common cause of a non-stop reboot cycle is overheating. If your LG TV isn't getting enough ventilation, it can cause the internal temperature to rise, triggering an automatic reboot. This is an important issue to address promptly because overheating can cause permanent damage to your television.

Alternatively, if you're using an external device such as a gaming console or cable box, it could be causing the rebooting issue on your LG TV. Sometimes, these external devices can cause your TV to malfunction and restart continually.

So, what can you do to fix this frustrating problem? Fortunately, there are several methods you can try that can help resolve the issue. Here are a few troubleshooting steps:

• Check for Software Updates – LG regularly releases software updates that address known issues and bugs. Checking for updates is the first step you should take in fixing the rebooting issue.

• Reset the TV – Performing a factory reset on your LG TV can help. Before resetting your TV, always ensure that you have backed up all your data and files, and disconnected any external devices.

• Clean the Ventilation Slots – If your LG TV is overheating, it's important to ensure that the ventilation slots are clear of all dust and debris. Vacuum the slots and the surrounding area regularly.

• Unplug Your TV and Devices – Sometimes, simply unplugging your TV and all external devices and waiting for a while before turning them back on can help fix the non-stop rebooting issue.

• Contact LG Support – If none of the above methods work for you, contacting LG support for assistance may be the best option. Your TV could have an issue that requires professional service.

In conclusion, a non-stop reboot cycle is not an uncommon issue for LG TV owners. While it can be highly frustrating, there are several methods for resolving the problem. By keeping your ventilation slots clear, checking for software updates, and performing a factory reset, you can significantly reduce the risk of your LG TV constantly rebooting. Finally, seek professional support if none of the above methods work. You deserve a properly functioning LG TV, and with a little effort, you can achieve it!

## Chosen Solution
 LG TV stuck on reboot loop after successful update.
model : 22lk3300-TH
after update the TV rebooted automatically but then showed LG LOGO screen for about half a second followed by a black screen for about 12 seconds and then reboots again.
this reboot loop never stops as long as it is connected to power line.
it is obvious that it need to be reprogrammed again but all methods need the TV to be booted properly before rollback or reinstalling the firmware again.
i have RS232 cable connected to my PC but yet i could not use terminal emulators to connect to the TV.
is there any way to flash its ROM ? (except buying a new mainboard)

 sure that depends on that?
I have the same problem and in the internet seems a known problem, caused by power board (bad).
Now they are building TVs for a little longer than 2 years, and LG has done well

 The same thing happened to me. Did you find a solution?
