## Chosen Solution
 Hi everyone
Like a lot of people, my keyboard is &&^&*d up. The AZEQSDWC keys show weaknesses. When I press the A key it displays IOUYT etc...
After several messages read from everywhere, despite attempts to repair software and OS, none is working. So I conclude that the problem is the keyboard.
I've seen/read a lot of tutorials, but one question always comes up:
Why do I have to change the whole TOPCASE and not just the keyboard?
For now, the Mac Book Pro mid-2012 is completely dismantled, keyboard in hand, and I don't see why I should change the complete case. So maybe can someone explain me this ?
Thanks again! :)

 From what you are describing when you press on a given key it does not show the correct letter on the screen. Did you have a liquid spill into the system? Is that why you’ve already taken the system apart?
As for your question: Do you need to replace the full uppercase  or can you just replace the keyboard alone?
Both will solve a keyboard issue! It’s just a matter of skills you have. The newer version systems use plastic rivets so its not as simple as the older models which used screws Bobby’s @thatretro video shows the older 2009/10 model which uses screws. The riveted models are much harder and you will need to tap the holes for replacement screws (as well as have the screws) to replace the rivets.
