# Shocking Little Nightmares 2 Ending Explained - You Won't Believe Why Six Betrayed Mono!

If you’re a fan of horror games, you’ve probably heard of Little Nightmares 2. The game, developed by Tarsier Studios, has taken the world by storm with its spine-chilling gameplay and storyline. Little Nightmares 2 is the sequel to its predecessor Little Nightmares, which was launched in 2017. The game's success led to its sequel's release, which promised to be even scarier and more intriguing than its predecessor. And, boy, did it deliver!

Many players were left scratching their heads after playing through the game's story and reaching the ending. The ending was a shocker, to say the least, and left players with more questions than answers. In this article, we’ll be explaining the Little Nightmares 2 ending in detail and answering some of your burning questions.

## The Plot

Before we dive into the ending, let’s recap the game's plot to get a better understanding of the ending. Little Nightmares 2 follows the journey of two characters, Mono and Six, as they navigate a world full of monstrous creatures and terrifying environments.

Mono, the game's protagonist, wakes up in a strange world, unable to remember anything about himself or his past. As he progresses through the game, he meets Six, a character from the first game, who agrees to help him on his journey. Six possesses a strange power; she can absorb the life force of other beings and objects, which restores her strength and power.

Throughout the game, Mono and Six work together to overcome different challenges and puzzles, often with Six's help. However, as they reach closer to the game's end, things take a turn for the worse.

## The Ending Explained

*Spoiler Alert! If you haven’t played the game yet, you should stop reading now.*

At the game's end, Mono and Six make it to the signal tower, which they were trying to reach throughout the game. Upon entering the signal tower, they find a strange broadcast signal that emits a hypnotic frequency that affects them both.

As Mono is drawn towards the signal, Six grabs him and absorbs his life force, unlocking a new power. With this new power, Six transforms into a nightmarish creature and leaves Mono behind. Mono then wakes up in the real world, wearing a paper bag mask, alongside other children who are also wearing masks. The scene suggests that Mono and the other children are part of a cult that worships the Signal Tower.

So, why did Six betray Mono? Based on the events that transpired in the game, it is evident that Six has been using Mono to reach the Signal Tower. She was aware of its power and wanted to use it to absorb its energy and strengthen herself. When Mono discovers the Signal Tower's true purpose, Six realizes that he might become an obstacle in her quest for power. Therefore, she chooses to absorb Mono's life force to gain a new power and leave him behind.

## The Conclusion

In conclusion, the Little Nightmares 2 ending is one of the most shocking endings we've seen in a while. The game's developers have done an excellent job of building up the suspense and keeping players engaged throughout the story. The ending leaves players with mixed emotions; they feel shocked, betrayed, and confused all at once.

However, the ending also leaves a lot of unanswered questions. What is the true purpose of the Signal Tower? What happens to Mono after being left behind? What is the cult's ultimate goal? These are all questions that players are left to ponder, and it's unclear whether the game's developers will ever provide answers to them.

If you haven’t played Little Nightmares 2 yet, we highly recommend giving it a shot. The game is a testament to the horror genre and offers a unique and thrilling experience for players. Although the ending may be confusing, it's also satisfying in a strange way, leaving players wanting more.
