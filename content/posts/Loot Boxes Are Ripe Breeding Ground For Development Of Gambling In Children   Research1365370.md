Shows: The Alarming Truth

Television has been around for several decades now, and it's a medium that has evolved significantly in that time. While it was once seen as a form of entertainment that brought families together, it has become a battleground for viewership ratings that are determined by the amount of sensationalism and controversy that can be packed into a show. As a result, some of the shows that are being aired today showcase a scary and alarming truth about society as a whole.

These days, it seems that television shows and media outlets are competing to see who can be the most provocative and create the biggest stir. There was a time when television was seen as a way to educate and inform, but now it has become a way to shock and entertain. Shows that offer an inside look at the lives of celebrities or showcase the most sordid aspects of society have become increasingly prevalent.

One of the most alarming aspects of this trend is that it seems to have a significant impact on the way people perceive the world around them. We live in an age where people can have their views and opinions reinforced or challenged by the click of a button, and television plays a significant role in this regard. The problem, however, is that the shows that are being produced today are often biased or one-sided, which can lead to a skewed interpretation of reality.

Another issue that arises from these types of shows is that they often sensationalize events or behaviors that are not only unhealthy but also dangerous. For example, reality shows that promote eating disorders or showcase extreme weight loss can have long-term negative effects on viewers. Similarly, shows that glamorize drug use, gang violence, and other harmful behaviors can have a profound impact on impressionable viewers.

In conclusion, it's essential to recognize that the shows that are being aired today tell a story about our society that should alarm us all. While some may argue that the media merely reflects society, there's no denying that these shows are shaping the way people think and feel about the world around them. We need to be mindful of the messages that we are sending, and we need to take responsibility for the content that we consume. It's only by doing so that we can begin to understand the real impact that these shows are having on our lives and the lives of those around us.

According to research by the Royal Society, loot boxes are in-game items that can be traded with real-world money. It can feature randomized content, and many games are usually played by adolescents. There are similarities between loot boxes and gambling that lead to concern in the development of the problem of gaming in adolescents. There already different research which had shown links between the both in an adult population.
 
To explain the connection the research carries an example of loot box in Counter-Strike Global Offensive, where a player can pay $2.49 to unlock a weapon case, there are chances such cases might contain an extremely rare or valuable skin that can be re-sold to the secondary market for many thousands of dollars. Similar to this player of FIFA 19 pay real-world money to buy players-pack that contains new faces in the team, some of these packs can have rare and valuable players. They might have an impact or on the team performance or not, but those players who are unaware of what the pack really contains will pay real-world money to find out. A simple case of the motivation behind making a purchase.
