Introduction:
The ZTE Zmax Pro is a budget smartphone that has been popular among users due to the features that offer some more costly devices. However, like any device, the ZTE smartphone has its own issues. One such issue is how quickly its battery and charger port can wear out. But, what happens to your ZTE Zmax Pro after replacing the battery and charger port? I decided to find out for myself.

Body:
After months of usage, my ZTE Zmax Pro started losing battery life, and the charger port no longer functioned properly. My device lost its ability to hold a charge, and I couldn't even charge it properly, making it impossible to use. I was left with little choice, so I decided to replace the battery and charger port. I hoped this would fix the issues I was experiencing.

After purchasing and replacing the battery and charger port, I was relieved to see that the ZTE Zmax Pro started working correctly. The battery life was much better than before, and the phone could charge without any issues. I was ecstatic, as I managed to get my beloved device up and running again.

More surprisingly, my phone was running smoother, and everything was faster. The sluggishness that had become a daily occurrence was no more. I wasn't expecting this, but replacing the battery and charger port had a significant impact on my smartphone's overall performance.

The device also stopped heating up while charging, which was another problem I was facing regularly. Previously, while charging, the device would heat up, which affected its performance. Now, there's no more overheating issue, and the device is working more efficiently than ever before.

Conclusion:
Replacing the battery and charger port worked wonders for my ZTE Zmax Pro. The device is now working like new, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that its performance had improved after replacing the battery and charger port. I would recommend this action to anyone experiencing similar issues with their ZTE Zmax Pro. It's a cost-effective solution that guarantees the efficient running of your device. It's a game-changer!

## Chosen Solution
 My ZTE ZMax Pro Z981 would only flash the white light while charging. But after a few hrs of charge, the screen would come on saying battery was empty. Please  allow phone to charge a few minuted before powering on. And had a red bar in the battery. After a bit the battery critically low warning would come on the bar would be orange then would begin to charge. It would only make it to 3% then it would stop charging. Powering it on it would come on at 1% then die. I thought it do to the battery so I had an old zmax pro with broken screen swapped the battery and the port, phone come right on when the phone died it did as it did before going right to red battery then orange then 1-3% and would not charge. Hard reset. Wiped cache. Still the same. Please help.
