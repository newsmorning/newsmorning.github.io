Title: Is Your iPhone 7's Home Button Constantly Buzzing? Find Out Why!

Introduction:
Have you noticed a constant buzzing sensation whenever you touch your iPhone 7's home button? It can be uncomfortable and irritating, but don't worry - you're not alone! Many users have reported experiencing this issue, and it's usually caused by a specific setting on the phone.

Body:
The iPhone 7 utilizes a taptic engine to give haptic feedback, which creates a tiny vibration when you interact with your device. This gives the user the feeling of pressing an actual button, despite the phone's home button being integrated into the touch screen.

However, if you've noticed that this vibration occurs even when you're not pressing down on the home button, you may have a setting called "System Haptics" enabled. This feature causes the phone to vibrate whenever you switch between menus, scroll through pages, or interact with the phone in any other way. 

While this feature can be useful for some users, it can become an annoyance for others. To disable System Haptics, open your iPhone's Settings app and navigate to Sounds & Haptics. From there, scroll down to the bottom of the screen and toggle off the System Haptics option.

If you've tried disabling System Haptics and are still experiencing a constant buzzing sensation, there may be a hardware issue with your phone. In this case, it's best to contact Apple Customer Support or take your device to an authorized repair center for further assistance.

Conclusion:
If you're experiencing a constant buzzing sensation coming from your iPhone 7's home button, don't panic. It's likely caused by a simple setting on your phone, and can be easily resolved. By disabling System Haptics, you can regain control over your device's haptic feedback and enjoy a more comfortable user experience.

## Chosen Solution
 Good day, I have an iPhone 7 which the screen was replaced but now the Home button is just continuously vibrating. When  I press and hold the button it just goes into a vibrating frenzy, this happens whilst holding the button. If I press the button as per normal it is like I am pressing the button Three times. Has anyone encountered this and possibly know of an easy fix for this?

 I have had two problems that are exactly like this..
Number 1 was waterdamaged and number 2 was just a damaged home button, and sorry to say you cannot fix an iphone 7 home button without soldering. Replacing it renders the home button useless.
