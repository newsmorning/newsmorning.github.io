Title: You Won't Believe How Much Money Monopoly is Secretly Stealing from You - Understanding Deadweight Loss

Intro: Have you ever played Monopoly and wondered why the game seems to drag on forever? Or why it can be so frustrating when you get stuck paying fines and taxes to the bank? Well, it turns out that Monopoly (both the board game and in real life) is actually stealing money from you through a phenomenon known as deadweight loss.

Section 1: What is Deadweight Loss?

Deadweight loss is a term used to describe the economic inefficiency that occurs when the cost of producing and consuming a good exceeds its value to society. In other words, it's when the cost of doing something becomes so high that it is no longer worth doing.

In regards to Monopoly (both the board game and in real life), deadweight loss occurs because the game is designed to create a situation where a single player has a monopoly on a particular resource or industry. This player can then charge higher prices for these resources, effectively stealing money from the other players who must pay these inflated prices.

Section 2: Monopoly in Real Life

Monopoly in real life can take many forms. For example, a company may have a monopoly on a particular product or service, such as internet service or cable television. Because there are no competitors, the company can charge higher prices for these services, effectively stealing money from their customers.

Another example of real-life monopoly is in the pharmaceutical industry. Because certain drugs are patented and cannot be legally produced by other companies, the pharmaceutical company that holds the patent has a monopoly on that drug. They can charge exorbitant prices for the drug, effectively stealing money from patients who need it.

Section 3: Monopoly in the Board Game

Deadweight loss also occurs in the Monopoly board game. The game is designed to create a situation where a single player has a monopoly on certain properties, such as Boardwalk or Park Place. Once a player has a monopoly, they can charge higher rents for these properties, effectively stealing money from the other players who must pay these inflated prices.

Other examples of deadweight loss in the Monopoly board game include fines, taxes, and fees that players must pay to the bank. These costs can add up quickly and effectively steal money from players who are forced to pay them.

Section 4: How to Fight Back Against Monopoly

There are several ways to fight back against monopoly and deadweight loss. In real life, consumers can choose to support companies that offer better prices and services, or they can advocate for regulations that prevent monopolies from forming.

In the Monopoly board game, players can work together to prevent a single player from gaining a monopoly on certain properties by making deals and trading resources. They can also negotiate to lower prices on rents and fees to prevent deadweight loss from occurring.

Conclusion: Monopoly and deadweight loss are pervasive issues that affect both real life and the board game. By understanding these concepts and working to prevent monopolies and deadweight loss from occurring, we can keep more money in our pockets and ensure a fairer economy for everyone.

## Deadweight Loss Definition
 
In a free market scenario, the price of goods and services depends majorly on their demand and supply. But sometimes, market inefficiency is caused by an external force—government laws, taxation, subsidies, monopoly, price floors, or price ceilings. In such a market, commodities are either overvalued or undervalued.

Key Takeaways

 
- Deadweight loss is the economic cost borne by society. It is a market inefficiency caused by an imbalance between consumption and allocation of resources.The deadweight inefficiency of a product can never be negative; it can be zero. Deadweight loss is zero when the demand is perfectly elastic or when the supply is perfectly inelastic.This market inefficiency is represented by the following formula:Deadweight Loss = ½ * (New Price – Original Price) * (Original Quantity                                                                                                 – New Quantity)

 
### Deadweight Loss Explained
 
A deadweight loss is a market inefficiency caused by a mismatch between goods consumption and demand. Due to the inefficiency, products are either overvalued or undervalued.

In such scenarios, demand and supply are not driven by market forces. Instead, demand and supply are moved artificially—by factors like taxation, subsidies, product surplus, consumer surplus, monopoly, oligopoly, price ceiling, and price floor. Highly elastic commodities are prone to such inefficiencies. Price changes significantly impact the demand for a highly elastic commodity.
 
Deadweight losses also arise when there is a positive externality. In such scenarios, the marginal benefit from a product is higher than the marginal social cost. Deadweight losses are not seen in an efficient market—where the market is run by fair competition. While the value of deadweight loss of a product can never be negative, it can be zero. Deadweight loss is zero when the demand is perfectly elastic or when the supply is perfectly inelastic.
 
### Causes of Deadweight Loss 
 
A deadweight inefficiency occurs when the market is unnaturally controlled by governments or external forces. Deadweight market inefficiency is caused by the following causes:
 
#### #1 – Price Ceiling
 
The government ascertains a maximum price for products—to prevent overcharging. However, price ceilings discourage sellers, as it curtails the possibility of earning high returns. Thus, price ceilings bring down goods supply.
 
#### #2 – Price Floor
 
Often, the government fixes a minimum selling price for goods. This increases product prices. Similarly, governments often fix a minimum wage for laborers and employees. But high wages result in job loss for incompetent employees.
 
#### #3 – Monopoly
 
When a single market player has a monopoly, the regulation of goods price and supply is unnatural. The selling price set by the monopolist is significantly higher than the marginal cost—the market becomes inefficient. Further, if customers are unable to afford the product or service—demand falls.
 
#### #4 – Taxation
 
When the government raises the taxes on certain goods or services, it influences the price and demand for that product. When taxes raise a product’s price, its demand starts falling. But this cuts into producers’ profit margin.
 
#### #5 – Subsidy
 
Governments provide subsidies on certain goods or services—bringing the price down. As a result, the product demand rises. However, this artificially created demand drives consumers to buy a particular commodity in more quantity.
 
#### #6 – Product Surplus
 
 When the market is flooded with excessive goods and the demand is low, a product surplus is created. When demand is low, the commodity’s price falls. Manufacturers incur losses due to the gap between supply and demand.
 
### Calculate Deadweight Loss
 
For calculations, deadweight loss is half of the price change multiplied by the change in demand. It is computed using the following formula:
 
Or, 
 
Here, 
 
- ∆P is the price difference.∆Q is the difference in the quantity demanded.P1 is the original price.Q1 is the original quantity.P2 is the new price.Q2 is the new quantity.

 
### Example
 
Let us assume that economic equilibrium will be achieved for a product at the price of $8.The demand at this price is 8000 units. The government then imposes a price floor; the price is increased to $10. At this price, the expected demand falls to 7000 units.
 
Based on the given data, calculate the deadweight loss.
 
Solution:Dead weight = 0.5 * (P2-P1) * (Q1-Q2)
 
                     = 0.5 * (10-8) * (8000-7000)
 
                     = $1000
 
Thus, due to the price floor, manufacturers incur a loss of $1000.
 
### Deadweight Loss Graph
 
The deadweight loss is the gap between the demand and supply of goods. Graphically is it represented as follows:
 
In the above graph, the demand curve intersects with the supply curve at point’ E,’ i.e., equilibrium. Equilibrium is a scenario where the consumption and the allocation of goods are equal. However, due to the price ceiling, the demand curve shifts to the left—P2 is the new price. Similarly, Q2 is the new demanded quantity. Subsidies also shift the demand curve to the left. In contrast, price floors and taxes shift the demand curve towards the right.

Deadweight inefficiency is the economic cost incurred by society when there is an imbalance of demand and supply. This could be an inefficient resource allocation caused by government intervention, monopoly, collusion, product surplus, or product deficit.
 
It is computed as half of the value acquired by multiplying the product’s price change and the difference in quantity demanded. If ∆P is the price difference and ∆Q is the difference in the quantity demanded, deadweight inefficiency is computed using the following formula:Deadweight Loss = ½ * (New Price – Original Price) * (Original Quantity                                                                                                 – New Quantity)
 
When a single market player enjoys a monopoly, the monopolist regulates goods prices and supply. When supply is low, consumers are charged exorbitantly—significantly higher than the marginal cost. When consumers lose purchasing power, demand falls.
 
It cannot be a negative value. But, it can be zero. This occurs when the demand is perfectly elastic or when the supply is perfectly inelastic.
