## Chosen Solution
 Hello I have a 2016 m5 12" macbook. Purchased a new USB C port from here, replaced, and still not working. The old USB C was really bad, dinged up, had some black goop on it, covering the connecting rods.
Anyway, still not working. I tried to d/c battery and plug in, and check the white LED on the logic board, and that is not going off. Any suggestions?

 Try another USB C port, might be faulty if the original one was in bad condition (since this sounds like the cause of the issue). If still not working, try the DC flex. Does it just say "battery not charging" with the charger plugged in, or something else?
