Is Your Macintosh SE 30 Monitor Hissing? Here's the Surprising Solution You Need to Know!

If you're using a Macintosh SE 30 computer, you know how reliable and long-lasting it can be. However, one issue that you may have encountered with your SE 30 is a hissing or buzzing sound coming from the monitor. This issue can be particularly frustrating because it can disrupt your work and distract you from your tasks.

Fortunately, there is a surprising solution that can help you get rid of this issue once and for all. Here's what you need to know.

First, it's important to understand why your Macintosh SE 30 monitor is hissing in the first place. The most common reason is that your monitor's flyback transformer is making the sound. This is a critical component of your monitor that generates the high voltage needed to power the screen. If the transformer is malfunctioning, it can produce a hissing sound.

So, what can you do about it? The good news is that you don't necessarily need to replace the entire monitor or go through a complicated repair process. Instead, all you need to do is adjust the monitor's brightness.

Yes, that's right. Simply adjusting the monitor's brightness can eliminate the hissing sound. Here's how to do it:

1. Turn off your Macintosh SE 30 computer and monitor.
2. Wait for at least five minutes to allow the monitor to cool down.
3. Turn on the monitor, but don't turn on the computer yet.
4. Press and hold the brightness button on your monitor.
5. While holding the brightness button, turn on your computer.
6. Keep holding the brightness button for a few seconds until you hear a click.

That's all there is to it! By adjusting the brightness in this way, you can reset the flyback transformer and eliminate the hissing sound. It's a simple solution that doesn't require any special tools or knowledge.

Of course, if you try this method and it doesn't work, you may need to seek professional help for your monitor. However, in many cases, adjusting the brightness can be enough to solve the problem.

In conclusion, if your Macintosh SE 30 monitor is hissing, don't panic! There's a surprising solution that can help you fix the problem without spending a lot of time or money. By adjusting your monitor's brightness, you can reset the flyback transformer and get back to work without any distractions. Give it a try and see if it works for you!

## Chosen Solution
 i bummed the back of the monitor and now when i turn it on it hisses but still makes the chime noise and starts up the hard drive , i really need a fix asap cause i was fixing this up for my dads b day and now its broken please help anyone .

 I agree with OldTurkey on bad caps.  We used to buy complete repair kits with all the caps but those aren't available any more.
I had a 1984 128k M0001 machine sent to me last month, first with bad RAM and after that the caps failed after 5 hours.  As I'm not up on this machine anymore I sent the power supply board to this guy and he did a great job on the repair with high quality parts, he is slow but does very good work, and his prices are very reasonable:

 jarrodebdon could be bad capacitors as well as an issues with the flyback transformer. Careful with that, lots of volts on the CRT part of the Mac. You'll have to open it up and isolate the sound a bit better. Take lots of pictures and post with your question. Use this guide for that. That way we can see what you see. Great place for schematics etc can be found right here. For your own safety, here is the Apple guide for that ESD-&-CRT-Safety.pdf Remember that all capacitors will still retain a current. discharge those before messing with it.
