### 2. Enable Cellular Data

Now, you should be able to attach Photos to Text Messages, Emails and WhatsApp Messages being sent from your iPhone.
 
### 3. Check Network Strength
 
A common reason for iPhone Not Sending Photos is due to poor network connectivity. Hence, take a look at the top-left corner of the screen to check and confirm that Network strength at your current location.

### 6. Disable WiFi Assist

Now, check to see if your iPhone is still having problems while sending photos.
 
### 7. Install Carrier Updates
