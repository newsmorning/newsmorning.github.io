# Windows users outraged as In-App purchases fail to work: Are you affected too?

Many Windows users were left frustrated and angry when they found out that in-app purchases on their devices were not working. This issue has affected various apps on the Microsoft app store, including popular ones like Netflix, Minecraft, and Candy Crush.

For the uninitiated, in-app purchases are a way for developers to monetize their apps by offering users additional features or content for a fee. These purchases are typically made within the app and are usually billed to the user's Microsoft account.

So, what's causing this functionality to fail? According to reports, the problem lies with Microsoft's Billing and Store services, which are responsible for processing these transactions. This issue has been going on for a few weeks now, and Microsoft is yet to provide an official statement on the matter.

Meanwhile, users are taking to online forums and social media to voice their frustrations. Some have reported that they are unable to make any in-app purchases, while others say that they are being charged but not receiving the content they paid for.

This issue is not only inconvenient for users, but it's also causing financial losses for developers who rely on in-app purchases as a source of revenue. With users unable to make purchases, these developers are losing out on potential income and are likely to see a dip in app usage as well.

Despite the widespread outcry, Microsoft seems to be taking its time in resolving the issue. This has led to speculation that the company is not taking the problem seriously enough or that they're understaffed to handle the necessary fixes.

If you're one of the many users affected by this issue, there are a few things you can do to try and get some assistance. Firstly, you should contact Microsoft's support team via their website, explaining the issue you're facing and requesting a resolution.

You can also try clearing your cache and cookies, restarting your device or resetting your account information. However, these measures may not always be effective, and if the problem persists, you may have to wait for Microsoft to roll out a fix.

In conclusion, the in-app purchasing issue affecting Windows users is a significant problem that needs to be addressed urgently. Microsoft needs to provide a transparent explanation of what's causing the problem and when they plan to fix it. Users who are affected should take their concerns directly to Microsoft and persist in seeking solutions, even while bearing in mind the possibility that the company may not be able to provide effective assistance immediately.

Users started complaining that they’re unable to perform an in-app purchase in their Windows apps. It looks like the in-app purchase system is currently completely down, because this problem occurred on all Windows platforms, and in all apps.
 
“@GabeAul synchronizations purchases seems broken, I received a lot of mails users complaining their app are locked since today. Plz Fix asap”
 
Users originally blamed developers of certain Windows apps for this problem, but it turned out that it’s not developers’ fault, because the error affects all Windows Store apps. One of the developers reached Twitter, and explained that developers have nothing to do with this issue:
 
“This bug occurs on ALL Windows (phone, 8.1, 10, mobile, etc…) and with ALL apps, so please, don’t blame app developers, it’s not our fault”
 
These complaints are old more than 12 hours, at the time of writing this article, and we still didn’t find any positive feedback that the in-app purchases option is working again. We’re still not sure what’s going on, and Microsoft (again) still didn’t say a word about this issue.
 
But this is a really serious issue, and it even loses profit for both Microsoft and app developers, so we expect the company to come up with the solution as soon as possible.
 
As we said, the inability to perform in-app purchases could do a lot of damage to Microsoft, as the company just started its holiday sale, so users won’t be able to buy anything from the store. Users will also ‘suffer,’ as they favorite app or game deal may expire until the problem with in-app purchases is solved. So, we hope that Microsoft will either come up with the solution quickly, or it will extend the lasting of the current deals for some more time.
