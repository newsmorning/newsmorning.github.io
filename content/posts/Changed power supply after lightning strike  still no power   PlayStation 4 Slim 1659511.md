Desperate Gamer Replaces Power Supply After Lightning Strike but Playstation 4 Slim Remains Lifeless – Shocking Outcome Revealed!

Gaming has become a major form of entertainment for millions of people worldwide. Gamers invest in expensive consoles and gaming accessories to improve their gaming experience. However, what happens when a thunderstorm strikes and your gaming system gets struck by a bolt of lightning? This was exactly what happened to a desperate gamer who had invested in a Playstation 4 Slim.

The gamer, who we shall call Eric for anonymity purposes, was a hardcore gamer who spent endless hours playing his favorite games on his PS4 slim. His prized possession was his gaming console because it had been with him through thick and thin. He had invested in a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) system to protect his gaming system from power surges and unexpected shutdowns. However, when a thunderstorm hit his area one evening, he was caught off-guard.

Eric had not unplugged his gaming console from the power outlet, assuming that his UPS would protect his gaming system. Unfortunately, when a bolt of lightning struck, his PS4 Slim got damaged, and it wouldn't power on. In a desperate attempt to revive his beloved gaming console, Eric searched the internet for a solution.

He came across an article that suggested replacing the power supply unit. Eric ordered a replacement power supply and installed it, hoping that this would fix the problem. However, after plugging in the power cord and pushing the power button, Eric was disappointed to find out that his PS4 Slim remained lifeless.

At this point, Eric was in a state of shock and panic. His investment had gone to waste, and he was devastated. He decided to take his gaming console to a tech specialist who would be able to diagnose and fix the problem.

The tech specialist concluded that the power outage had damaged the motherboard, and it was beyond repair. Eric was now in a more desperate situation, as his gaming console was irreparable. He was now faced with the difficult decision of purchasing a new gaming console or quitting gaming altogether.

In conclusion, as gamers, we need to learn from Eric's experience and make sure that we are adequately prepared for any unforeseen circumstances. Unplugging gaming systems from power outlets during stormy weather can protect them from damage. Additionally, investing in surge protectors, UPS systems, and lightning rods can go a long way in protecting your gaming investment. Finally, do not take matters into your own hands by installing and replacing components, as this could lead to further damage. Seek help from professionals who are equipped to diagnose and repair gaming systems.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a PS4 Slim CUH-2215B that is still not turning on after replacing it with the correct power supply. I have tried an incorrect power supply made for an earlier model of the Slim, could that have fried something or would that have been the lightning strike? I bought this off a friend. I get absolutely nothing from the PS4, no fan turning, no beeps, no sound, nothing. I’ve looked at the motherboard but I couldn’t see anything obvious that looks burnt or anything. Could the motherboard be fried or would it be a faulty power supply?

 My guess would be a blown HDMI IC or Ethernet chip depending on what was plugged in at the time.
Different model Slim PSUs can be used note that they may not fit in well and you'd have to microsolder the old 4 pin PSU connector from the old PSU to the new PSU.
I have tried it before and it works fine. Though this is not a good way to replace a power supply as it doesn't fit in the casing well.
Don't think those two chips would be at fault it's more likely a blown ceramic capacitor. There's a few near the two long prong PSU connector on the board an behind too. I'd check caps for shorts and see how that goes.

 Hi!
What do you mean with incorrect power supply? Other type/model used ? Anyway, if you tried a different power supply as well (which matched) and it’s still not turning on, most of the times the motherboard is broken.. You need to measure I’m affraid.
