Title: You Won't Believe These 9 Genius Hacks to Unblock Your Onedrive Upload in Windows!

If you're using Windows, you're probably familiar with Onedrive, Microsoft's cloud storage service. Onedrive is an essential tool that allows you to store, share, and access your files from any device. However, sometimes you might encounter issues when trying to upload files to Onedrive. In this article, we've put together nine genius hacks to unblock your Onedrive upload in Windows.

1. Check Your Internet Connection

Before you start troubleshooting, make sure that you have a stable and reliable internet connection. Slow or intermittent connections can cause issues with Onedrive uploads. You can test your connection by visiting a speed test website like Fast.com or Speedtest.net.

2. Restart Onedrive

If you're experiencing Onedrive upload issues, the first step is to restart the service. You can do this by right-clicking on the Onedrive icon in the system tray and selecting "Close Onedrive." After a few seconds, restart the Onedrive app from the Start menu or the taskbar.

3. Check for Updates

Microsoft continually releases bug fixes and updates to Onedrive. Check for any available updates by opening the app and clicking on the Help & Settings tab. Click on "Update Onedrive" to check for and install any available updates.

4. Turn Off Antivirus Software

Sometimes, antivirus software can block Onedrive uploads. Disable your antivirus software temporarily and try uploading the files again. If the issue persists, add Onedrive to the list of trusted applications in your antivirus software settings.

5. Remove and Add Account

If you're still having trouble uploading your files, try removing your account from Onedrive and adding it back again. To do this, open the Onedrive app and click on Help & Settings, then select "Account" and "Unlink this PC." Once you've unlinked your account, sign back in to Onedrive and try uploading your files again.

6. Clear Cache and Cookies

Clearing the cache and cookies in your web browser can help unblock Onedrive uploads. Open your web browser, click on the three vertical dots in the top right corner, and select "Settings." Under "Privacy and security," click on "Clear browsing data" and select "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files." Click on "Clear data" to clear your browser's cache.

7. Check Onedrive Storage Limit

Onedrive offers 5GB of free storage, but you may have exceeded that limit. Check how much storage you have used by opening the Onedrive app and clicking on the Help & Settings tab. Click on "Storage." If you have exceeded the storage limit, upgrade your Onedrive account to get more storage.

8. Change Upload Settings

Changing Onedrive's upload settings can get your upload back on track. Open the Onedrive app and click on Help & Settings, then select "Settings." Click on the "Files On-Demand" tab and turn on "Save space and download files as you use them." This feature will prevent the Onedrive app from trying to upload all your files at once.

9. Get in Touch with Microsoft Support

If none of the above solutions work, contact Microsoft Support. Visit the Microsoft Support website and select the "Get Help" button. You can chat with a support agent or schedule a call back to get more detailed help with your Onedrive upload issue.

Microsoft Office applications can automatically save files to your OneDrive cloud account. However, problems with your OneDrive account or OneDrive’s synchronization settings will trigger “Upload Blocked” errors in Office applications.

 
This tutorial covers possible solutions for OneDrive Upload Blocked errors in Office apps on Windows computers. The troubleshooting solutions below apply to all Office applications—Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook, etc.

 
## 1. Reconnect Your OneDrive Account

 
Microsoft reckons reconnecting your Microsoft account to the Office application will fix OneDrive sync errors. Connect your computer to the internet, open the affected Office application, and follow the steps below.

 

 
- Open the File tab in the Office app.

 
- Select Office Account on the sidebar and select Remove next to the active OneDrive or user account.

 
- Select Yes on the pop-up window.

 
- Open the Add a service drop-down menu to reconnect your OneDrive account to the app.

 
- Select Storage and then OneDrive. Select OneDrive for Business if you use a “Microsoft 365 for Business” account.

 
Enter your Microsoft account email and password to proceed. Try saving the document to OneDrive again and check if reconnecting your account resolves the “Upload Blocked” error.

 
## 2. Resume OneDrive Synchronization

 
Pausing OneDrive’s synchronization can cause Microsoft Office applications to throw the “Upload Blocked” error. Check OneDrive’s settings and ensure your computer is syncing files to the cloud storage.

 
- Right-click the OneDrive icon on the Taskbar—see the bottom-right corner of your PC’s screen. OneDrive synchronization is disabled if there’s a “Your files are not currently syncing” message on the screen.
 - Select the gear icon and select Resume syncing to re-enable OneDrive’s synchronization.

 
Try saving the document again when OneDrive displays the “Your files are synced” message.

 
## 3. Verify OneDrive’s Storage Availability

 
Office applications won’t save or synchronize documents to OneDrive if you exhaust your storage quota. If the “Upload Blocked” error persists, check that you haven’t used up your OneDrive storage.

 
- Open the OneDrive menu on the Taskbar, select the gear icon, and select Settings.

 
- Head to the Account tab and check how much free OneDrive storage is linked to your account. Select Get more storage to upgrade your Microsoft 365 account for more OneDrive storage space.

 
## 4. Delete the Office App’s Cache Files

 
Corrupt cache files in Office apps can block document upload to OneDrive. Deleting files in the cache system of the affected Office application may fix the “Upload Blocked” error.

 
- Open the Office app’s File menu, select More on the sidebar and select Options.

 
- Open the Save tab, scroll to the “Cache Settings” section, and select the Delete cached files button.

 
- Select Delete Cached Files on the pop-up window and select OK to save the changes.

 
## 5. Reopen the Office App

 
Force close the Office application if the “Upload Blocked” error persists after reconnecting your OneDrive account. If you haven’t saved the document locally (on your computer), we recommend pasting the content elsewhere as a backup. Say you’re working in Microsoft Word; copy and paste the content of the Word document to Google Docs.

 
Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open the Windows Task Manager. Select or right-click the Office application and select End task.

 
Reopen the app and check if it syncs changes made to your document to OneDrive.

 
## 6. Update the Office Application

 
Office updates ship with new features, security patches, bug fixes, and other improvements. Microsoft rolls out frequent updates to Office applications and automatically installs updates on your device.

 
The “Upload Blocked” error could be because you’re using an old or outdated version of the Office app. Configure your Office apps to update automatically, or manually check for new updates. Connect your computer to the internet and follow the steps below to update Office to the latest version.

 
Open the affected Office application and open the Account tab in the file menu. Expand the Update Options menu and select Update Now.

 
Select Enable updates if “Updates Now” is missing in the update menu.

 
## 7. Disable Office Upload Cache System

 
In Windows, OneDrive co-synchronizes files in Office applications. The integration has some benefits—it allows you to co-edit and work on shared documents with other people. However, you may get the “Upload Blocked” error message if OneDrive and Office upload cache systems are interfering.

 
Turning off the Office upload in OneDrive’s settings may resolve the “Upload Blocked” error.

 
- Select the white or blue OneDrive (cloud) icon on the Taskbar’s notification area. If the icon is missing in the notification area, expand the Show hidden icons menu and select the OneDrive icon.

 
- Select the gear icon in the top-right corner of the OneDrive menu and select Settings.

 
- Head to the Office tab and uncheck Use Office applications to sync Office files that I open. Select OK to save the changes.

 
## 8. Repair Office

 
Repair the Microsoft Office application if none of the troubleshooting fixes above resolve the “Upload Blocked” error.

 
- Press Windows key + X and select Install apps (or Apps and Features in Windows 10) on the Quick Access menu.

 
- Select the menu icon next to the affected Office app and select Modify.

 
- Select either Quick Repair or Online Repair and select the Repair button.

 
“Quick Repair” is a faster repair option that only detects and fixes corrupt files causing the Office app to malfunction. “Online Repair,” on the other hand, provides comprehensive repair and fixes every likely problem. Note that “Online Repair” requires an internet connection.

 
Microsoft recommends running an “Online Repair” only if a “Quick Repair” doesn’t resolve the problem you’re trying to fix.

 
- Select Repair on the confirmation prompt to start the operation.

 
- If any Office app is open, you’ll get a prompt to close the app. Save your document in the app before you proceed. Select Continue to grant the repair tool permission to close the app.

 
The tool will repair all Office programs and features on your computer.

 
- Close the tool and reboot your computer when the repair operation is complete.

 
## 9. Update Windows

 
OneDrive-specific bugs in the Windows operating system can prevent Office apps from uploading documents to the cloud storage platform.

 
Go to Settings > Windows Update and select Check for updates or Restart now.

 
In Windows 10, head to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Updates and install any update available for your computer.

 
## Reinstall Office

 
Contact Microsoft Support or uninstall and reinstall the Office application if the error persists after trying these fixes.
