We purchased the Logitech G Pro X so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

Ever since we were ordered to shelter in place, I’ve had a lot more time to catch up on the latest PC game releases. One of the games I’ve been playing, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, relies on surround sound audio quality to ensure a truly haunting, immersive experience. This is where Logitech’s gaming headset line excels—in particular, with the G Pro X Gaming Headset. 

 

Boasting both memory foam leatherette and velour earpads, and an aluminum frame, it’s well-built and comfortable. What surprised me wasn’t the comfort, however, it was the audio and voice quality. Read on for thoughts on performance, audio quality, and ultimately, the verdict.

 

 

 
##   Design: Practical for gamers   
 

When I pulled the headset out of the box, I was surprised by how simple it appeared. On the side of the earpieces, is a shiny, silver G, signifying the Pro-G Drivers. Otherwise, the headset is all black. Cords trail up from the earpieces and vanish into the padded aluminum headband, ensuring that for those of us with long hair, the cords won’t get tangled up in our gorgeous locks. If you want a colorful gaming headset, you’ll have to find another option.

 

The G Pro X also comes with a plethora of connectivity options, ranging from simple 3.5mm plug-ins for smartphone or gaming PC use, and an external USB sound card to enhance both sound and voice quality. If you’re out of USB space for your computer, then you still have the option of using the 3.5mm plug-ins.

 

My personal favorite part about this design, however, is the detachable 6mm microphone. My cat is a notorious chewer of all things hard and plastic, and my last headset’s microphone bears the marks of her strange habit. The Pro X’s detachable mic means I can stow away the mic in a desk drawer to protect it. This is a great feature, especially knowing that the mic itself is encased in foam for optimal voice chat.

 

One issue did stand: the ear pads. They are a total pain to swap out and don’t like to go into the headset. If you can solely use the leatherette pads, I strongly recommend not touching the other set Logitech provides. It’s simply too hard to swap them out.

 
##   Setup Process: Find the right plug-in  
 
##   Performance: Great for general performance  
 

As I said before, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice requires a higher quality headset to ensure a solid surround sound experience. The Pro X handled the surround sound experience perfectly thanks to a combination of DT Headphone:X 2.0 surround sound and 50mm Pro-G drivers. These two features make it so that you receive positional audio in your gaming experience, which is vital for games such as Hellblade that rely on high-quality audio to let gameplay shine. 

 
The G Pro X also comes with a plethora of connectivity options, ranging from simple 3.5mm plug-ins for smartphone or gaming PC use, and an external USB sound card to enhance both sound and voice quality. 
 

Another perk—the leatherette pads are passive noise-canceling. As I sit and listen to some music on the G Pro X headset, the waterfall cascading from my betta fish tank three feet away is dampened significantly. This is even better for survival sandbox games like 7 Days to Die, where one false mishear can cost you your life.

 

Logitech opted for a simple design in favor of investing in quality specs, and that choice is definitely noticeable. Both the audio jack and the USB external sound card work on PC, but the USB sound card takes audio to another level. The sound comes out clearer and really puts those drivers and that sweet surround sound to work. For those who prefer to really hear the bass in their music, it shined in 21 Pilot’s “Level of Concern.”

Blue Voice technology coupled with the USB sound card also gave me a crystal clear voice during gameplay. During Far Cry 5 and Destiny 2 gaming sessions, my boyfriend could hear my voice in Discord without any background noise. Better yet, it came through without any lag, fulfilling the real-time voice communication promise Logitech boasts. For dedicated gamers, this can make the difference beating opponents in arena-style games where team communication is vital.

 
##   Comfort: Comfortable  
 

The Logitech G Pro X’s leatherette ear pads and padded headband lightly pressed on my head, but not so much that it was uncomfortable. The fit is firm enough to ensure they remain on your head and the leatherette passive noise-canceling pads can perform to the best of their ability. They’re also easily adjustable in case you prefer a tighter or looser fit depending on your gaming mood. 

 
##   Price: On the higher end   
 

The $130 Logitech G Pro X is more expensive than many wired gaming headsets, but it’s reasonably priced for what it offers. If you want extra frills like wireless connectivity, high-end audio codecs, RGB, and active noise cancellation, you’ll end up paying twice as much.

##   Logitech G X Pro vs. Sennheiser Game ONE  
 

However, one of the big issues with the Game ONE headset is that some people found it to be slightly uncomfortable. If you’re looking for some great comfort during your gaming experience, then you might want to consider the Logitech G X Pro. If you would prefer a fun design at the risk of ear comfort, then the Sennheiser would be better suited to your needs.
