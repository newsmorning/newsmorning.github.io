Has your Gopro Hero 4 Silver suddenly refused to turn on? You are not alone! This is a common problem experienced by Gopro camera users, and it can be quite frustrating, especially when you are ready to capture amazing moments.

Luckily, there are several possible reasons why your Gopro Hero 4 Silver is not turning on. Below are some of the reasons and solutions to enable you to get your camera working again.

## Low Battery

One of the most common reasons why your Gopro Hero 4 Silver camera refuses to turn on is a low battery. The battery may have drained out completely without you realizing it, or the battery may be damaged and unable to hold a charge.

To check and ensure that the battery is charged to full capacity, remove the battery from the camera and connect it to a charger. Leave it to charge for a while and then reinsert it into the camera. If the battery was low, the camera should turn on now, and you can start capturing those special moments you were waiting for.

## Power Button Issues

Another possible reason why your Gopro Hero 4 Silver camera is not turning on is an issue with its power button. If the power button is defective or loose, it will not function correctly, and the camera will not turn on.

To solve this problem, try removing the battery and the SD card from the camera and reinserting them. If this does not work, check if the power button is loose or stuck. If it is, take it to a technician to have it checked and fixed.

## Firmware Issues

If your Gopro Hero 4 Silver camera refuses to turn on even with a fully charged battery, it could be a firmware issue. A glitch in the old software could be causing the camera to malfunction.

To fix this, you will need to update the firmware. Connect your camera to your computer using a USB cable, and then go to the Gopro website to download the latest firmware update. After downloading, follow the instructions for installation to update the software.

## Camera Overheating

Some Gopro cameras, including the Gopro Hero 4 Silver, can overheat and shut down if used for an extended period, particularly when shooting high-resolution videos.

To prevent overheating, avoid exposing your camera to direct sunlight, and only use it for short periods followed by breaks. Also, clean the camera regularly, particularly the vents and the lens to prevent dust buildup that can cause overheating.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, your Gopro Hero 4 Silver refusing to turn on is a common issue with simple solutions. Ensure that you check the battery, the power button, the firmware, and potential overheating issues to get your camera up and running in no time. If all these solutions do not work, take the camera to a technician for further examination and fixing. Happy shooting!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello. I have charges my batteries and when I put them in my GoPro wonâ€™t come on. It was working one day and the next it just stopped. If by some chance it comes on as soon as I move it, it stops working. Any ideas?

 Patti Douglas, this could be caused by a bad battery or battery connectors. I suggest you use this guide GoPro Hero Battery Replacement and take a good look at the wiring/battery. Post some good images of what you find so we can see what you see. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that.
