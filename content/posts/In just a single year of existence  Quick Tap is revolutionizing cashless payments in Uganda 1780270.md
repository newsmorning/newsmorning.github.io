Title: From Cash-Only to Cashless: How Quick Tap is Transforming Uganda's Payment Landscape in Just One Year!

Introduction:
Uganda is a country that is rapidly progressing towards a cashless economy. The latest innovation that has caught the attention of citizens, tourists, and other businesses in Uganda is the "Quick Tap payment system." Within just one year after its launch, Quick Tap has transformed the payment landscape in Uganda, and more and more people are moving away from cash payments. In this article, we will explore how Quick Tap is revolutionizing payment systems in Uganda.

Body:
Quick Tap is a payment system that enables people to make transactions electronically via mobile phones. With this system, users can send and receive money, pay bills, and purchase goods and services without the need to carry cash. All that is needed is a mobile phone with internet connectivity, and the Quick Tap app.

One of the key benefits of Quick Tap is that it provides a fast and convenient way to pay for goods and services. Instead of spending time withdrawing cash from an ATM or bank, Quick Tap allows you to access your money directly from your mobile phone. This means that you can easily pay whenever you need to, without having to worry about carrying cash with you.

Another advantage of the Quick Tap payment system is that it promotes fiscal responsibility. Since the system is electronic, it enables people to track their spending more easily, which in turn helps them to budget their money better. Quick Tap also helps to reduce fraud and theft as all transactions are recorded and can be traced back to the user.

Businesses in Uganda have also benefited from the adoption of Quick Tap. Many businesses have already adopted the system, which has led to increased efficiency and cost savings in terms of cash handling. The use of Quick Tap also enables businesses to better manage their cash flow and avoid the costs associated with accepting cash payments.

As more people in Uganda become aware of the benefits of Quick Tap, the payment landscape is changing rapidly. According to the latest statistics, there has been a significant increase in the number of people using Quick Tap. In just one year, the number of Quick Tap transactions has increased from 14,000 to over a million, with the total value of transactions increasing from UGX 650 million to UGX 54 billion.

Conclusion:
The adoption of Quick Tap in Uganda has led to significant changes in the payment landscape. With its many benefits, Quick Tap is rapidly becoming the payment system of choice for millions of Ugandans. As more businesses and individuals adopt this system, we can expect to see a more efficient, secure, and convenient payment system emerge in Uganda. In just one year, Quick Tap has shown that change is possible and that the move towards a cashless economy is underway.

It is not so often that a start-up company comes in to challenge a technology that is yet to garner popularity, in a developing country at that. Quick Tap is turning the tables all around with a brave motive of becoming a leading provider of cashless payment solutions in Uganda.
 
As we strive to create a cashless society, Quick Tap does employ Near Field Communication (NFC) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies to deliver secure, easy, fast and efficient payments and access control services. These technologies are an emerging solution to making payment for goods and services using cash, in a much secure and convenient way.
 
Quick Tap is primarily focused on four main sectors; public transport, live events (musical and sporting), parking and live stock management. They install NFC tap to pay terminals at the client premises which users with NFC devices such as phones, cards, wristbands, and stickers can tap to make payment or access premises.
 
Why cashless payments? 
Awed by the lack of solutions to the problems we all face on a daily, Quicktap sought to harness a simple, powerful and yet readily available technology in the form of NFC and RFID. The application of these technologies is far reaching and that is a reason for their motto “Endless Possibilities”.
 
Who are the customers? 
The nature of the technology gives Quick Tap the flexibility to have customers ranging from events goers to a multinational company looking to track stock in warehouses. They therefore do not have a well defined target market per se. Quick Tap looks to partner up with businesses in different sectors such as the transportation sector, offering hardware and software installation and normally charging a commission of the fees charged to the end user.
 
How is business conducted? 
The company operates across all industries based on 3 models namely; Cashless Payments, Access Control and Ticketing .
Quick Tap is barely one year old but have done a couple of events and partners ranging from Blankets and Wine to Pioneer Easy Bus to Uganda Coupon Book. There is also an upcoming cashless event in the Bora Bora Fest 17 on October 8th, and Quick Tap is fully associated.
 
The Challenges faced
Being a Start-Up, Quick Tap has faced the challenge of acceptability on the market owing to the type and cost of technology dealt in. The technology dealt with is yet to be accommodated by the majority public and not everyone is comfortable with cash off themselves.
 
There is also stiff competition from already established companies that have a low cost of production.
