Fortunately, with the iPhone 6S and its intuitive operating system, changing your shipping address is easier than ever before. 

First, open the "Settings" app on your iPhone 6S. Scroll down until you see "General" and tap on it. Next, select "About" and scroll down again until you see "Shipping Address." If you haven't yet entered a shipping address, now is the time to do so. Simply tap on "Add Shipping Address" and enter your information.
