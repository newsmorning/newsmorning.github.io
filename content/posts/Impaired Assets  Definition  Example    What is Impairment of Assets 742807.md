# You Won't Believe What Impaired Assets Mean And How It Can Affect Your Business - Shocking Examples Revealed!


Have you ever heard of impaired assets? If you're a business owner or an accountant, then you know what it means. But for those who don't know, impaired assets refer to assets that have lost their value over time or have no market value. Impairment can happen due to a variety of factors, including economic changes, obsolescence, or incidents like natural disasters. The impact that impaired assets can have on your business can be quite significant. In this article, we will explore what impaired assets mean and how they can affect your business with shocking examples.


## What are Impaired Assets?

Impaired assets are defined as assets that have seen a significant decline in value or no longer have any market value. These assets are classified as "impaired" when their carrying value or book value is more than their recoverable value. Carrying value is the cost of the asset minus depreciation, while the recoverable value is the amount of cash that the asset can generate if it is sold. When the carrying value is higher than the recoverable value, it means that the asset is impaired.

## How Can Impaired Assets Affect Your Business?

Impaired assets can signal a significant problem for your business. They can impact your financial statements and affect your business's cash flow, profitability, and investor confidence. Here are some ways that impaired assets can hurt your business:

1. Reduced profitability: When an asset's carrying value is higher than its recoverable value, it leads to a lower profit margin. This is because the asset isn't generating enough money to cover the cost of its purchase.

2. Cash flow problems: If you have many impaired assets on your balance sheet, it can lead to cash flow problems. You might have to spend money to maintain the assets when they aren't generating any income.

3. Reduced investor confidence: Impaired assets can be a sign of poor management, and this can impact investor confidence. Investors might be hesitant to invest in your business if they see a significant number of impaired assets on your balance sheet.

## Shocking Examples of Impaired Assets

Here are some real-life examples of impaired assets that had a significant impact on businesses:

1. Sears Holdings - In 2018, Sears filed for bankruptcy and listed impaired assets worth $2.2 billion. These assets included inventory, real estate, and intellectual property.

2. General Electric - In 2018, General Electric announced that it had $22 billion of impaired assets, mainly from its power business.

3. Carillion - In 2018, the UK construction company Carillion went bankrupt, and it listed impaired assets worth £925 million. These assets included goodwill, contracts, and receivables.

## How to Deal with Impaired Assets

It's essential to have a plan in place to deal with impaired assets. Here are some steps that you can take:

1. Assess the impairment: The first step is to assess the impairment correctly. You will need to determine the cause and how much the asset's value has declined.

2. Write down the asset: If the asset's carrying value is higher than its recoverable value, you will need to write it down. This means reducing the asset's value on your balance sheet.

3. Dispose of the asset: If the asset is no longer useful, it's best to sell it or dispose of it.

4. Focus on asset management: To avoid impaired assets, you should focus on asset management. This includes tracking the asset's value over time and ensuring that it remains useful and profitable.

## Conclusion

Impaired assets are more common than you might think, and they can have a significant impact on your business. It's crucial to assess, write down, and dispose of these assets to limit their impact on your financial statements. You should also focus on asset management to avoid future impairments. Understanding the concept of impaired assets is crucial for any business owner or accountant.

Fell by around 38 % because of some changes made by the management in the company’s working and due to the competitor’s entrance in the same line of business with the cheaper substitute. As a result, the fair market value of company B ltd fell to the level of $ 12 million from the $ 15 million when the acquisition was made. Analyze the impact of the impairment.
 
Solution
 
Company A ltd purchased company B ltd and paid $ 19 million as the purchase price for buying company B ltd. When the book value of the assets of Company B was $ 15 million, The extra amount of $ 4 million ($19 – $15 million) paid by the company A ltd above the book value of the assets of the Company B is to be recorded as the goodwill on the assets side of the company ‘s balance sheet. Over the year after the acquisition was made, the sales of Company B ltd.

So, after a year, Company A ltd. will compare the fair value of its subsidiary companySubsidiary CompanyA subsidiary company is controlled by another company, better known as a parent or holding company.

In case the fair value of B ltd. is less than its carrying valueCarrying ValueCarrying value is the book value of assets in a company's balance sheet, computed as the original cost less accumulated depreciation/impairments.

In the present case, after a year of the company’s fair market value, B ltd falls to the level of $ 12 million from the $ 15 million. Now, this fair market value of the B ltd, along with the goodwill, will be compared with the actual value recorded in the books of accounts, and with the differential amount, goodwill will be reduced.
 
Current Fair market value + Goodwill  = $ 12 million + $ 4million = $16 million
 
This $ 16 million will be compared with the initial purchase price paid ($19 million), and the difference will be impairment of the goodwill.
 
Impairment =$19 million – $16 million =$3 million
 
This amount will be reduced from the Goodwill amount present in the books of accounts
 
=Goodwill initially recorded – $3 million = $ 4 million – $ 3 million = $ 1 million
 
Thus the goodwill, in this case, is the impaired assets, and on the balance sheet, the amount of new goodwill to be shown will be $ 1 million.
