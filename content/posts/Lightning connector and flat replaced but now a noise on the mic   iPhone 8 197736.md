If you're an iPhone 8 user, you might want to listen up. Recent reports have indicated that the latest Lightning Connector and Flat Fixes can result in mic failures on your phone. This is a serious issue for anyone who relies on their iPhone for communication, and it's important to know whether or not your device is affected.

First, let's discuss what the Lightning Connector and Flat Fixes are. The Lightning Connector is the port on your iPhone that you use to charge your device, as well as connect it to other devices or headphones. The Flat Fixes are the small, flat components inside the port that help to stabilize the connection between the port and the cable. These components are designed to be resilient, but recent reports indicate that they may be prone to failure on some iPhone 8 models.

The issue with these components is that when they fail, they can cause the mic on your iPhone to stop working. This means that you won't be able to make phone calls, use Siri, or record audio with your device. This can be a major problem for anyone who relies on their iPhone for communication or work-related tasks.

So, how do you know if your iPhone 8 is affected? The easiest way to check is to make a phone call and see if the other person can hear you. If they can't, there's a chance that your mic has failed due to a Lightning Connector or Flat Fix issue. You can also try recording audio or using Siri to see if those functions are working properly.

If you suspect that your iPhone 8 is affected by this issue, your best course of action is to contact Apple Support. They can help you troubleshoot the problem and determine if a repair or replacement is necessary. In some cases, Apple may offer a free repair for affected devices.

It's important to note that not all iPhone 8 models are affected by this issue. However, if you've noticed any problems with your mic, it's worth checking to see if your device is one of the models that may be prone to failure.

In conclusion, if you're an iPhone 8 user, it's important to be aware of the latest Lightning Connector and Flat Fixes issue that can result in mic failures. Check your device to see if you're experiencing any issues with your mic, and contact Apple Support if you need assistance. Don't let this issue go unnoticed, as it can have a major impact on your ability to communicate and work effectively with your device.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi all. A store replaced my lightning connector+flat from my iPhone cause the original stopped to charge. After this all recorded sounds on whatsapp, voice memos, facebook and phone calls using the regular cell phone and whatsapp audio are generating a noise on the background of the audio. Using the headphone/mic from Apple nothing is recorded. Recording videos using the front and rear camera, the noise is not recording. Only on what I described.You can hear the noise on a voice memo on a YouTube video that I did. The first audio is the original recorded. The second on the video I just amplified for better hearing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTMM3haK...Any idea of the problem? Thanks.
Update (10/13/2022)
@strongbow I tried to clean the grills, but I think the correct possibility is the "1". Cause I can try to use the iphone near from my face, on the normal position, without touch the sensor with the screen on and the sound is horrible. The answering machine here when I call to test turn off due the sound so low.
The audio message created on the whatsapp before the replacement has a good waveform but after the replacement is horrible.  Here is the screenshot.

 Take it  back, not sure what you mean by flat but if it was all working before it's up to them to fix their mistakes.

 Have to agree with @strongbow, the replacement lightning connector they put on appears to have one or more bad microphone(s) on it. You've got three microphones in your iPhone 8; two lower ones on the charging flex and an upper one on the flash/button assembly.
The lower ones are used for phone calls and apparently whatsapp, facebook (do you mean facetime?) and voice memos, while videos you record use the upper microphone. So yeah one of the mics on the replacement flex is bad. You'll need to take it back and have them replace it.

Well, we haven't had much luck in making progress after you got the first bad lighting connector replaced. If this was my phone, I would think its time I opened it up and checked the repair shop's work, specifically looking at the two microphones on the lightning connector, as marked in the photo below.

I'd suggest following the lightning connector assembly replacement guide up to Step 32, then skip the logic board removal part and jump to Step 52 and 52 to take out the speaker.

At this point both microphones are accessible and you can check them for being in the proper position and possibly peel them back to make sure the vents are clear and the grills aren't clogged; you should be able to see a bright light through them.

 @dadibrokeit @strongbow the lightning was replaced for a new one and now I have this:
Voice memos, Whatsapp/Messenger/Instagram audio voice messages are working. The problem now is only during the phone calls. If using the cell to call to someone, not using whatsapp call I mean the cell phone, my voice is very very low and fails sometimes. I did a test doing a call to my phone home and used the answering machine and the voice recorded sucks.So I did a test. During the phone call if I turn the speaker on, my voice goes perfect. The voice recorded on the answering was clear. I did a phone call to and everyone listened me.So, what is the problem now? Maybe a random bug the Apple create for 3rd party replacements connectors? Thanks
