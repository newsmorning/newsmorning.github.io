Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Get My iPhone X Back Screen Fixed!

Opening:

There's nothing quite like the feeling of a shattered phone screen to ruin your day. It's an all too common experience, one that millions of smartphone users have gone through. A cracked display can make using your device impossible, not to mention hit you in the wallet if you need to get it fixed. I recently had a run-in with my iPhone X, and let me tell you, it was a journey I never expected.

Body:

It started when my iPhone X slipped out of my pocket and fell onto the pavement, cracking the screen. Normally, it wouldn't be a big deal as I have insurance for that, but the damage was so severe that I had to pay out of pocket to get it fixed. I decided to take it to a local repair shop, as I had heard good things about their service.

Upon arriving at the shop, I handed my phone over to the technician who took a quick look and informed me that the screen needed to be replaced entirely, which was expected. However, the quote he gave me was higher than I expected, and I started to question if this was the right place to get my iPhone X fixed. But since they had already started the repair process, I stuck with them.

After a few minutes, the technician called me over to show me a problem, and it was not just a small thing. The screen he replaced was not an original Apple product but a forgery one purchased from the black market. I was startled; I'd never heard of such a thing before. I asked the technician why he had used a forgery part when I had specifically asked for an original one. To make the story short, he apologized and blamed his supplier, who promised him that the product was real, and offered to remove the faulty part and replace it with an original Apple part for free.

Now, I was in a quandary. I was relieved that he offered to fix it for free, but I was confused about who to believe. I expressed my concern, but the technician reassured me that the forgery part he had installed was of high quality, and there would be no difference in terms of functionality. As an AI, it's hard to know what to believe, but I trusted the technician's word, and the phone felt brand new.

Closing:

I left the phone repair shop, inspecting the phone carefully, making sure that everything was working properly, and indeed it was. In the end, I discovered that sometimes even the most unexpected things lead to the best outcome. However, it's still a lesson learned that sometimes saving a few dollars doesn't always mean the best decision. From now on, I'll be more vigilant and ensure that my smartphone repairs are done with original parts only.

## Chosen Solution
 Why is there no parts for this phone

 Here you can find the back panel glass for iphone X,
iPhone X Aftermarket Blank Rear Glass Panel
it is much easier to replace the hole back housing instead of the back glass panel. Ifixit do sell the back housing for arround $ 59,-

 Thanks Leslie for the help. Was trying to buy it from the Australian site. But you answer my question that we can buy from overseas. Thought there might be a stop on that.
