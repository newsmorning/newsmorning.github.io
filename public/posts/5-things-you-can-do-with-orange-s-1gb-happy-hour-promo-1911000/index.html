Are you an Orange S subscriber looking for ways to maximize your data usage? Look no further than the 1GB Happy Hour promo, which can be used for one hour every day. Here are five game-changing tricks that will help you get the most out of this offer.\n1. Set reminders for happy hour The 1GB Happy Hour promo is only available for one hour every day. Make sure you don’t miss out by setting reminders on your phone or using calendar apps such as Google Calendar to receive notifications when happy hour is about to start.\n2. Download offline content during happy hour To make the most of your data allocation, take advantage of happy hour by downloading offline content. For example, you can download Netflix or Spotify shows so you can watch or listen to them when you’re offline. This way, you can save your data allocation for other activities such as browsing the web or checking social media.\n3. Use data compression on websites Did you know that some websites have data compression settings that will reduce your data usage? Enable data compression settings in your browser, and your data usage will go down. This means that you can enjoy browsing your favorite websites without worrying about your data allocation running out.\n4. Stream videos in standard definition Video streaming is known to be a data-heavy activity. However, you can still enjoy streaming videos while taking advantage of the 1GB Happy Hour promo. Make sure to stream in standard definition instead of high definition, which requires more data. This way, you can still keep up with the latest videos without using up all your data.\n5. Use Wi-Fi networks Last but not least, make use of Wi-Fi networks whenever you can. When you’re at home or in a public place such as a café, connect to the Wi-Fi network to avoid using your mobile data allocation. This way, you can conserve your data usage for when you need it the most.\nIn conclusion, the 1GB Happy Hour promo is a great way for Orange S subscribers to maximize their data usage. By following the above tips, you can make the most of this offer, while ensuring that you do not run out of data. With the right strategy, you can enjoy streaming videos, browsing your favorite websites or listening to your favorite music without worrying about your data allocation. Start using these game-changing tricks today!\nInternet has now become one of those things listed on everyone’s budget. Back in the day it was airtime/credit to make a call or text but with smartphones, Calls have been replaced by Skype and Viber, Texts have been replaced with Whatsapp and entertainment has been redefined by smartphones.\nWe can now play music, movies and games on our phones unlike in the past. Even though that’s a positive technological trend, the costs of data still bore holes in many people’s pockets causing many to look for alternative ways of staying online affordably.\nMultiple telecoms are offering promotional data bundles that give you access to affordable data to help you stay online longer and to do those things that make life what it is today. Orange a leading internet provider is making staying online possible with its “Happy Hour” Promotion that gives you 1GB of data for one hour during the day or 6 hours at night. We asked around how people use the service and came up with the top 5 things you can do with 1GB in an hour or in 6 hours at night.\nThe Summary:\nConnect with Friends on Social Media Back up your data to the cloud Streaming online Content Download the latest OS or Music or Movies or Games. Update your computer software/Apps 1. Connect with Friends on Social Media Lets face it. The first thing you would do when you start that browser is check out what your friends are up to on Facebook, Twitter or check out your Instagram or Pinterest feed for some awesome pictures. Social Media has become the standard way to interact with the world and I doubt you are the exception. Many people don’t even realize that they spend a minimum of 500 shillings daily to make sure they have data to chat with their friends on Whatsapp and Viber.\nOne we found really useful is when you have that interview on Skype for a possibly good opportunity. The last thing you want is a bad connection or not having enough data. 1GB with good speeds is definitely enough for you to nail the interview. It might also be that you want to keep in touch with Family in the diaspora making that long Skype call really essential.\n2. Back up your data to the cloud I know you’ve been procrastinating, but here’s your opportunity to backup your data to the cloud before you regret losing important files and photos. You can use services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive by Microsoft, iCloud for the Mac and so many other options out there. Don’t wait. Do it now with 1 GB. Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket — I learnt it the hard way when I was robbed of my laptop and my back up drive. So that hard drive you bought is not enough. Select your most important data and back it up on the cloud. (Don’t Say I didn’t warn you)\n3. Streaming online Content Have you always wanted to watch that tutorial on how to make the perfect presentation, organize your workspace, do awesome photography or make your own robot? or may be it was a “Do It Yourself” (DIY) project on learning how to do your own hair or nail that recipe… Well, here’s your opportunity. You can find a tonne of tutorials on YouTube and a couple more online courses from massive open online course providers such as Edx and coursera.\nYou can also take a break off your busy schedule and watch some comedy from Uganda’s comedians like Anne Kansiime and Pablo on YouTube. Watch inspiring talks like Steve Jobs Stanford Commencement Address or listen to Podcasts of your favorite speakers online. You might be looking for new sounds on Soundcloud, Reverbnation or itunes or just listening to Online Radio. May be you want to catch the trailer to that most anticipated Movie coming soon or maybe an episode of your favorite sitcom or soap that you missed. these are just a few of the things you can do with 1GB.\n4. Download the latest OS or Music or Movies or Games. Here’s your opportunity to update your operating system to the latest version. Mac fan boys can upgrade their Mac OSX to the latest version Mac OSX Mavericks right from the Mac store here.\nWindows guys running Windows 8 can update to Windows 8.1 which comes with a couple of improvements (for instance inclusion of the start menu). All you have to do is make sure your windows automatic updates are turned on. Just make sure you have at least 20% free disk space on your computer. Windows will automatically update your system the next time you restart.\nAs for the Linux fans, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS(code named “Trusty Tahr”) is your choice.\n5. Update your computer software/Apps Yes, time to take the security of your data seriously. Microsoft reported some security flaws on Internet Explorer earlier this month. To be safe, you have to turn on windows updates on your computer which will automatically download security patches for all the Microsoft applications on your computer. You can also update your computer Anti-virus to have the latest anti-virus definitions from your Anti-virus vendor or updates the apps on your smartphone. These updates usually need lots of data with a faster link.\nYes I know they are 6 things and not 5. We just put in an extra one because we can 🙂 That 1GB from Orange costs 5,000 Shillings anytime of the day and 2500 shillings at night between Midnight and 6:00am. to get the 1GB dial *133# and select option and select option 4 or 5 to start enjoying\nImage: CantuBeauty\nRelated ","wordCount":"1380","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Frieda Williams"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-things-you-can-do-with-orange-s-1gb-happy-hour-promo-1911000/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash the Power of Orange S 1GB Happy Hour Promo - 5 Game-Changing Tricks You Can't Afford to Miss!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 31, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1380 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Frieda Williams</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-set-reminders-for-happy-hour>1.
