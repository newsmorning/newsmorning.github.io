You Won't Believe What Happened to this MSI Ge 62 2Qc Apache Charger Port - It's a Shocker!

One of the most common issues that laptop users face is a damaged charger port. The port is a crucial component responsible for powering up the device and keeping it running. A damaged charger port can cause serious issues and render the laptop unusable until it's fixed.

Recently a shocking incident happened with the charger port of an MSI Ge 62 2Qc Apache laptop. The laptop owner, John, was using his laptop when he noticed a faint burning smell. Initially, he thought it was due to the dust accumulated on the fan, but then he noticed something else.

The charger port of the laptop had started melting and smoking, which was causing the burning smell. John immediately turned off the laptop and unplugged the charger from the port. He inspected the port and found that it had suffered considerable damage due to overheating.

The issue was more severe than expected, and John needed expert help to fix it. He took the laptop to a professional technician who diagnosed the problem and found out that the charger port had started to melt due to excess heat generated by the laptop's battery.

The technician explained that the battery had been overcharged, and the excess current had caused the battery to generate more heat than it could dissipate. The heat then got transferred to the charger port, causing it to melt.

The technician fixed the charger port and installed a new battery with a protection circuit, which would prevent it from overcharging. John was surprised to learn that the reason behind the issue was an overcharged battery, which he had no idea about. He was grateful to the technician for fixing his laptop and educating him about the issue.

This incident teaches us an important lesson - that we must take good care of our laptops and avoid overcharging them. Overcharging the battery may seem like a convenient way to keep our laptops running for longer, but it can cause serious damage. It's always important to follow the guidelines provided by the laptop manufacturer on charging and taking care of the battery.

In conclusion, a damaged charger port can cause significant inconvenience and affect our productivity. We must always be careful and take good care of our laptops to avoid such issues. Also, it's best to seek expert help from a professional technician to diagnose and fix any laptop-related issues to avoid any further damage.

## Chosen Solution
 Im very confused whenever it comes to computers and all of their inner workings — i dont even know what kind of laptop that i have beyond the fact that it is a msi gaming one with a rainbow keyboard and dragon logo — but i have very important stuff on my current laptop and I need to at least turn it on one last time so that I can salvage all of my old stuff before switching computers. My charger has always gotten super hot and soon even got the metal part that plugs into the actual port on the computer super bent so that you had to constantly reposition it in order to get it to charge. It often gave huge sparks and burned me, in fact. Recently it stopped charging the computer at all and my computer refuses to even turn on since — even whenever the charger was plugged in — it was always below 20% charge and could die at any moment if the charger got knocked out of place. Ive tried everything to reposition the charger and get it to charge again, but no luck. We have another computer of the exact same model that was used by my sister, however, and I even went as far as attempting to use the charger from THAT one to get my own computer to turn on. Still nothing. The little charger hole on the side of the computer smells completely burnt and wont react to any positioning of the charger or even a completely unbent charger like the one that I got from the other computer. Please, I need to get my stuff at least moved from this computer to the other one. I cant take it to a repair service or anything since i live in the middle of nowhere. Please help!!! I just need to get it turned on again at least one more time!!!

 if xou just want to access your data you might be in luck, since windows (gaming) laptop seldomly have soldered on storage device. You can open up your Laptop and check whether you have a 2.5” Hard drive / SSD with S-ATA Connector or a “stick” type ssd. Once you have identified which you have you could buy an adapter off amazon or a different retailer of your choosing, connect your drive to it, plug it into USB of a different PC/Laptop and you should be able to access all of your data.
