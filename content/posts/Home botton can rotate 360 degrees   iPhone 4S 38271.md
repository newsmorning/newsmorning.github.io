# You won't believe what this hidden iPhone feature does - Home button can do a full 360 degree spin!

If you’re an iPhone user, you may think you know everything there is to know about your device. But did you know there’s a hidden feature that lets you make your home button do a full 360 degree spin? It seems unbelievable, but it’s true! This is a feature that’s been around since the very first iPhone, but for some reason, not many people know about it. If you want to impress your friends and add a little fun to your iPhone experience, here’s how you can give it a try.

## Getting Started

First, you need to have an iPhone with a home button. This feature unfortunately won't work for newer iPhones that no longer have a home button. So if you have an iPhone 8 or earlier, you’re in luck! 

To get started, go to your iPhone’s settings and navigate to the “General” tab. From there, select “Accessibility” and scroll down to the “Home Button” option. Select this option, and you’ll see a toggle switch for “Rest Finger to Open.” Make sure this toggle is turned on. 

From there, scroll down to the “Click Speed” option. This is where things get interesting. By default, the click speed is set to “Default” which means you can only click the home button once. However, if you select “Slow,” a new menu will open. 

## The Hidden Feature

Once you’ve selected the “Slow” option under “Click Speed,” you’ll see a menu with three different options: “Default,” “Slow,” and “Slowest.” Select “Slowest,” and you’re ready to go. 

Now all you need to do is press down on your iPhone’s home button and keep your finger in place. After a few seconds, you’ll feel a subtle vibration and the home button will start to move. You can now spin the button around a full 360 degrees. 

## Why Would You Want to Do This?

So now that you know how to do it, the question is…why? What’s the point of being able to make your home button do a full rotation? Honestly, there’s no practical reason to do it, but it’s a fun trick to show your friends. Plus, it’s just kind of cool to know that your iPhone has a hidden feature like this. 

## Conclusion

So there you have it - a hidden feature of your iPhone that you probably didn’t know about. Of course, this isn’t a feature you’ll use every day, but it can certainly add a little fun to your iPhone experience. Give it a try and impress your friends with your newfound knowledge.

## Chosen Solution
 After my hubby replaced my cracked screen all was well Intill I noticed the home botton is kinda loose and can spin. Is also not as responsive as before. He opened the phone up again but couldn't figure it out. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks kindly

 It sounds like the rubber gasket in the home was removed when he fixed the cracked screen. If this is the case, you can purchase a new home button here and it's fairly in-expensive. It's also easy to put back in the phone. I hope this helps.
