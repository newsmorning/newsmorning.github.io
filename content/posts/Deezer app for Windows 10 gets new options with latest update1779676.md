# Revolutionize Your Music Experience: Deezer App for Windows 10 Unveils Cutting-Edge Features in Latest Update!

Music is an integral part of our lives, and with technology at our fingertips, we are now spoilt for choice when it comes to listening to our favorite tracks. One such platform that has been revolutionizing the music industry is Deezer, a music streaming service that has been gaining significant popularity globally. Deezer has a vast library of over 73 million tracks, and with its latest update, the app has unveiled cutting-edge features for its Windows 10 users that promise to revolutionize their music experience.

Firstly, Deezer's new update comes with an improved user interface that makes the music streaming experience more seamless and intuitive. The app now has customizable themes that allow users to personalize the look and feel of the app based on their preferences. Moreover, the app now features more prominent album art and clearer artist images that provide users with a more immersive experience while listening to their favorite tracks. 

Another exciting feature in the latest update is Deezer's integration with Windows 10's Cortana assistant. This integration allows users to access their music library by voice commands, making it easier for users to search for their favorite tracks, artists or albums. This feature saves time and effort for users who are busy with other tasks and want to navigate through their music library without having to use their hands. 

The latest update also comes with Deezer's unique Songcatcher feature, which allows users to identify songs playing in the background. Users can use this feature to identify songs playing on the radio or at a party, and add them to their Deezer playlists from within the app. This feature is an excellent addition that will certainly save users the hassle of asking around for the name of a song they can't get out of their head.

The new update also comes with Deezer's Flow feature, which is one of the app's most popular features. The Flow feature creates a personal continuous playlist for the user based on their listening history and preferences. With the latest update, users can now access their Flow playlist directly from the home page, providing them with a more natural way to interact with the app. 

In conclusion, the Deezer app for Windows 10 is an excellent music streaming platform that has been revolutionizing the music industry with its innovative features. The latest update comes with a vastly improved user interface, integration with Cortana, the Songcatcher feature, and an accessible Flow feature, all of which promises to enhance the user's music experience. If you're a music lover looking to spice up your music streaming experience, look no further than Deezer's latest update.

Deezer just released a new update for its Deezer Music Preview app for Windows 10 that brings a couple of design and functionality changes to its Premium+ users. However, even after the update, Deezer Music for Windows 10 is still in the Preview phase.
 
The update itself enhances the design of the app with some user interface changes: revamped content pages, a new tab bar, and the ability to store your favorite music under “My Music” section are just some of the many changes.
 
Besides picking your favorite songs on Deezer, you now have the ability to put your favorite Bob Marley songs into a special playlist called “Rasta Legends.” Additionally, the new update lets users adjust audio quality based on the strength of your internet connection. So, if your internet connection is weaker, you can adjust audio quality to low to avoid lag and additional buffering.
 

 
Here’s the complete changelog of the update:
 
- “Put Bob Marley in your ‘Rasta Legends’ playlist with the click of a finger. Simply click the 3 dots on the player, or tap and hold the song you wish to add from an album page.
 - Personalise the audio quality in your app settings. You can adjust your audio settings depending on the internet connection you are using.”

 
## Deezer building its presence on Windows 10
 
Deezer released its new Deezer Music Preview app in March, replacing the old Deezer app which is actually still available in the Store. The reason for the new app is to bring Deezer to all Windows 10 platforms, as the old one was only limited to PCs. In that manner, the latest update is also available on both Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile.

The new update brought some interesting changes, but there’s still no word about Cortana integration. This is actually unusual, as Deezer is a popular service and almost every newer Windows 10 app now comes with support for Microsoft’s assistant. We hope that Deezer will finally introduce Cortana integration with some of the coming updates. Until then, you can enjoy other benefits of the app.
 
Deezer is one of the most popular music subscription services in the world. It offers more than 50 million songs on your Windows 10 device (and other platforms). However, just like all subscription services, using Deezer comes with a price: €6.99/month for Deezer Premium Plus. (If you want to subscribe to Deezer Premium Plus, go to this link.)
 
On the other hand, if you don’t want to pay for listening to music on your Windows 10 or Windows 10 Mobile device, you can use some other newly released Windows 10 radio apps. The Windows 10 Store now offers the best online radio services in the world, like TuneIn, Pandora, or Audials.
 
To download the latest update, just go to the Store, and check for updates. Or if you don’t use Deezer Music Preview for Windows 10 yet, go and download it from this link.
