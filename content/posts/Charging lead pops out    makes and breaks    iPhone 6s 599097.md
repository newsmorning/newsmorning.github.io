Introduction:
In today's world, your smartphone is your lifeline. It connects you with your loved ones, work, and the world. With this in mind, it's easy to see why smartphone users cherish and take care of their devices. They do everything possible to keep their phones functioning optimally. However, recent reports have revealed that iPhone 6S users are struggling to keep their phones working correctly. The charging leads pop out, leading to significant breaks. In this article, we explore the causes of this phenomenon, how to avoid this issue, and what happens next.

What Causes the Charging Leads to Pop out of iPhone 6S?
The charging leads of iPhone 6S popping out of the phone is a common issue that many users have reported. But what triggers this issue? The problem is usually caused by the charging port not fitting tightly into the phone. This is often due to the accumulation of dust, dirt, and other debris inside the port. When the charging port can't fit tightly enough, the charging cable can also become loose. This causes the charging leads to pop out of the device, leading to significant damage.

How can You Avoid iPhone 6S Charging Lead Popping Out?
One of the best ways to avoid this problem is by cleaning the charging port regularly. You can use a toothbrush or a small brush to remove any lint, dust, or dirt from the charging port. You can also use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol and a cotton swab to clean the port. This will help keep the charging cable tightly in place, providing an excellent fit, and preventing it from popping out.

What Happens Next?
If your iPhone 6S charging lead pops out, it's essential to be cautious. Attempting to force it back in may cause significant damage to your phone. Instead, seek the help of a professional. This could be an Apple Store or a certified repairer who can help to assess the damage and offer a solution. In some cases, the charging port may need to be replaced. In other instances, the entire phone may need to be replaced, depending on the extent of the damage.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, iPhone 6S users must be cautious when dealing with this issue. Avoid trying to fix the problem yourself and instead seek the help of a professional. Let's hope that Apple can find a permanent solution to this problem in the future. Nonetheless, for now, cleaning the charging port regularly can help prevent the charging lead from popping out and causing significant damage. After all, prevention is always better than cure.

## Chosen Solution
 Tried several leads and have trouble with the charging - seems as though the lead / plug does not seat properly.
Charge circuit “makes and breaks” .
Any clues ?

 By lead are you referring to the Lightning cable end? If it does not fully seat into the charging port then there is some type of obstruction in the actual charging port. Often times lint, dust, debris, dirt, etc from our daily use, our clothing can get stuck in the charger-port.
I would gently insert a paperclip or if you have fine tipped tweezers gently remove the items. Be careful there are vital pins in the socket that if damaged will not operate properly when you charge again.
