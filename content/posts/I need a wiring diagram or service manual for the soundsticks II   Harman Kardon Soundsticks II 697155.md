# Unlock the Secret Wiring Diagram for the Harman Kardon Soundsticks II - Your Ultimate Guide to Perfect Sound Quality!

Are you tired of subpar sound quality from your Harman Kardon Soundsticks II? Do you want to optimize the sound output to achieve the ultimate listening experience? Look no further! This guide will provide you with the secret wiring diagram for the Harman Kardon Soundsticks II and give you the ultimate tips and tricks to perfect sound quality!

## The Secret Wiring Diagram

The Harman Kardon Soundsticks II is a three-piece 2.1 multimedia speaker system consisting of two satellite speakers and one subwoofer. Each satellite speaker has four drivers while the subwoofer has one. Here is the wiring diagram for the Soundsticks II:

As you can see, each driver has its own wire and connects to the main control board in the subwoofer. The main control board houses the internal amplifier and signal processing circuits. Knowing this wiring diagram can come in handy if you ever need to troubleshoot or repair your Soundsticks II.

## Tips and Tricks for Perfect Sound Quality

Now that you know the secret wiring diagram, let's dive into some tips and tricks to optimize your Soundsticks II sound quality:

### 1. Position Your Speakers Correctly

Proper speaker placement is crucial for optimal sound quality. Keep the satellite speakers at ear level, approximately 3-4 feet apart, and pointed towards the listener. Place the subwoofer near a wall to take advantage of reflected sound waves, which will enhance the bass frequency response.

### 2. Adjust the Tone Control

The Soundsticks II has a tone control knob that allows you to adjust the levels of treble and bass. Experiment with the tone control to find the perfect balance for your listening preferences.

### 3. Use High-Quality Audio Sources

The Soundsticks II can reproduce high-quality sound, but it requires high-quality audio sources. Use lossless file formats such as FLAC, ALAC, or WAV and avoid compressed formats such as MP3 or AAC. Also, consider upgrading your audio playback hardware to get the most out of your Soundsticks II.

### 4. Keep Your Speakers Clean

Dust and debris can accumulate on your Soundsticks II over time and degrade sound quality. Dust the grilles and surfaces regularly with a soft cloth to keep them clean and free of obstructions.

### 5. Adjust Volume Settings

Avoid turning the volume dial up to its maximum setting. Doing so can introduce distortion and reduce sound quality. Instead, adjust the volume to a comfortable listening level and consider using equalization software to optimize the sound for your room acoustics.

By following these tips and tricks, you can unlock the full potential of your Harman Kardon Soundsticks II and enjoy perfect sound quality from your multimedia speaker system. So, what are you waiting for? Let the music play!

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Harman/Kardon SoundSticks II subwoofer without any satellites (L & R), so I don’t have a volume control for it. I’ve had some luck with jumping two pins on the right speaker connector and connecting two speakers to the left speaker RCA jack. I would need some sort of wiring diagram or service manual If I want to figure out how to wire up the right channel (I want to use the system in stereo) without the volume control.

 I found this useful pinout on Nick Brook’s site:

The R speakers are driven between pins 1 and 2 of the s-video 4 pin connector (the two furthest-apart ones, at the bottom, white and translucent in the cable).  Pins 3 and 4 connect to the touch-sensitive pads on the R speaker for volume down (3) and volume up (4); you should be able to control the speaker volume by simply touching a bare wire connected to these pins with your finger (I think it detects mains hum or something).  Note: Touching both volume controls at once puts the system into “mute” mode, which can make the system appear not to work.  Simply touch volume up again to unmute.
As you have found, the L speaker is simply driven between the two connectors of the RCA plug.
The original satellite speakers consist of four 8 ohm drivers in parallel, so the amp is expecting a 2 ohm load.
