# Unlock The Secret Formula to Double Your Retirement Savings with Deferred Annuities - Find Out How To Calculate PV Now!

Are you looking for a reliable way to double your retirement savings? Do you wish to enjoy a comfortable and stress-free retirement without worrying about running out of money? If yes, then deferred annuities might be just what you need.

Deferred annuities are a type of insurance product that provides a guaranteed income stream in retirement. Unlike immediate annuities, which start paying out immediately, deferred annuities allow your money to grow tax-deferred for a set period before you start receiving payments.

The key advantage of deferred annuities is that they offer an effective way to accumulate and grow your retirement savings. By deferring payments, you give your money more time to compound and grow, resulting in a much larger payout when you retire.

To understand how deferred annuities work and what their potential benefits are, let's first take a closer look at the types of annuities available. There are primarily two types of annuities: fixed and variable.

Fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return, which means your payout is locked in and will not be affected by market fluctuations. On the other hand, variable annuities are invested in the stock market and thus offer the potential for higher returns, but also come with higher risks.

Deferred annuities can be either fixed or variable, or a combination of both. With a fixed deferred annuity, you can choose how long you want to defer your payments, typically ranging from 5 to 10 years. During this time, your money will earn a fixed interest rate, meaning you know exactly how much you'll receive when you start taking payments.

By contrast, variable deferred annuities offer more flexibility but also more risk. With a variable annuity, you can choose from different investment options, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Your payout will depend on the performance of your investments, which can fluctuate over time.

To calculate the potential payout of deferred annuities, you need to use a concept called present value (PV). PV is the current value of a future payment, adjusted for inflation and the time value of money. In other words, it measures how much money you need today to receive a certain amount in the future.

The formula for calculating PV involves three key variables: the amount of the future payment (FV), the interest rate (r), and the number of years until the payment is due (n). The formula looks like this:

PV = FV / (1 + r)n

Let's say you're planning to invest $100,000 in a fixed deferred annuity that pays out in 15 years with a guaranteed interest rate of 3%. To calculate the PV of your investment, you can plug in the variables:

FV = $100,000
r = 3%
n = 15

PV = $100,000 / (1 + 3%)15

PV = $54,323.89

This means that if you invest $54,323.89 today, you can expect to receive $100,000 in 15 years when your deferred annuity payout starts.

Of course, this is just a hypothetical example, and your actual payout will depend on a variety of factors, such as the type of deferred annuity you choose, the length of the deferral period, and the performance of your investments.

In conclusion, deferred annuities can be an excellent tool for growing and protecting your retirement savings. By deferring payments and using a concept called present value, you can calculate the potential payout of your deferred annuities and plan accordingly. So, what are you waiting for?

## Formula to Calculate Present Value of Deferred Annuity
 
An annuity is the series of periodic payments received by an investor on a future date, and the term “deferred annuity” refers to the delayed annuity in the form of installment or lump-sum payments rather than an immediate stream of income. It is basically the present value of the future annuity payment. The formula for a deferred annuity based on an ordinary annuity (where the annuity payment is made at the end of each period) is calculated using ordinary annuity payment, the effective rate of interestEffective Rate Of InterestEffective Interest Rate, also called Annual Equivalent Rate, is the actual rate of interest that a person pays or earns on a financial instrument by considering the compounding interest over a given period.read more, number of periods of payment, and deferred periods.

where,
 
- P Ordinary = Ordinary annuity paymentr = Effective rate of interestn = No. of periodst = Deferred periods

 
The formula for a deferred annuity based on annuity due (where the annuity payment is made at the start of each period) is calculated using annuity payment due, effective rate of interest, a number of periods of payment, and deferred periods.
 
Deferred Annuity based on annuity due, is represented as,
 
where
 
- P Due = Annuity payment duer = Effective rate of interestn = No. of periodst = Deferred periods

 
### Deferred Annuity Calculation (Step by Step)
 
The formula for deferred annuity using ordinary annuity can be derived by using the following steps:
 
- Step 1: Firstly, ascertain the annuity payment and confirm whether the payment will be made at the end of each period. It is denoted by P Ordinary.Step 2: Next, calculate the effective rate of interest by dividing the annualized rate of interest by the number of periodic payments in a year and it is denoted by r. r = Annualized rate of interest / No. periodic payments in a yearStep 3: Next, calculate the total number of periods, which is the product of a number of years and number of periodic payments in a year, and it is denoted by n. n = No. of years * No. of periodic payments in a yearStep 4: Next, determine the period of payment deferment, and it is denoted by t.Step 5: Finally, the deferred annuity can be derived using ordinary annuityOrdinary AnnuityAn ordinary annuity refers to recurring payments of equal value made at regular intervals for a fixed period. The frequency of these consecutive payments can be weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly.read more payment (step 1), an effective rate of interest rate (step 2), a number of periods of payment (step 3), and deferred periods (step 4), as shown below.

 
Deferred Annuity = P Ordinary * [1 – (1 + r)-n] / [(1 + r)t * r]
 
The formula for deferred annuity using annuity due can be derived by using the following steps:
 
- Step 1: Firstly, ascertain the annuity payment and confirm whether the payment will be made at the start of each period. It is denoted by P Due.Step 2: Next, calculate the effective rate of interest by dividing the annualized rate of interest by the number of periodic payments in a year, and it is denoted by r. i.e., r = Annualized rate of interest / No. periodic payments in a yearStep 3: Next, calculate the total number of periods, which is the product of the number of years and number of periodic payments in a year, and it is denoted by n. i.e., n = No. of years * No. of periodic payments in a yearStep 4: Next, determine the period of payment deferment, and it is denoted by t.Step 5: Finally, the deferred annuity can be derived using annuity payment due (step 1), the effective rate of interest rate (step 2), the number of periods of payment (step 3), and deferred periods (step 4) as shown below.

 
Deferred Annuity = P Due * [1 – (1 + r)-n] / [(1 + r)t-1 * r]
 
### Examples
 
Let us take the example of John, who got a deal to lend $60,000 today, and in return, he will receive twenty-five annual payments of $6,000 each. The annuity will start five years from now, and the effective rate of interest will be 6%. Determine whether the deal is a feasible one for John if the payment is an ordinary annuity and annuity due.
 
- Given, P Ordinary = $6,000,000r = 6%n = 25 yearst = 5 years

 
Calculation of Deferred Annuity if payment is Ordinary Due
 
Therefore, the deferred annuity can be calculated as,
 
- Deferred Annuity = $6,000 * [1 – (1 + 6%)-25] / [(1 + 6%)5 * 6%]

 
Deferred Annuity will be –
 
Deferred Annuity = $57,314.80 ~ $57,315
 
n this case, John shouldn’t lend the money as the value of the deferred annuity is less than $60,000.
 
Calculation of Deferred Annuity if payment is Annuity Due
 
- Given, P Due = $6,000,000r = 6%n = 25 yearst = 5 years

 
- Deferred Annuity = $6,000 * [1 – (1 + 6%)-25] / [(1 + 6%)5-1 * 6%]

 
Deferred Annuity = $60,753.69 ~ $60,754
 
In this case, John should lend the money as the value of the deferred annuity is more than $60,000.
 
### Relevance and Uses
 
From the perspective of an investor, deferred annuities are mainly useful for the purpose of tax deferral of earnings because of a lack of restrictions on the amount of its annual investment coupled with the guarantee of the lifelong source of income. However, one of the major drawbacks of an annuity is that its gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, which is higher than the long-term capital gains tax rate.
