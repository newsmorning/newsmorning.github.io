If you’re a proud owner of the Nintendo Wii, you must have experienced the annoyance of a flickering screen. It can be frustrating not only for gamers but also for those who use the Wii for other purposes. The last thing you would want is to have your screen constantly flickering, especially when you’re playing your favorite games or streaming your favorite shows on Netflix. 

But did you know that the A/V jack on your Nintendo Wii could be the root cause of this issue? Well, don’t worry, we've got some good news - you can easily fix it yourself at home without having to spend a lot of money.

 Read on to learn all about what causes the A/V jack of your Nintendo Wii to cause screen flicker and how you can fix it quickly and easily:

### What Causes Screen Flicker on the Nintendo Wii?

The Nintendo Wii is known for its innovative technology that allows players to control the game using gestures and movement. However, like any technology, it has its flaws, and one of them is screen flicker. 

The main reason for this issue is that Nintendo Wii carries both audio and video signals through a single A/V jack. When users connect the Nintendo Wii to their TV, the audio and video signals are separated, which means that the TV has to work harder to process the signals separately, resulting in flickering.

### How to Fix the Nintendo Wii Screen Flicker Issue

Now that you know the causes of the problem, it's time to learn how to fix it. You will need a few essential components before starting, including:

-	A new set of A/V cables for your Nintendo Wii
-	A TV or a computer monitor with RCA inputs

Please note that you would need to buy the RCA components separately as the Nintendo Wii comes with standard audio/video cables.

Here are the steps to fix the Nintendo Wii screen flicker issue:

Step 1: Turn off Your Nintendo Wii

Before we start working to fix the screen flicker issue, make sure to turn off your Nintendo Wii.

Step 2: Disconnect the A/V Jack

Next, you should disconnect the A/V jack from the back of the Nintendo Wii. You can do this by pulling out the plug. This will fully disconnect both audio and video signals.

Step 3: Connect RCA Cables

Now that you have disconnected the A/V jack, it's time to connect the RCA cables. You have to attach the yellow and white cables to the corresponding inputs, which are usually labeled as “Video In” and “Audio In” respectively.

Step 4: Connect the Other End of the RCA Cables

Now you have to connect the other end of the RCA cables to your TV or monitor. You have to be sure to make sure that you are connecting the yellow and white cables to the "Video In" and "Audio In” ports.

Step 5: Turn On Your Nintendo Wii

You can finally turn on your Nintendo Wii and check to see if the screen flicker issue is resolved.

### Conclusion

Screen flicker issues can be a hassle, but fortunately, fixing them is not too complicated. By following these basic steps, you can easily fix your Nintendo Wii’s screen flicker problems. So, what are you waiting for? Get the necessary equipment, and get started today!

## Chosen Solution
 My wii keeps losing video/audio.  It happens intermittently.  I've determinded it's something with the A/V jack on the back of the console.  When in "jiggle" the cable at the console connector back and forth the audio/video cuts in and out.  Sometimes the video stays on but the colors don't appear correct.
is there an easy fix for this?  i'm not afraid of tearing it apart and doing a little solder-work.  Just don't know where to start or what to look for...

 The first place to start would be the cable itself,  it might have a kink in it therefore causing the bad connection. If you hold it in a certain position does the picture and audio come back? That would probably be the simplest way to fix it, but not permanent.  Then move on to the connector itself, does it feel more loose than normal?  if so, then its most likely a bad soldier joint. One more thing to consider is the contact pins might be bent out of alignment but thats probably not the case.  iFixit sells Wii motherboards, but they're a bit pricy.  See if you can find a Wii on Ebay for parts, and unsolder the AV connector form the bad one and put it in yours.
Good luck.
