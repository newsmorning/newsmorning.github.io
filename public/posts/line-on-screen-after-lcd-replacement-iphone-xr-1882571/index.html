If you’ve recently replaced the LCD screen on your iPhone XR and noticed a mysterious line on your screen, you’re not alone. Many iPhone XR users have reported the appearance of a strange line on their screens after a DIY LCD replacement. But what exactly is causing this issue, and how can you fix it?\nFirst, it’s essential to understand that the iPhone XR uses an advanced LCD technology called “Liquid Retina Display.” This technology allows for a more precise, vibrant display with deeper blacks and brighter whites. However, the downside of using Liquid Retina technology is that it requires a more intricate installation process than other LCD screens, making DIY repairs more challenging.\nWhen performing an iPhone XR LCD replacement, the ribbon cable that connects the screen to the motherboard must be handled with extreme care. If the cable is creased, bent, or twisted during the installation process, it can result in a mysterious line appearing on your screen.\nThis line is typically located near the top or bottom of the screen and can be either a faint grey line or a harsh, neon-colored line. The issue can occur regardless of the quality of the replacement screen you’ve used, as it’s more likely caused by human error during the installation process.\nThankfully, there are ways to fix the issue. If the line is a faint grey line, one possible solution is to use a small piece of electrical tape to secure the ribbon cable flat against the back of the LCD screen. However, if the line is a harsh, neon-colored line, the only solution is to replace the entire LCD screen again.\nWhile it’s tempting to save money and perform an iPhone XR LCD replacement yourself, it’s crucial to recognize the risks involved. Even a small mistake during the installation process can result in a costly repair. It’s always safer to let a professional handle it if you’re not 100% confident in your abilities.\nIn conclusion, if you’ve recently replaced your iPhone XR’s LCD screen and noticed a mysterious line on your screen, don’t panic. The issue is more common than you might think and can be easily fixed with the right tools and techniques. However, it’s important to recognize the risks involved in performing DIY repairs and to seek professional help if needed.\nChosen Solution Since replacing my iPhone XR screen i’ve had this black (sometimes white) line appear when pressure is applied to the bottom right corner of the screen. If i separate the screen and phone with a layer of electrical tape the issue doesn’t occur. I assume this is some sort of electrical interference but cant seem to isolate what is causing it. Any suggestions would be much appreciated :)\nThere are two possibilities here; either the replacement screen is defective or you may have incorrectly assembled the screen. If you still have access to the original screen, you could try installing that one to see if the problem persists. If it does, there may be some damage to the logic board (probably the connectors). If it doesn’t, the go through this guide to double-check your work as some screens, especially lower cost aftermarket screens can be thicker and cause issues with pressure points. Also, was the replacement screen a “complete” screen with small parts or did you have to transfer everything over? Pre-populated parts can be problematic but transferring parts can lead to alignment issues. Do some more testing and verification and come back with more details. Final question, is the picture of the phone innards your device or a photo from the web? It has an awful lot of scratches, markings and the battery looks like it has seen better days. Let us know if the phone has been previously repaired.\nI think you need to try reconnecting the display to the phone. True, for this you will need answers and little experience in repairing such devices. Although it seems to me that it’s best for you to turn to the master who replaced the screen for you.\nMost likely it’s nothing than a damaged screen, thos line are normal for damaged screen, the reconection with motherboard will chang nothing, or there is possibility of cracked pin in phone connector, but this thing is the best check on another lcd.\nHi Elisha i Repair iPhones for a living and that is a screen faulty and Make sure the battery is disconnected because that can damage the screen.\n","wordCount":"761","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lazaro Truitt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/line-on-screen-after-lcd-replacement-iphone-xr-1882571/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>iPhone XR LCD Replacement Gone Wrong?
