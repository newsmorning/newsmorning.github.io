# MacBook Air 11 Mid 2013 Screen Almost DESTROYED By Liquid Damage - How This ONE TRICK Saved The Day!

We all know how terrible it feels when an accident happens to our beloved MacBook. One of the most common accidents is liquid spillage on the keyboard or screen. It's a real nightmare because it can cause damage to the inner components and can cost a pretty penny to repair.

When I spilled coffee on the screen of my MacBook Air 11 Mid 2013, I thought it was game-over for my trusty laptop. But with a bit of internet research, I learned a trick that saved the day. In this article, Iâ€™ll share that trick with you. 

## Here's what happened to my MacBook Air 11 Mid 2013 Screen

I was in the middle of my morning work routine, sipping on coffee and typing away when, out of nowhere, my cat jumped on the keyboard, causing me to spill coffee all over the screen. I quickly shut the laptop and unplugged it from the charger. My heart sank as I realized what had just happened. 

I soaked up as much of the liquid as I could with a cloth and let the laptop dry for a few hours. When I turned it on again, everything seemed fine. But after a few minutes of use, the screen started flickering and displaying strange colors. I couldn't believe it. I had heard that liquid damage was irreparable and that I would have to replace the entire screen of my MacBook Air 11 Mid 2013.

## How I fixed my MacBook Air 11 Mid 2013 Screen with ONE TRICK

After researching online, I found out about the magic of using a hairdryer on a medium heat setting to dry out the liquid. The theory is that by heating the damaged area, the water molecules will evaporate and leave the components unharmed. 

I decided to give it a try. I plugged in my hairdryer, set it to medium heat, and aimed it at the damaged area of my screen. I held the hairdryer about 6 inches away and kept it there for about an hour.

After an hour, I let the laptop cool down and turned it on again. I was amazed to see that the flickering had stopped, and the strange colors were gone! My MacBook Air 11 Mid 2013 screen was back to normal! 

## Conclusion

Although spilling liquid on your MacBook is always a stressful experience, there's hope for avoiding costly repairs. By using a simple hairdryer on a medium heat setting, you may be able to save your laptop from screen damage caused by liquid spills. 

I hope my experience and the ONE TRICK I learned will help you avoid potential costly repairs in the future.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a mid 2013 Macbook air A1465 that I spilled water on 2 years ago. Ever since I have been using it with an HDMI monitor. Recently I decided I want to fix it myself. But then I found someone who would replace it for 99 bucks if I buy my own parts. I can still see the screen with a flashlight. The apple logo does not light up. What parts should I buy?
