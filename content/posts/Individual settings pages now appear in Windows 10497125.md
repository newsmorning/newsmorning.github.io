# Windows 10 Just Got a Major Upgrade: Check Out the Revolutionary New Individual Settings Pages Now!

As we all know, Windows 10 is one of the most popular operating systems available for computers. Microsoft has been continuously improving it with regular updates to make it better, faster, and more secure. And the latest upgrade is no exception, as it has introduced a revolutionary new feature that will change the way we interact with the system's settings pages.

In the past, users had to navigate through various menus and options to find what they were looking for in the settings panel. This process was often cumbersome, time-consuming, and confusing, especially for beginners or those unfamiliar with the inner workings of Windows. But with the latest update, Windows 10 has introduced individual settings pages, which allow users to access a particular setting directly without navigating through menus.

Individual settings pages are, in essence, a streamlined version of the overall settings panel. They allow users to access a specific setting, modify it if necessary, and go back without having to navigate through multiple menus. The new feature makes it much easier to find and adjust the settings that matter to the user. Moreover, it makes the overall settings panel more organized, with each setting having its dedicated page.

So what makes these new individual settings pages so revolutionary? For starters, they save time and effort by letting users access a specific setting directly. Let’s say you want to change the wallpaper on your desktop. Earlier, to do so, you had to navigate through Personalization -> Background -> Choose Your Picture. With the new individual settings pages, you can access the wallpaper setting directly from the Personalization category. This way, you can modify it in no time, without going through the other options offered under the Personalization category.

Another great thing about the new individual settings pages is that they make it easier for users to discover new settings. Many users are unaware of the various settings available on their system, or they don't know where to find them. With the individual settings pages, users can browse through different categories and see all the related settings in one place. This feature makes it much easier to discover and modify settings that users may not have been aware of earlier.

The individual settings pages also make it easier for Microsoft to add new settings without cluttering the already complex settings panel. By introducing new pages for new settings, Microsoft can ensure that the overall settings panel remains organized with each setting having its dedicated page. This way, users can easily find and adjust new settings as they are introduced.

To sum it up, the individual settings pages are an excellent addition to Windows 10. They make it easier for users to find and modify settings, save time and effort, and keep the overall settings panel organized. If you are a Windows user, make sure to check out the new settings pages and enjoy the hassle-free experience of managing your system's settings. So, what are you waiting for, upgrade your Windows 10 now!

Windows 10’s settings app is one of the most important features of the system. Therefore, Microsoft needs to keep it as functional as possible and occasionally deliver some improvements and additions here and there.
 
Windows 10 Preview build 14328 brought a couple enhancements to the Settings app in Windows 10 Preview, both of which functionality and design related. Microsoft made it easier for users to use the Settings app by introducing new icons to each Settings page and the ability to pin every section to the Start Menu. Along with these changes, the Settings app also received a better search algorithm for more accurate search results.
 
As is the case on Windows 10 Mobile, all Settings pages now have their own icons no matter if the pages are major ones or sub-pages. This will enhance the look of the Settings app and allow users to more easily navigate through the app. In addition, when you search for a specific page in the Settings app search bar, a drop-down with page suggestions will show up so you can instantly open it. This drop-down works the same way as drop-downs in your browser or the Windows Store.
 
For even easier access to a specific Settings page, you can pin the page you use the most to the Start Menu. To pin a desired page, open the Settings app, right-click on the page you want to pin, and choose Pin to Start. You can pin absolutely any Settings page to the Start Menu whether it’s a major category or a sub-category. Finally, some Settings, like the Taskbar, received their own pages, so users now have the option to customize even more Windows 10 features.
