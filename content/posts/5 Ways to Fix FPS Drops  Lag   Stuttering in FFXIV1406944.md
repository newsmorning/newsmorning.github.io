Revive Your FFXIV Gaming Experience with These 5 Ultimate FPS Solutions!

Final Fantasy XIV or FFXIV, the popular MMORPG video game that has captivated players worldwide, has seen a considerable rise in its popularity over the past few years. With a vast and immersive world filled with diverse characters and exciting adventures, FFXIV has cemented its place as one of the best games in its genre. However, for players who are looking to elevate their gaming experience, especially when it comes to framerate or FPS, it is essential to have a well-equipped system to support it. In this article, we will guide you through the five ultimate FPS solutions that can help you revive your FFXIV gaming experience.

1. Upgrade Your Graphics Card 

One of the most important factors affecting FPS is the graphics card or GPU installed in your system. A graphics card with higher VRAM, clock speeds, and core count can get you a bump in FPS, resulting in a smoother gameplay experience. NVIDIA's RTX or AMD's RX series graphics cards have proven to be an excellent fit for FFXIV. They offer great performance and can run modern games flawlessly, providing superior immersion to high-quality graphics.

2. Check Your Game Settings 

Sometimes, the game settings can also influence the FPS rate. It's essential to balance the graphics quality with the performance by tweaking them according to your system's capabilities. You can start by disabling settings such as unnecessary shadows, motion blur, or ambient occlusion, which strain the GPU and ultimately lower FPS. Turn off anti-aliasing or reduce its values to improve FPS even further.

3. Overclock Your CPU 

Overclocking your CPU can provide a substantial boost to FPS. It involves pushing the CPU frequency beyond the manufacturer's recommended limits, resulting in increased performance. It is crucial to check your CPU's voltage limits and keep an eye on the temperatures before attempting overclocking. Also, make sure your system's cooling is adequate to support the additional heat generated.

4. Optimize Your Network 

Network optimization plays a significant role in online gaming, and FFXIV is no exception. A stable and fast connection ensures smooth gameplay and avoids lags and FPS drops. One way to optimize your network is by using a wired Ethernet connection as it provides better speed and stability than Wi-Fi. You can also use software like ExitLag or WTFast that optimize network routing to reduce latency and improve FPS.

5. Use Gaming Optimization Software 

There are several software available in the market that can optimize your system performance specifically for gaming. They can clear your system's cache, prioritize game resources, and provide real-time performance monitoring. Some of the popular software in this category are Razer Cortex, Game Fire, and AVG TuneUp.

In conclusion, FFXIV is an immersive and enjoyable game, but to elevate your gaming experience, ensuring smooth FPS rates is essential. By following the above five ultimate FPS solutions, you can revive your FFXIV gaming experience and take it to the next level. Upgrade your hardware, tweak game settings, overclock the CPU, optimize your network, and use gaming optimization software to unlock your system's true potential. Finally, always ensure that your system's cooling is adequate to support the overclocking and keep an eye out for the temperatures. Happy gaming!

Experiencing FPS drop, lag, and stuttering in your games is frustrating because it affects your gameplay. It can make your game slow and unstable to play.
 
The FPS drop is an issue common to virtually every game you can think of. However, players complain that this problem significantly affects the Final Fantasy XIV game. 
 
Hence, we’ll discuss the FPS drops in the FFXIV game, their causes, and how you can fix it.
 
## Why is FFXIV laggy and choppy?
 
- Outdated or corrupt graphics driver: The graphic driver is responsible for whatever displays on your computer screen. However, you may experience FPS drops and a lag in your game if the graphics driver is outdated. Likewise, the driver may be corrupt, causing it to malfunction and affecting your PC. So, you may experience the FFXIV Endwalker FPS drops if your graphics driver is not up-to-date.
 - Game DVR interference: Players may also experience difficulties with their game if the Game DVR feature on their PC is enabled. This feature consumes system resources and can affect the number of resources left for the Final Fantasy XIV game to run with. So, if your PC isn’t a high-end PC and doesn’t have enough resources, you may encounter the FFXIV FPS drop in 2022.
 - PC not matching the Final Fantasy XIV game requirements: Numerous issues aside, the FPS drop, lag, and stuttering can erupt if you don’t adhere to the game’s requirements policy. Because the game demands more resources, not all PCs can play it. So, your FPS can drop in Final Fantasy XIV if your computer doesn’t match the requirements.
