All you’ll need is a socket wrench, a torque wrench, and a replacement sensor.\nHere are the steps to follow when replacing your sensors:\nLocate the malfunctioning sensor. In most Honda Accords, the crankshaft and camshaft sensors are located near the engine’s front.\nDisconnect the battery. Always ensure to disconnect the car’s battery as you work on your car’s electrical system. Unclip the sensors from their sockets, and unscrew the bolts with the socket wrench.\nRemove the old sensors. Take off the sensors and ensure to clean the area where the sensors were placed. If your sensors are dirty, this is a great opportunity to clean them up.\nInstall the new sensors. Place your new sensors in the correct orientation and tighten the bolts with the torque wrench. Reconnect the sensors to their sockets.\nConnect the battery. After replacing the sensors, connect the battery and start the engine. Verify if any error codes have been cleared.\nWith these simple steps, you can replace your Accord’s crankshaft and camshaft sensors and get back to enjoying the smooth and reliable performance that you expect from your car.\nGet the Best Quality Sensors for Your Car When replacing your faulty sensors, always go for the best quality products. High-quality sensors last longer, perform better, and provide accurate data to your car’s computer.\nSome reliable brands that make quality sensors for your Honda Accord include Bosch, Denso, and NGK. These brands offer durable, reliable, and high-quality sensors that are perfect for your car.\nConclusion In conclusion, replacing the crankshaft and camshaft sensors is a simple process that can be done in a few minutes.

I got to change the crankshaft sensor as the car stopped in the middle of the road, i got freelancer changed it for me, afterward the engine light didnot went off and the mechanic told me I had to change the camshaft sensor too, But After doing so the engine light still on and make longer crank sound and engine light still on, does both of them need to be relearned or there are any other problem with the wires of the cranshaft or camshaft???\nMost likely, you’ll need to either take your own OBDII reader and reset the engine codes or find someone who has one and have them reset the codes to get that light turned off. Chances are, everything is fine, it just hasn’t been reset in your cars\nthe sensors shouldn’t be going faulty at that mileage, they are telling you something is wrong, probably one of 2 things, if you have replaced the sensors check the wiring for them isn’t damaged and get your timing checked, couple of symtoms of bad timing are car randomly stalling, issues trying to start it, those codes may pop up, fuel MPG will go down. get a mechanic to check and give you a diagnosis, they may clear the codes and k you to drive it until they re-appear again. if its timing related don’t leave it to get worse as it may cost you an engine rebuild if something snaps and the valves hit the pistons.\n","wordCount":"896","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-26T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-26T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Molly Williams"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/changed-cranshaft-and-camshaft-sensor-both-but-engine-light-shows-up-2008-2012-honda-accord-1976734/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe What Happened After Changing Crankshaft and Camshaft Sensors in Your Honda Accord!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-26 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 26, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;896 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Molly Williams</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-importance-of-crankshaft-and-camshaft-sensors>The Importance of Crankshaft and Camshaft Sensors</a></li><li><a href=#the-process-of-replacing-the-sensors>The Process of Replacing the Sensors</a></li><li><a href=#get-the-best-quality-sensors-for-your-car>Get the Best Quality Sensors for Your Car</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe What Happened After Changing Crankshaft and Camshaft Sensors in Your Honda Accord!</p><p>Subtitle: Everything You Need to Know About Fixing Your Car with the Best Quality Sensors</p><hr><p>If you own a Honda Accord, chances are you might have faced some issues with your engine.
