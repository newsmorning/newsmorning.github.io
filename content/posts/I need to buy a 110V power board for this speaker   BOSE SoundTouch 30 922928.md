## Chosen Solution
 I need to buy a 110V power board for this speaker, can someone please tell me where they are sold/available.

 Ishit kuntal The part number for that is 3 54778-001. The problem is that it does not look like it is available anywhere but used on ebay.com You can however, take your power board and have it repaired by a decent workshop (depends on where you are of course). If not you can try and contact Bose with that part number and see if they can help you out.
