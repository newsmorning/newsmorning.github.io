# You Won't Believe What Just Happened to My Macbook Pro - A Quarter of My Screen is Completely Gone!

I was working on an important project on my Macbook Pro when suddenly, a quarter of my screen went completely blank. I tried restarting my laptop, adjusting the brightness and contrast settings, but nothing seemed to work. My heart sank as I realized that my trusty Macbook Pro had just become somewhat dysfunctional - and I had no idea what had caused this issue.

To be honest, I was devastated. I depend heavily on my Macbook Pro for work and personal tasks every day, and the thought of it being damaged was crippling. It felt like a part of me was missing, and I was left feeling helpless about what to do next.

After going through a few online forums and troubleshooting my laptop, I discovered that there could be several reasons for such screen issues. It could be a problem with the graphics card, a faulty macOS update, a physical issue with the display, or even something as simple as a loose cable connection.

I decided to take my Macbook Pro to a certified Apple repair center, hoping that they would be able to fix the problem. I was greeted by a friendly technician who examined my laptop and told me that the problem was likely caused by a faulty connector cable. He explained how the display is made up of several connectors, and one of these had become loose, causing the screen to lose a quarter of its function.

The technician was able to fix the problem in a matter of minutes by simply reseating the connector cable. I was surprised and relieved that such a quick and easy fix could solve such a frustrating issue.

I left the repair center with a newly restored Macbook Pro and a newfound appreciation for the skillset of certified technicians. From now on, I am determined to take better care of my laptop and ensure that it remains in a good condition.

If you are someone who relies heavily on their laptops like me, always remember to take good care of them. And, if you ever encounter a problem like a quarter of your screen going blank, know that it might not be as complicated as it seems.

In conclusion, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, do not hesitate to take your laptop to a certified repair center. Their expertise and knowledge can help you repair your laptop quickly and efficiently, thereby saving you a lot of time and frustration.

## Chosen Solution
 I just want to share my suffering with other Apple fans. If you have some advice or links to related topics please share. When I woke up today, everything worked fine. I watched some YouTube videos, went to the gym and when I returned back this happens!

Unfortunately, my MBP 2016 is just out of warranty. Bought in December 2016 (in Czechia, EU we have 2 years warranty).
I am still confused about why the !&&* this happened. I had no issue before with my MBP before except keyboard which I learned how to clean every week with pressured canned air.
I have never smashed that screen, hard closed the lid or dropped the MBP on the ground. It just happened after 2+ years of daily use.
I love Apple but I am p***** that I had to use warranty service 2 times for broken keyboard and then when the device is just out of warranty the screen breaks. This is not how I imagine the built quality of the device that cost me ~$2400.
I am not sure if I will be able to repair it by myself from what I have found the repair cost will be about $500-$750. I wish there was
I really needed to share this with somebody, I hope you guys will understand.

 Wow that’s unfortunate. My 13” 2016 occasionally has glitches that look like that, only in smaller sections and very briefly, so it doesn’t really affect anything I do yet. But I suspect it’s getting worse :(
My assumption would be it’s something to do with the “flexgate” issues plaguing the 2016-17 models. My only hope is that Apple gets hit with some class-action lawsuits because their behavior recently is honestly unacceptable. They’ve been shipping defective products and turning a blind eye to the people affected. I’m definitely not looking forward to my MBP developing the same issues you’re facing.
