Have you recently repaired your iPhone5's lightning connector and battery, but now find that your home button is no longer functioning properly? If so, you may be surprised to learn that the issue is likely caused by the way the repair was performed.

It is important to note that the iPhone5's home button is connected to the device's logic board in a way that is different from other iPhone models. In order to properly repair the lightning connector and battery on an iPhone5, it is necessary to remove the logic board. However, if the repair technician is not careful, the home button's connection to the logic board can become damaged, resulting in issues such as a non-responsive or erratic home button.

So, how can you prevent this issue from happening when repairing your iPhone5? The key is to choose a reputable repair shop that has experience working specifically with iPhone5 models. This will ensure that the repair technician knows exactly how to handle the device without causing any unintended damage.

If you have already experienced this issue and your home button is no longer functioning properly, don't worry - there are still options available to you. In some cases, the home button's connection to the logic board can be repaired or replaced, allowing the button to function normally once again.

However, it is important to note that repairing the home button on an iPhone5 is a delicate process that should only be performed by a qualified repair technician. Attempting to repair the home button yourself or bringing it to an inexperienced repair shop could result in further damage to your device.

In conclusion, if you have recently repaired your iPhone5's lightning connector and battery and are now experiencing issues with your home button, the root cause is likely due to the repair process itself. To avoid this issue, be sure to choose a reputable repair shop that has experience working with iPhone5 models. And if you are already experiencing issues with your home button, seek out the help of a qualified repair technician to ensure that your device is repaired correctly and safely.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey there ifixit'ers
I just replaced the battery and lightning connector in my iphone 5 using the ifixit guides and tools.
When I tighten the left side pentalobe screw in, the home button stops working.
If I leave it loose and pry it up a little bit, it works fine.
I imagine it has to do with those gold terminals on the left side, but I can't understand why tightening the connection makes it fail and loosening it makes it work fine again.
In the meantime, to avoid dust, I enabled assistive touch and tightened the left side of the screen.
What should I do when re-assembling the phone to ensure the home button connects properly and works?
It worked fine before doing the repair.

 Sometimes if anything is not seated properly, it could cause the slightest things to stop working or not work at all when other things are tightened properly. Have you checked to make sure everything is snug and fully fitted/seated?
