# Discover the Surprising Solution to Restore Your iPhone 4 Charge Circuit - Say Goodbye to Low Battery Woes!

Are you struggling with your iPhone 4's battery life? Does your phone drain quickly after a full charge, leaving you without any juice to finish your day? One possible culprit could be a faulty charge circuit, which can significantly reduce the battery's lifespan.

Luckily, there's a solution that you might not have heard of yet. It's called the iPhone 4 charge circuit repair kit, and it's an easy and affordable way to restore your phone's charging function to its original glory.

## What is a charge circuit, and why does it matter?

The charge circuit is responsible for charging your iPhone's battery when it's connected to a power source. It regulates the amount of energy that flows into the battery and ensures that it's not overcharged or undercharged, which can damage the battery's cells.

A malfunctioning charge circuit can cause several issues, including slow charging, sudden battery drain, and even a dead battery that won't stay charged. If you've tried all the common solutions like changing the charging cable, adaptor, or resetting the phone, it's time to check the charge circuit.

## Why choose a repair kit over a replacement?

If you've taken your phone to an Apple store or authorized repair center, they might recommend replacing the charge circuit altogether. It can be a costly and time-consuming process that involves opening up the phone and replacing the component.

On the other hand, a charge circuit repair kit is a more affordable and straightforward solution that anyone can do at home. The kit includes all the necessary tools and parts to repair the circuit without requiring any complex technical skills.

## How does the repair kit work?

The iPhone 4 charge circuit repair kit includes a replacement flex cable that connects the charging port to the motherboard. A damaged or worn-out flex cable can cause the charging function to fail, and the kit provides a new cable that can restore it.

To install the kit, you need to open up your phone and disconnect the old flex cable from the motherboard and the charging port. Then, you plug in the new cable following the manufacturer's instructions, reassemble the phone, and voila! Your iPhone 4 charge circuit is as good as new.

## Conclusion

Dealing with low battery life on your iPhone 4 can be frustrating, but a faulty charge circuit might be the cause. Instead of taking your phone to a repair center or replacing the circuit altogether, consider a charge circuit repair kit.

Not only is it a more affordable option, but it's also an excellent opportunity to learn some DIY skills and take control of your device's maintenance. Say goodbye to low battery woes and enjoy your phone's full functionality with an iPhone 4 charge circuit repair kit.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi
The iPhone charged at first, then one time after it draining completely I turned it on to find that it wouldn't charge, when plugged in the % would drop. To add to this when shut down it would now stay hot and drain.
I replaced the battery, dock connector and still no charging. Was going to get it sent off for a new power IC until I decided to open the motherboard up.
Under the metal casing I found a lot of green gunk/corrosion which I assume was from water damage.
This was located at the bottom near the antenna and blue capacitor but inside the charge circuits.
I cleaned this out with a toothbrush a alcohol, first it didn't help, but after leaving it soaked in alcohol for a bit and drying it it began to charge again!!
It now works, but charges incredibly slowly and is quite hot. Is there a way that I can make sure the corrosion doesn't come back and a way to hopefully speed up charging? It's all hardware related.
Many thanks.

 Leo, looks like you have at least one broken component. L9 looks cracked. That is 1.5UH-2A-126MOHM VLS252012-SM coil. The other bigger issues might be U11_RF which is a RF power regulator MAX8839L and is directly related to the charging circuit. You could check the components with a multimeter and see what you get. It also still looks like a bit of corrosion. you do want to remove those EMI shields and clean everything properly and double check that area for more missing, broken components. Hope this helps, good luck.

 heat = a short.
Phone is not going to work well with a short, and excess heat will damage other components.  You have to find and fix the short.
Which component is the source of the short?  The one that is the hottest.
One way to find it is to use your lips which are really sensitive.  Another way is to spray that part of the board with a freeze spray then see which component melts first.
In any event, you know you had/have corrosion.  Any component that is/was discolored or burned could be the culprit.  A component can look visually just fine, but not function electrically as designed.  Just like a loose lightbulb may light up for a few minutes in the right position, your phone temporarily was able to charge---you still need to screw that lightbulb in if you wanted to actually be able to use the device.
If you find the likely source of the short, you can remove that component and see if the heat goes away.  Replace it with a good one.
Of course this, like the battery connector repair, requires specialized skill in microsoldering.  You really wouldn't be able to achieve a successful result (in my opinion) without experience, a stereomicroscope, a 0.2mm variable temp soldering station, and the low melt solder that you said you didn't have ;)
But, everyone has to start somewhere---give it a try and let us know how it works out!
