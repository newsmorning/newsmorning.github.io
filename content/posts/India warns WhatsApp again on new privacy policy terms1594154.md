India, the world's second-most populated country, has taken a strong stance against WhatsApp's new privacy policy. The Indian government has made it clear that WhatsApp must comply with the country's laws and regulations, or face the consequences. In a letter to WhatsApp, the Indian government warned that the messaging app's new privacy policy violates the Indian Constitution.

The letter, which was sent by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), states that WhatsApp's new privacy policy "raises grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens." The Indian government has given WhatsApp seven days to respond to this letter or face legal action.

The Indian government's warning comes after WhatsApp announced changes to its privacy policy, which would allow the Facebook-owned company to share data with its parent company. WhatsApp users were initially given until February 8th to accept the new policy, after which the app would stop working. But due to widespread backlash and confusion, WhatsApp has since delayed the implementation of its new privacy policy until May 15.

India is WhatsApp's biggest market, with over 400 million users. Many Indians have turned to WhatsApp to communicate during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the app has played a crucial role in disseminating information and fighting fake news. However, concerns have been raised about how WhatsApp's new privacy policy could affect users' privacy and freedom of choice.

The Indian government's warning to WhatsApp is just the latest in a series of clashes between the government and tech companies over data privacy. The Indian government has been pushing for greater data localization, which would require companies to store data locally instead of in other countries. WhatsApp has refused to comply with this demand, arguing that it would be technically impossible to do so without compromising users' privacy and security.

WhatsApp's new privacy policy has also faced criticism from around the world. The European Union has launched a probe into the policy, with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) expressing concerns about how WhatsApp will obtain and process users' consent.

In conclusion, India's warning to WhatsApp about its new privacy policy is a significant development in the ongoing debate over data privacy and the role of tech companies in society. The Indian government's move highlights the importance of protecting citizens' privacy and autonomy, and how tech companies must comply with the laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate. WhatsApp's response to the Indian government's warning will be closely watched, as it could have significant implications for the future of data privacy and regulation.

Following the announcement about the new privacy policy terms made public by WhatsApp, the Indian government has issued a serious warning for the Facebook owned company.
 
- The Indian government expresses concerns against new privacy terms by WhatsApp.New Delhi officials state that WhatsApp has seven days to offer a satisfactory response.If the two parties will not reach an agreement, India is ready to take legal action.This is the company's second warning this year in regards to this sensitive matter.

 
Indian officials made it extremely clear that the terms of compliance must be met within seven days, otherwise, they would pursue legal alternatives.
 
## WhatsApp faces legal backlash from India’s government 
 
According to a post on Twitter, The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), from India, is not at all pleased that WhatsApp would try to enforce these privacy terms on its population.
 
By agreeing to these terms, users grant WhatsApp the consent to share personal information, such as their phone number and location, with Facebook.
 
Even though WhatsApp stated that information exchange between the two companies remains just as private as before, New Delhi officials are not at all pleased and will stand their ground.
 
Also, major figures within the government are still wondering why the Indian users are supposed to agree to such terms when the ones in Europe are not.
 
In fulfillment of its sovereign responsibility to protect the rights and interests of Indian citizens, the government of India will consider various options available to it under laws in India.
 
### This is WhatsApp’s second warning
 
Earlier this year, the Indian government issued another warning towards WhatsApp, addressing the same problem with the privacy policy terms.
 
The Asian country expressed grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens.
 
Because of these complications, WhatsApp had to pushback the imposition of these privacy updates by three months, until May 15. 
 
And although many of the users who were prompted to accept these new terms already agreed with doing it, those running the country are not happy.
 
This could be a big blow for WhatsApp, if the two parties do not reach common ground, as India is WhatsApp’s biggest market by users, with over 450 million active users.
