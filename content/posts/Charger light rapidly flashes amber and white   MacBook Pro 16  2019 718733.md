## You Won't Believe What Your Macbook Pro Charger is Telling You with Its Rapid, Flashing Lights - Get the Scoop Now!

If you are a MacBook Pro user, you might have noticed that the charger comes with a set of LED lights. These lights indicate the charging status and notify you when there is an issue with the charging process. But have you ever wondered what those rapid, flashing lights mean? In this article, we will explain everything you need to know about your MacBook Pro charger and its LED lights.

### Understanding the LED lights on your MacBook Pro charger

The LED lights on your MacBook Pro charger are not just random lights. Each light serves a specific purpose and provides you with vital information about your charger's performance. There are three main LED lights on your MacBook Pro charger that indicate different charging states.

**1. Amber LED light**

When you plug in your charger, you might notice an amber LED light. This light indicates that your MacBook is charging and that the battery is below 100%. The charger will continue to provide power to your MacBook until the battery is fully charged, at which point the LED light will turn green.

**2. Green LED light**

A green LED light means that your MacBook is fully charged, and the charger is providing power to maintain the battery level. You can unplug the charger and use your MacBook without any issues.

**3. Blinking LED light**

If you see a blinking LED light, your MacBook is not charging correctly, and the charger has entered a fault state. This could be due to a faulty charger, a damaged battery, or an issue with the charging port. In this case, you should unplug the charger and check for any damage or loose connections. If the problem persists, you might need to get your MacBook checked by an expert.
