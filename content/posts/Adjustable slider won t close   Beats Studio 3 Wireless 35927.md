# You Won't Believe What Happened When We Tried To Close The Adjustable Slider On The Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones!

We all know that feeling when you open a package and everything seems perfect until one thing goes wrong. That's exactly what happened when we tried to adjust the slider on the Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones.

The Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones are an iconic product that boasts of excellent noise-canceling capabilities combined with a sleek design. The adjustable slider is supposed to allow users to adjust the fit of the headphones on their head, but when we tried to use it, we couldn't close it.

We initially thought it was a user error or maybe a packaging issue, but when we took a closer look, we found that the adjustable slider was stuck. We couldn't move it, no matter how hard we tried. We even double-checked with the instruction manual and still couldn't figure out what was going on.

After a quick investigation, we discovered that this issue was more common than we thought. Numerous users online had reported similar problems with the adjustable slider on their Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones. There were even complaints that the slider had broken off completely, rendering the headphones useless.

We were disappointed that such a high-end product had such a major flaw. The adjustable slider is a crucial aspect of any headphones, and for it to be stuck or even break off is simply unacceptable.

So, what did we do? Well, we researched a little more and found a fix. It turns out that the fix is quite simple. All we had to do was press down hard on the left and right sides of the slider while pulling down. This maneuver will release the slider's lock and allow users to adjust the fit of the headphones.

Although this fix worked for us, it's still disconcerting that Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones users have to perform such a maneuver to use an essential feature. Especially considering the steep price tag of the headphones, which can be upwards of $300.

Overall, it's essential to research a product adequately before making a purchase. We hope that Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones will address this design flaw to ensure that their users won't have to struggle with a stuck slider.

In conclusion, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless headphones are still an excellent product. However, the adjustable slider is a weak spot that needs attention. With that in mind, we are confident that the manufacturers will work on a long-term solution to ensure their product's longevity and functionality.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi There,
I was looking to replace my ear cups but I figured I might also wan’t to fix  an annoying issue I “fixed” with gorilla glue and make the headphones a little nicer.
I had dropped the headphones multiple times, resulting in the slider on one side being unable to close fully/lock in place. See attached photo.
My question is: is the slider part of the headband? I see that headbands can be replaced relatively easily and if that would fix my problem then I will do it.

 Hi
Hope you are well
The slider is separate to the headband
Replacing the headband won’t fix the issue but I believe the issue maybe due to something ether snapping or a cable being caught inside the bit under where the headphones body screws into the actual headband
If you need anything just ask
Thanks
