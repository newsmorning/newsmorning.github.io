# OMG, You Won't Believe What Happened to My iPad 6 - Home Button Fails After Screen Replacement!

I recently had to replace the screen on my iPad 6, which had suffered a significant crack after I accidentally dropped it on the ground. I found a reputable repair shop and left my device in their capable hands, hoping that they would do an excellent job of restoring it to its former glory.

However, a few days after the repair, I noticed that something was off with my home button. It stopped working entirely, and I couldn't get back to my home screen no matter how many times I pressed it. Frustrated, I took it back to the repair shop to see what had gone wrong.

Upon inspection, the technician explained to me that the home button on the iPad 6 is connected to the screen cable and that it was a common problem during screen replacements. While repairing the cracked screen, the cable connecting the home button to the screen was accidentally severed, causing the button to stop working correctly.

I was completely shocked. I had no idea that replacing a broken screen could cause another significant problem on my device. I asked the technician if there was any hope of fixing it, and he explained that it would be a costly repair that involved replacing both the screen and the home button. Alternatively, I could opt to use the on-screen home button or invest in an external Bluetooth keyboard that has a home button feature.

I was grateful for the technician's honesty and expertise, but I was still disappointed with the outcome. I realized that sometimes, accidents do happen, and there are risks that come with repairing a broken electronic device. It's essential to choose a reputable repair shop that offers a warranty or guarantee for their services to ensure that you're protected in case anything goes wrong.

In hindsight, I wish I had done more research before taking my iPad 6 to the repair shop. I could have avoided this problem by choosing a repair shop that specializes in iPad repairs and has a good reputation for handling screen replacements. I learned a valuable lesson, and I hope that sharing my experience will help others make more informed decisions when it comes to repairing their devices.

In conclusion, though my iPad 6 home button fails after screen replacement, it taught me that repairing electronic devices is more complicated than it seems. Despite the unfortunate outcome, I'm grateful for the experience and am now more careful and diligent in choosing the right repair shop for my devices. I hope that this serves as a cautionary tale for others, so they won't have to experience the same disappointment that I did.

## Chosen Solution
 I have been repairing electronics for years. Never had any issues with iPads until recently, home buttons stop working after digitizer replacement. There is no damage to the home button or the cable or anywhere. Anyone else having this problem?
Or have found a solution?

 It could just be an alignment issue, is the metal part of the home button bracket (which is the contact for the button) aligned with the center receiver of the home button?

 Look at the back of the home button.  There should be a tiny black dot in the center of the switch.  If all you see is amber that dot has fallen of and the switch will not work when installed.
