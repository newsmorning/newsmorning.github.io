The story goes like this - a regular guy, let's call him John, was working on his iMac when he realized that the hard drive was not functioning properly. He knew that taking it to a repair shop would cost a lot of money and time. So, he decided to research and try replacing the hard drive himself.

John started by watching online tutorials and reading articles on how to replace an iMac HD. He bought the necessary tools and followed the instructions carefully. With some effort, he was able to remove the old hard drive and replace it with a new one. He then installed the operating system and backed up his data, and voila! The iMac was as good as new.

## Chosen Solution
 Here is the deal: I own an old IMAC EMC 2210, which except for some ghost stripes in the screen, works just fine for my purposes.
I have inherited an IMAC EMC 2389 from a friend with the only caveat that: HE NEEDS THE HD OF THE 2389 BACK, Safe for that part, I can keep the computer.
Question: (i) can I replace the HD on the 2389 for the HD of my 2210 (therefore, returning the HD to my friend and running the 2389 with the HD of my old 2210)? Would it work?; (ii) can I migrate hardware parts of the 2210 into the 2389 to make it work?
Greatly appreaciate the inputs from the experts.

Alright, so it looks like the  Display Port Connector  was damaged when I opened the case. As a matter of fact, it came out without me touching it.
Can I replace it?

 Both are 3.5” SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) drives and are physically the same! So in its self thats not hard!
Here’s the guides you’ll need to follow:
iMac Intel 20" EMC 2133 and 2210 Hard Drive ReplacementiMac Intel 21.5" EMC 2389 Hard Drive Replacement
But we do have a small issue! The EMC 2389 system uses a different arrangement for the system thermal monitoring  sensor. Your EMC 2210 system uses a stuck on sensor which you can see on Step 20 unlike the EMC 2389 which uses the internal sensor within the drive its self. You’ll need this: OWC In-line Digital Thermal Sensor for iMac Late 2009 - Mid 2010 Hard Drive Upgrade.
Do consider getting a new drive instead! Your drive is quite old and may not last much longer and is likely quite small too.  While you’ll still need the OWC sensor you might find getting a bigger and faster drive which are not that costly a smart move here.
As you have a SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) system you do need to make sure the drive you get is able to run at this I/O speed. Many drives today are fixed speed SATA III (6.0 Gb/s) Here’s the best drive you can get Seagate FireCuda
