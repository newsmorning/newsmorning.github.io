This year’s CES in Las Vegas saw a lot of amazing innovations and announcements, but most of them weren’t budget friendly. So Dell decided to make an exception, as the company unveiled a new, affordable Windows 10 laptop.
 
Dell’s newest entry was announced at the Pepcom Digital Experience trade show, and it is the new member of Inspiron 11 3000 laptop line, which costs only $199. The 2016 version of Dell 11 3000 is less powerful than its predecessor, as the touchscreen has been removed, and it’s not a 2-in-1 device anymore, also the previous version was powered by an Intel Core i3 processor, which is no longer the case. But, it’s pretty clear what Dell wanted to achieve with this laptop – a lower price!
 
And Dell Inspiron 11 3000 is indeed a good value for the money. It features a 11.6-inch display, with a resolution of 1,366 x 768. There’s a 2GB of RAM memory, and a 32GB SSD. The device is powered by Intel Celeron processor. Probably the best part of the deal is exceptionally well designed keyboard, which feels well to work with.
 
The laptop is offered in three colors: red, blue, and white, so you can choose the right design, to match your style.
 
With these specifications this laptop can pretty much be used only for browsing and instant messaging, but you can’t really expect anything better from a $200 laptop. But there are a lot of people don’t need more to get their work done.
 
Some people call this device a “Windows 10 Chromebook,” and Dell also claims that the new laptop is for “people who carry their systems with them like an extension of their phone.”
