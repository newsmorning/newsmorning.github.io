Title: Why Your Airport Extreme A1521 is Flashing Orange - No Wifi or Cable Connection!

If you own an Airport Extreme A1521, you might have encountered a problem where the device starts flashing orange, indicating that there is no wifi or cable connection. This issue is quite frustrating as it disrupts your internet connectivity and can result in lost work or missed deadlines. But what is causing your Airport Extreme to malfunction?

After analyzing several cases and conducting research on this issue, we have come to the conclusion that the most common reason for a flashing orange light on your Airport Extreme A1521 is a firmware update failure. The firmware is an essential software that connects the Airport Extreme to the internet and allows it to function. If the firmware update process fails, the Airport Extreme stops functioning, and the orange light starts flashing.

Step 3: While holding the reset button, plug in the power cable to the Airport Extreme.

Step 4: Continue holding the reset button for another 5 to 10 seconds until the light on the device starts flashing rapidly.

Step 5: Release the reset button.

Your Airport Extreme A1521 has now been reset to its factory settings.

The next step is to set up your Airport Extreme from scratch. Connect your device to your modem or internet service provider's cable and follow the steps in the setup assistant to create a new network.

In conclusion, if you face an issue with the flashing orange light on your Airport Extreme A1521, don't panic. This problem is quite common, and it can be resolved easily by resetting your device to its factory settings.

## Chosen Solution
 hey experts … I have a riddle here … I have Airport Extreme blinking orange (amber) with no other light (lan sockets), no wifi and no connection via cable. Tried to reset it - no luck so far, tried different power boards - same behavior - so I think the power, fan is OK, but why orange is still blinking and no other sign of life is there … even fan was cleaned but does not spin … tried new fan as well but not spinning as well … any advice what I could try ? I know it’s old but I like fixing things … thanks in advance !

 The blinking LED is telling you its trying to update its firmware. Using the uplink Ethernet port connect it to your Internet router so it can finish.
You should also plug in your Mac system into the same hub as your AirPort and use the AirPort app to check on your Airport unit.
