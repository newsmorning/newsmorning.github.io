If you are an iPhone SE 2020 user, you might have experienced the frustrating moment when your home button stops working. This issue can be inconvenient and annoying, especially if you rely heavily on your iPhone for everyday tasks. In this article, we will explore the shocking reason why your iPhone SE 2020 home button stopped working and what you can do to fix it.

The home button on your iPhone SE 2020 is essential for navigation, allowing you to return to the home screen or activate Siri. The button is connected to the device's logic board using two thin cables. These cables can become damaged or disconnected, which can cause the home button to stop working. This issue can also be caused by water damage or physical damage to the device.

However, the shocking reason why your iPhone SE 2020 home button stopped working might be due to a software glitch. Apple's latest iOS updates have caused some users to experience issues with their home button. The iOS software has a feature called AssistiveTouch, which adds a virtual home button to your device's screen. This feature is especially helpful for users with physical disabilities or those who have trouble pressing the home button.

If the AssistiveTouch feature is turned on, it can cause the physical home button to stop working, leading to a non-functional home button. This issue can be resolved by turning off the AssistiveTouch feature or resetting your device's software. To turn off the AssistiveTouch feature, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch, and toggle the feature off. If this doesn't work, try resetting your device by holding down the power and home buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo appears.

In some cases, the issue might be persistent, and your iPhone SE 2020 home button might still not work. If this is the case, you might need to take your device to an Apple Authorized Service Provider to get it fixed. Apple Authorized Service Providers can diagnose and repair any hardware or software issues with your iPhone SE 2020, including a non-functional home button.

In conclusion, if you have an iPhone SE 2020, and your home button stops working, don't panic. The reason behind this issue might be shocking, but it is fixable. Try turning off the AssistiveTouch feature, resetting your device's software, or taking it to an Apple Authorized Service Provider for repair. With a functioning home button, your iPhone SE 2020 will be back to its optimum performance, and you can continue to enjoy the convenience and ease of use that Apple devices are known for.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi! I fell into some water with my iPhone SE 2020 in hand. After first getting a message that the iPhone couldn’t charge due to water damage (so I unplugged the charger), a day later I can apparently safely charge it (the message doesn’t pop up anymore), but now my home button isn’t working anymore. I got a message that there was a problem with it, and iOS put a virtual home button on the screen. After restarting, the virtual home button is gone, as is the message, but the button still doesn’t work. It works for Touch ID and I can feel haptic feedback (is that what it’s called? I can feel the short vibrations under the home button), but the button itself is not clickable. Is there something I can do about this? I don’t think Apple will likely repair this? I do have some minor experience repairing my older iPhones, but since Touch ID came out I haven’t replaced a home button since I think this can’t be replaced?
Thank you for your help!

 You can replace home button if you are willing to give up touch ID, however it is possible that the button is dirty and/or was shorted by the contact with water, try cleaning it with a 90% isopropyl alcohol and a dry, soft cloth. another option is a third-party software you can use for you to try on fixing your unresponsive home button such as FoneDog iOS System Recovery. This may fix the issue.
Hope This Helps :)
