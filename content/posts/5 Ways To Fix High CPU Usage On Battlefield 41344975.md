# Boost Your FPS Today - 5 Simple Tips to Fix High Cpu Usage on Battlefield 4!

Battlefield 4 is one of the most popular first-person shooter games available on the market today. However, playing the game with high CPU usage can result in poor performance and reduced FPS. Fortunately, fixing high CPU usage issues is relatively simple. In this article, we will share 5 easy tips to boost your FPS in Battlefield 4 by reducing high CPU usage.

## Tip 1: Close Unnecessary Programs

One of the primary reasons for high CPU usage in Battlefield 4 is running additional programs in the background. These programs consume additional CPU resources, resulting in reduced performance. Therefore, it is essential to close any unnecessary programs such as Spotify, web browsers, and any other applications that are not essential while gaming.

## Tip 2: Disable Unnecessary Background Services

In addition to closing unnecessary programs, you can also disable unnecessary background services. Many services run automatically in the background, even if you are not using them, consuming additional resources. For instance, you can disable the Windows Search service, which continually indexes your files and documents, resulting in high CPU usage. To disable services, type "Services" in the Windows Search bar and disable any unwanted services.

## Tip 3: Check for Viruses and Malware

Viruses and malware can cause high CPU usage, resulting in slow gaming performance. Therefore, it is essential to run regular virus scans to identify and remove such threats. You can use a reliable antivirus program such as AVG or Avast to scan your system for viruses and malware.

## Tip 4: Reduce Graphics Settings

High graphics settings can also lead to high CPU usage in Battlefield 4. Therefore, reducing your graphics settings can help reduce your CPU usage, thus improving your FPS. You can reduce settings such as shadows, anti-aliasing, and reflections.

## Tip 5: Overclocking Your CPU

Overclocking is the process of increasing the clock speed of your CPU, which can improve performance. If you have a CPU that is capable of overclocking, you can increase the clock speed to reduce high CPU usage in Battlefield 4.

In conclusion, by following these 5 tips, you can easily and quickly fix high CPU usage issues in Battlefield 4 and boost your FPS, ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience. So what are you waiting for? Apply these tips today and start gaming with smooth and consistent performance!
