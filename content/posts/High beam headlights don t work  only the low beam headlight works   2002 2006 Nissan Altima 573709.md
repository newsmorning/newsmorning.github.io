# Is Your Nissan Altima in the Dark? Find Out Why High Beam Headlights Are Failing While Low Beams Shine Bright!

## Introduction

Nissan Altima is a mid-size car that has been manufactured by Japanese automaker Nissan since 1992. It is known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. However, many Nissan Altima owners have been facing a common issue lately - the high beam headlights are failing while low beams shine bright. This issue has left many Nissan Altima drivers in the dark, quite literally. In this article, we will explore what may be causing this problem and what you can do to fix it.

## Common Causes

There can be several reasons why the high beams on your Nissan Altima are not working while the low beams are. Let's take a look at some of the most common causes -

### Burnt Out Bulbs

The most common reason for high beams failing is burnt-out bulbs. If the headlight bulb has reached the end of its lifespan, it won't work properly. A burnt-out bulb can be easily identified as it won't light up, and the filament inside the bulb may look broken or damaged.

### Failing Relay

A faulty relay in your Altima's headlight system can also cause high beam failure while low beams work perfectly fine. A relay is a small electronic component that controls the electrical current in the car's headlight system. When a relay fails, it can cause the high beams to stop working or not work at all.

### Faulty Switch

If the high beams on your Nissan Altima are not working, the switch that controls them could be faulty. The switch could be broken, or a connection may be loose, preventing it from activating the high beam headlights.

### Wiring Issues

Another possible cause of high beams failing on your Nissan Altima could be faulty wiring in the headlight system. Damaged or corroded wires can interfere with the electrical current and cause the high beams to fail.

## What Can You Do?

If your Nissan Altima's high beams are not working while the low beams are shining bright, there is no need to worry. Solutions to the problem will depend on the underlying cause of the issue. Here are some of the things that you can do -

### Replace the Bulbs

If the high beam headlights on your Nissan Altima are burnt out, replacing the bulbs is the easiest fix. Ensure that you replace both headlight bulbs at the same time as they tend to have a similar lifespan.

### Check the Relays

If a faulty relay is to blame for your Altima's high beams not working, you may need to replace the relay to fix the issue. Relays are often cheap and easily accessible, so this should not be a challenging task.

### Test the Switch

If you think the switch may be causing the high beams to fail, you can test its functionality using a multimeter. If the switch is indeed faulty, you should consider replacing it.

### Check the Wiring

If the problem lies with the wiring in the headlight system, it is best to consult with an auto-electrician to diagnose and fix the problem. Damaged wires can be a little more complicated to fix yourself.

## Conclusion

Driving a Nissan Altima without properly functioning headlights can be dangerous. It is essential to diagnose and fix the issue promptly. In this article, we have explored the common causes of high beam failure in Nissan Altima's and what you can do to fix them. Remember, if you are not comfortable performing any of the suggested repairs, it is always best to consult with a qualified professional to avoid causing further damage to your vehicle.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a 2005 Altima in Canada with a Running Lights Module. Checked the fuses but the High beams don’t seem to work, and only the low beams seem to work.

 @raezorsharp check the headlamp high relay, located in the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room).
“High Beam Operation/Flash-to-Pass Operation
With the lighting switch in 2ND position and placed in HIGH or PASS position, the BCM (body control module)  receives input requesting the headlamp high beams to illuminate. This input is communicated to the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room) across the CAN communication lines. The central processing unit of the IPDM E/R controls the headlamp high relay coil. When energized, this relay directs power
to 10A fuse [No. 47, located in the IPDM]through terminal 24 of the IPDM
*  to terminal 1 of headlamp RH, and
to 10A fuse [No. 48, located in the IPDM]through terminal 22 of the IPDMto terminal 1 of headlamp LH.
Ground is supplied
to terminal 2 of headlamp RHthrough body grounds E15 and E24, andto terminal 2 of headlamp LHthrough body grounds E15 and E24.
With power and ground supplied, the high beam headlamps and the HIGH BEAM indicator illuminate.
