 Hi,
In your replacement guide I see no link to purchasing a mid-2010 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 board.
I believe it was a new spec at the time.
You reference a 2009 board, but is that the same?
Thanks

 Think I found it:
MacBook Pro 15" Unibody (Mid 2010) 2.66 GHz Logic Board
Am I correct?

 DO NOT buy 820-2850 boards of any kind, they all wind up kernel panicing for no reason. Apple hasn't even figured this out yet. At least 2011 820-2915 boards work after replacing the GPU, 820-2850 just belong in a furnace.
