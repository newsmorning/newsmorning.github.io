# Revive Your Old iPhone 6S with a Brand New Motherboard Block - Unleash the Power of iPhone 6s Today!

If you are one of those who still swear by the iPhone 6S, even after years of usage, then you might have noticed some slowdowns and sluggishness in your device's performance. But what if we told you that you can make your old iPhone 6S as powerful as the latest iPhone model by just replacing its motherboard block? Yes, it's possible, and in this article, we'll tell you why and how.

## Why Replace the Motherboard Block?

The motherboard is like the heart of your iPhone, and it's responsible for all the vital functions of your device. It connects all the other components, processes the data and power, and regulates everything.

With the passage of time, the motherboard gets old, and some of its components may stop working as efficiently as they should. When this happens, it affects the overall performance of your iPhone, and you may experience lags, slow app loading times, and even crashes.

Moreover, the software updates and new features released by Apple require more processing power and memory storage, which the old motherboard block may not be able to handle.

That's why replacing your old iPhone 6S motherboard block with a brand new one can unleash its full potential and provide you with a smooth, fast, and reliable user experience.

## What's the Benefit of Upgrading the Motherboard Block?

Upgrading the motherboard block of your iPhone 6s has several benefits, including:

- **Improved Performance:** The new motherboard block is a more powerful and efficient processor that can handle the latest iOS updates and apps smoothly and quickly.

- **More Storage Space:** The new motherboard block comes with upgraded memory storage, allowing you to store more photos, videos, and other files without worrying about running out of space.

- **Better Camera Performance:** The new iPhone 6s motherboard block allows you to take more detailed and high-quality pictures and videos, thanks to its improved camera processing capabilities.

- **Longer Battery Life:** The new motherboard block is more energy-efficient and can extend your iPhone 6s's battery life by a few hours.

- **Cost-effective:** Upgrading the motherboard block of your iPhone 6s costs less than buying a new iPhone, and it can significantly extend the life of your old device.

## How to Replace Your iPhone 6S Motherboard Block?

Replacing your old iPhone 6S motherboard block with a brand new one is a complex process that requires some technical skills and tools. Here are the main steps of the process:

1. **Backup Your Data:** Before you start, make sure you back up all your data to avoid losing it during the process.

2. **Disassemble Your iPhone:** Remove the screws, the display assembly, and other components until you reach the motherboard.

3. **Remove the Old Motherboard Block:** Disconnect all the cables and unscrew the motherboard block from the frame.

4. **Install the New Motherboard Block:** Follow the reverse process to install the new motherboard block, connect all the cables and components, and screw them back in place.

5. **Test and Activate:** After you reassemble the iPhone, turn it on, and test everything to make sure it's working correctly. Then activate your new motherboard block by logging into your Apple ID and restoring your data.

## Conclusion

If you want to extend the life of your old iPhone 6S and get the most out of it, consider replacing its motherboard block with a brand new one.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi everyone , I am currently using a iPhone 6 s . Recently having problem with its touchscreen , the lower bar of the screen is compleatly not working , and battery is down , show charging sign but doesn't change the percentage number with keep restarting .
On the other hand I have another iPhone 6 with network block so I can't use it .
To not that my faulty iPhone is 16 gb but the other one is 64 .
So is there any solution that I can change the motherboard of my block iPhone from my old one and use it ?

 Hi if you manage to do this you are a magician.. forget about this.
It would be easier to fix the original iphone 6s, test a new screen and battery would be a good start

 The components are not compatible between those models. I recommend a new screen and battery as first steps.
