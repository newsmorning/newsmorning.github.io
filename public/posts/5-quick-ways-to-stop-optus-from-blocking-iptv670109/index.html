Since its inception, IPTV has revolutionized the way we access and watch television. It delivers a wide range of TV channels, movies, and TV shows through the internet. IPTV has gained immense popularity among viewers worldwide. However, in Australia, certain ISPs like Optus have started to block IPTV services that stream channels illegally. But, as an IPTV streamer, there are quick and easy ways to get around Optus’s blocking. Here are five quick ways to unlock the ultimate IPTV hack!\nUse a VPN Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is one of the easiest ways to bypass Optus’s blocking. By using a VPN, you can access IPTV services that have been blocked by Optus. A VPN works by creating a secure and encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. It masks your IP address, which makes it difficult for Optus or any other ISP to track your online activities. When you connect to a VPN server, your internet traffic is routed through the server, making it appear as if it’s originating from a different location. This way, you can access IPTV services that are not available in your region.\nUse a Smart DNS A Smart DNS is another quick way to bypass Optus’s blocking. Unlike VPNs, Smart DNSs do not encrypt your internet traffic. Instead, they route your DNS queries through a proxy server located in a different location. This way, your IP address remains unchanged, and your internet speed remains unaffected. A Smart DNS is a cheaper alternative to a VPN and is suitable for IPTV streamers who are looking for a quick and easy way to bypass Optus’s blocking.\nUse a Proxy Server A proxy server acts as a middleman between your device and the internet. It intercepts all your internet traffic and forwards it to the internet on your behalf. When you connect to a proxy server, your IP address is replaced with the proxy server’s IP address. Optus and other ISPs cannot track your online activities because they only see the proxy server’s IP address. However, using a proxy server can slow down your internet speed, and some IPTV services may not work correctly with a proxy server.\nUse a Mirror Site A mirror site is a copy of an original website that is hosted on a different domain name or IP address. A mirror site is a quick and easy way to bypass Optus’s blocking. Instead of accessing the blocked IPTV service directly, you can access a mirror site that hosts the same content. However, using a mirror site can be risky since some mirror sites may contain malware or viruses.\nUse a Hybrid Solution A hybrid solution combines two or more of the above solutions to create a more effective way of bypassing Optus’s blocking. For example, you can use a VPN with a Smart DNS to create a more secure and faster way of accessing IPTV services. A hybrid solution is suitable for IPTV streamers who want to ensure maximum security and privacy while accessing IPTV services.\nIn conclusion, Optus’s blocking of IPTV services should not deter IPTV streamers from accessing their favorite channels and TV shows. There are quick and easy ways to bypass Optus’s blocking, such as using a VPN, Smart DNS, proxy server, mirror site, or a hybrid solution. Choose the solution that best fits your needs and start enjoying uninterrupted IPTV streaming today!\nIPTV presents some great TV shows that include sports, entertainment, etc. This is based on the Internet Protocol networks.\nNote that using a VPN might help in resolving this issue IPTV provides the best streaming service over the Internet Protocol networks where you can find many TV shows including Sports. Many IPTV users are unable to watch any shows because Optus is blocking IPTV. Checking for the subscription might resolve the issue and you’ll continue watching IPTV without getting blocked. These days, many IPTV users have reported that they are facing issues while streaming their favorite shows, especially sports.\nWhen users try to access any TV show, it simply denies them access and blocks IPTV.\nDoes Optus use PPPoE? Yes. Optus telecommunication service uses PPPoE authentication. You can enable it by logging in to your router and checking out your manual guide.\nBrowse the web from multiple devices with increased security protocols.\nAccess content across the globe at the highest speed rate.\nConnect to thousands of servers for persistent seamless browsing.\nThen, go to Internet Access on the homepage, select the PPPoE option, and then click Enable for your profile. Then, enter all the necessary details, like setting up the username and password Optus gave.\nOnce done, you are connected to the internet in a few minutes.\nThe five best possible ways to stop Optus from blocking IPTV are explained below.\nHow do I stop Optus from blocking IPTV? 1. Check if you are subscribed to IPTV IPTV services have premium content that needs to be subscribed to watch without a break. However, when this subscription expires or lapses, it might cause problems like the one mentioned above.\nSo, please go to your IPTV account and check if the subscription is still valid. Otherwise, renew it to continue watching the TV shows.\n2. Try installing the MyIPTV Player app Open the Microsoft Store app on the system by pressing the Windows key and typing Microsoft store. Click the Microsoft Store app from the results page. After the Microsoft Store app opens, type myiptv in the search bar on the top. Select the MyIPTV Player app from the suggested apps on the search results page. Click Get under the MyIPTV Player page. This starts downloading and then installing the application. After installation is done, open the MyIPTV Player app. Click Settings on the top menu and select Add new playlist and EPG source under the Manage playlist and EPG section. Enter the IPTV channel name in the Remote channel list Name textbox. Then provide the IPTV subscription link in the Remote channel list URL textbox. Finally, click Add remote list and start watching IPTV channels. 3. Use a VPN IPTV services restrict some countries because they are country-specific in displaying the content. For example, some TV shows can be watched only in the US; if a US resident moves to another country, he cannot watch it due to this problem.\nTherefore, using the best VPN might help in resolving this issue. The perfect VPN provider for this issue is ExpressVPN. It’s one of the most trusted VPSs on the market and it provides great threat protection.\nHere are some simple steps on how to use ExpressVPN:\nFirst, you have to download ExpressVPN from their official website. Then, run the setup to install it. After the installation, open the software. Now, select Choose Location to open the VPN Locations Search for the location you want or just select one from the Recommended tab and you are ready to go. Watch IPTV from any device with ExpressVPN, one of the most trusted VPN providers on the market. Not only does it focus on your security and privacy, but it also keeps you hidden while using this VPN.\n4. Try using a different browser If you are consistently getting blocked by the Optus service, you can always try using the Opera browser on the system. This browser has a built-in VPN which is free of cost.\nExpressVPN Enjoy IPTV and other streaming platforms without worrying about restricted content.\nYou must ensure the VPN settings are turned on in the Opera web browser. To do so, you need to click the toggle button of Enable VPN option on the Settings page of Opera.\nWithout this, it will be unable to stop any ISP from blocking the websites or IPTV.\n5. Use a VPN router When the IPTV device is connected to a standard router that does not have VPN software, it tends to create problems like blocking some websites or TV services like IPTV.\nTherefore, we suggest taking a VPN router and then connecting it to the IPTV device to start watching the TV shows without restrictions. You can also try installing the best available VPNs that could resolve this problem where IPTV gets blocked.\nHow do I check if my ISP is blocking streaming? The easiest way to check if your ISP is blocking streaming is by using the hide.me or whoever.net proxy server address and accessing the website or streaming service. If you can access it without issues, your ISP is blocking streaming.\nAnother way to check is by connecting your mobile network carrier to the system and trying to access the website. Here are some best TV recording software available for your Windows system. These can be helpful at times.\nDid you find this article informative?
