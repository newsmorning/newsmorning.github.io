Many property owners are unaware of how much money they could be saving by properly calculating and claiming building depreciation. In this article, we will explore the shocking truth about building depreciation and reveal some easy calculation tips to help you save thousands on your property taxes.\nWhat is Building Depreciation?\nDepreciation is the reduction in the value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or other factors. In the case of a building, depreciation applies to the value of the structure itself (not the land it sits on) and can be claimed as a tax deduction. Building depreciation is a non-cash expense that reduces the net income of a property and can save property owners significant amounts of money on their taxes.\nHow Does Building Depreciation Work?\nWhen a property owner purchases a commercial or residential building, the IRS allows them to deduct a portion of the building’s cost as a depreciation expense each year over a specified period. The length of time over which a building can be depreciated depends on its class (residential or commercial) and is generally 27.5 years for residential buildings and 39 years for commercial buildings.\nFor example, if you purchased a rental property for $500,000, and the cost of the building itself was $400,000, you could claim a depreciation expense of approximately $14,545 per year ($400,000 divided by 27.5 years).\nWhy is Building Depreciation So Important?\nBuilding depreciation can significantly reduce a property owner’s taxable income, which ultimately saves them money on their taxes. When you claim building depreciation, you are essentially reducing the amount of profit you make on your rental property, which means you pay less in taxes.\nIn addition to reducing your tax liability, building depreciation is a valuable tool when it comes time to sell your property. By depreciating your building over time, you are effectively reducing its value on paper. When you sell your property, you will pay less in capital gains taxes because the value of your building will be lower than what you sold it for.\nEasy Calculation Tips for Building Depreciation\nCalculating building depreciation can seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. Here are some easy calculation tips to help you get started:\nKnow the Cost of Your Building: To calculate your building’s depreciation, you need to know the cost of the building. This includes the purchase price, closing costs, and any improvements made to the building.\nUnderstand the Class of Your Building: Residential and commercial buildings have different depreciation schedules. Make sure you know the class of your building so you can properly calculate its depreciation.\nUse the Correct Depreciation Period: The length of time over which you can depreciate your building depends on its class. Use the correct depreciation period when calculating your depreciation expense.\nUse an Online Calculator: There are many online building depreciation calculators available that can help you easily calculate your depreciation expense.\nFinal Thoughts\nBuilding depreciation can save property owners significant amounts of money on their taxes each year. By properly calculating and claiming your building depreciation, you can reduce your tax liability and potentially save thousands of dollars. If you are a property owner or landlord, take advantage of this valuable tax deduction and start saving money today!\nWhat is the Depreciation of Building? The rate of depreciationRate Of DepreciationThe depreciation rate is the percent rate at which an asset depreciates during its estimated useful life.

Buildings used for residential purposes except for boarding houses and hotels fall in this category. A building is considered to be used for residential purposes only if more than 66.66% of the built-up floor area is used for residential purposes.10% Depreciation Rate: All other types that don’t fall under the category of residential premises are depreciated at the rate of 10% under the income tax act.100% Depreciation Rate: Buildings mainly used for installing machinery and plants that form part of the water treatment system and water supply project fall under this special category. Further, wooden structures and tin sheds also fall under this category as they are purely temporary erections. These are depreciated at a special rate of 100%.

Step 1: Firstly, determine the depreciable basis for the building under consideration. (Take the help of a qualified accountant or an external appraiser to ascertain the depreciable basis for the building.) If the property price is a combination of both buildings and land, then it can be derived by deducting the purchase consideration of the land from the overall amount paid, as shown below. Also, you can deduct the building’s salvage value (if available) for a precise valuation.\nStep 2: Next, determine the depreciation rate category based on the property’s nature. It would be either 5%, 10%, or 100%, which would be used to calculate the annual depreciation of the building. The depreciation rate can also be calculated as the reciprocal of the useful lifeUseful LifeUseful life is the estimated time period for which the asset is expected to be functional and can be put to use for the company’s core operations. It serves as an important input for calculating depreciation for assets which affects the profitability and carrying value of the assets.read more of the asset.\nStep 3: Next, multiply the rate of depreciation and the depreciable basis for the building to derive the annual depreciation of the building, as shown below.\nStep 4: Finally, capture the annual depreciation in the income statement to calculate EBITCalculate EBITEBIT is a profitability tool used to measure the operating Profits of a Company.

For example, if a company’s machinery has a 5-year life and is only valued $5000 at the end of that time, the salvage value is $5000.read more of $8,000. Determine the annual depreciation of the building if the applicable rate of depreciation is 10%.\nSolution:\nGiven,\nPurchase price = $100,000Salvage value = $8,000Rate of depreciation = 5% Now, the depreciable basis of the building can be calculated as,\nDepreciable Basis = $100,000 – $8,000 = $92,000\nNow, the calculation will be –\n= $92,000 * 10% = $9,200\nExample #2 Let us take the example of a building bought by XDE Inc. to illustrate the concept of depreciation. The property was bought for $300,000, including the purchase price of the land, which is $100,000. The building is estimated to have a useful life of 20 years, and at the end of the 20 years, the building is expected to have a salvage value of $10,000. Determine the annual depreciation of the building based on the given information.\nOverall combined price = $300,000Purchase consideration of land = $100,000Salvage value of building = $10,000Useful life = 20 years Now, the rate of depreciation can be calculated as,\nRate of depreciation = 1 / 20 = 5%\nThe depreciable = $300,000 – $100,000 – $10,000 = $190,000\nNow, calculation will be –\n=$190,000 * 5% = $9,500\nEffects on the Financial Statements DebitDebitDebit represents either an increase in a company’s expenses or a decline in its revenue. read more to depreciation expense results in a reduction of the net income, which eventually results in lower retained earningsRetained EarningsRetained Earnings are defined as the cumulative earnings earned by the company till the date after adjusting for the distribution of the dividend or the other distributions to the investors of the company.
