As a freelance writer who relies heavily on technology to work, I was devastated when my Acer G9 793 78Cm laptop suddenly refused to start. I had been using it just the night before, and there were no signs of trouble. However, when I tried turning it on the next day, nothing happened. No power, no noise, nothing.

At first, I thought the battery might be dead. I plugged in the charger and waited for a while, but nothing seemed to happen. I tried a different power outlet, but still no luck. I even tried removing the battery and holding down the power button for a few seconds before reinserting it. However, none of these methods worked.

I decided to take it to a repair shop that specialized in laptops. The technician there was able to diagnose the problem quickly. Apparently, there was an issue with the motherboard. He explained that this was a common problem with this particular model of Acer laptop, and that he had seen it many times before.

He told me that the only solution was to replace the motherboard, but that it would be expensive. I was frustrated and didn't want to spend more money on an already expensive laptop. I decided to do some research online to see if there were other solutions.

After some searching, I discovered that some users had experienced similar problems with their Acer laptops and had managed to solve them using a process called reflowing. Reflowing involves heating the motherboard to a high temperature to melt the solder and fix any broken connections.

I decided to give it a try, even though it sounded risky. I followed the step-by-step instructions I found online, and after a few long hours, I managed to reflow the motherboard successfully. To my surprise, the laptop turned on without any problems.

I was ecstatic that I had managed to fix my Acer laptop without having to replace the motherboard, which would have cost me a lot of money. However, I realize that not everyone feels comfortable attempting such a repair and it would be best to take it to a professional.

I learned my lesson that day. It's always important to back up important work on an external drive as you never know when your laptop will give up on you. I'm also more careful now about not overworking my laptop, which can lead to overheating and damages to the motherboard.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing similar problems with your Acer laptop, it's important to seek professional help or do plenty of research before attempting any repairs. However, if you're feeling brave and up for a challenge, reflowing the motherboard might just be the solution you're looking for.

## Chosen Solution
 My Acer Predator G9-793-78CM laptop won't start.  The battery has been slowly wearing out but I didn't think that would cause it not to start at all when plugged in.  The battery indicator light is red when plugged in.  Do I need to replace my battery, the charger, both or something else entirely?  Thanks in advance for any assistance.

 Remove the battery completely from the device. Unplug it, hold down the power button for 60 seconds. Then, plug it back in (without the battery) and try to power it on. If nothing, try again with the battery inserted again.
