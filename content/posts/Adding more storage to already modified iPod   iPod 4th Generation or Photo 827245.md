## Chosen Solution
 I need some help.  About 6 months ago, I had modified an iPod Classic (4th gen) from 60 GB to 128GB using two 64GB microSD cards and iFlash Dual.
I running out of space, so I tried to increase the storage to 320GB (a new 256GB + one of the existing 64GB cards).  So, I replaced the 64-GB card on slot 1 with the 256GB card.  When I turned the iPod ON, it showed me a warning -  exclamation mark with folder icon.  When I connected iPod to iTunes (on iMac), it was not recognized.
1.  Why did I get the error and how do I resolve it?
2.  Do I need to format the new card?
3.  It is good assumption that the OS was on the card in the first slot?
Your insight will help a lot.
Thanks.

 You need to restore the iPod using iTunes.
