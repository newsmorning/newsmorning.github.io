Do you believe that having the latest MacBook Pro 15 is necessary to keep up with the times and perform your daily tasks efficiently? If so, it’s time to face the truth: upgrading your MacBook Pro 15 may not be as beneficial as you think.\nThe shocking reality is that many MacBook Pro 15 users are throwing their hard-earned money away on unnecessary upgrades. In fact, most of the latest MacBook Pro 15 models have minor changes that do not justify the hefty price tag.\nThe latest MacBook Pro 15 models have minor, iterative changes in terms of hardware, making them more or less identical to the previous models. Upgrading to the latest MacBook Pro 15 model just for a slight update in the processor or graphics card is not worth the cost, especially considering that the previous model is still more than capable of handling everyday tasks.\nMoreover, upgrading your MacBook Pro 15 could mean spending an enormous amount of money that could be better spent elsewhere.

This is a significant amount of money that could be used for other important expenses, such as savings or investments.\nIf you do need to upgrade your MacBook Pro 15, consider making minor upgrades instead of purchasing a brand new one. Simple upgrades like adding a Solid State Drive (SSD) or increasing the RAM can significantly improve your MacBook Pro 15’s performance without breaking the bank.\nIt’s also important to note that constantly upgrading your MacBook Pro 15 could lead to faster depreciation of the device’s value. The latest models are not always the best, and sometimes a device that is two or three years old and still in good condition can be worth keeping.\nIn conclusion, upgrading your MacBook Pro 15 may not be as necessary as you think. Minor upgrades can improve your device’s performance, and there’s no need to splurge on the latest and greatest model unless there are significant upgrades that justify the cost. Remember, a MacBook Pro 15 that is a few years old and still in good condition can be worth keeping, and constantly upgrading devices could lead to faster depreciation. So, before you shell out a significant amount of money on a new MacBook Pro 15, consider whether the upgrade is truly necessary or just a want.\nChosen Solution Sorry if this is a stupid question. It’s finally time to upgrade out of my 2014 Macbook Air. I’d like to stay within Apple’s products if possible but most of their products are basically impossible to replace/repair/upgrade. I’m looking at a Mid 2012 Unibody Pro since its guts can actually be swapped out, which brings me to the question: just how much can I switch out? If I’m looking to change out the processor and graphics card, upgrade the RAM, and switch the HDD to a SSD will I end up with a computer that runs well and is comparable to more recent models, or a mess of components that can’t work together or, if it does work, can’t compare to newer models? I’d consider myself moderate-beginner in experience, I’ve repaired and upgraded other electronics but this would be my first big project. I’m debating between this project and buying a Framework or Dell and going the Hackintosh route.\nRAM and a SSD swap are a must at this point, but these laptops will run nowhere the speed or resolution of a modern laptop. With the age and problems with some of these laptops id stop at those two upgrades. This being said, this laptop will still run a relatively new macOS version and will be usable for more basic tasks.\nMacBook Pro laptops don’t offer replaceable CPU’s \u0026 GPU’s (most newer laptop systems don’t either). You could replace the full logic board but are often limited to what the series used, so in your case these are the three possible choices 2012 15” MacBook Pro’s - MacBookPro9,1 So its best to get the one you want (can afford and/or find) for a working system Vs trying to piecemeal a system together. As far a RAM the max this series can support is 16GB (two 8 GB SO-DIMM’s) For drives you can put in any 2.5” HDD or SSD. that fits within the cases limit of 12.5 mm in height. uAs an example a Samsung 870 EVO comes in 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, 2TB \u0026 4TB sizes all will fit and work without any issues. Now the down side… The highest macOS this system will run is Catalina officially. I really don’t recommend using APFS on SATA based drives (system drive) so the highest I would go with Sierra which is the last macOS that uses HFS+ file system. The HD drive bay SATA cable tends to have issues if you have an older version. As such I do recommend upgrading it to the current version which iFixit sells and don’t fold it as many people damage the cable you want a nice radius of a curve where the cable needs to bend around. So your usage is limited to Intel based app’s as Apple is moving to their own M Series SoC’s (CPU/GPU and other stuff in a single chip/carrier) and app developers are quickly moving to support the new M Series SoC’s. That adds a wrinkle here as most of these newer apps will require Big Sur and newer to work properly. Hackintosh route is also at a dead end soon as well, as soon as Apple stops supporting Intel. Now some good news! This will likely take two to three years to rollout so you still have a sizable use window. For reference I’m banging on a 2012 15” MacBook Pro right now. This system is a good general purpose system. It is not as powerful as the new M1 Pro and Max SoC systems so if you are doing heavy game play or professional work it won’t be a good choice. If you are writing, basic presentation, web browsing and watching YouTube videos then this will be just fine! Just like buying a car we all don’t need a Porsche, when a Jeep is more than fine.\n","wordCount":"1065","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dallas Dobbs"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/limits-of-upgrading-components-macbook-pro-15-unibody-mid-2012-342899/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Are you wasting money on upgrading your Macbook Pro 15?
