# Transform Your Slow Computer in Seconds: Here's What You Need to Upgrade Your RAM!

Are you tired of your computer running at a snail's pace? Does browsing the web or opening multiple applications make you want to pull out your hair in frustration? If so, it's time to consider upgrading your computer's RAM.

RAM stands for Random Access Memory, and it's one of the essential components of your computer. It stores the data that the computer is currently using. Simply put, more RAM means that your computer can handle more data at once, which leads to smoother performance.

Here's what you need to know about upgrading your RAM to transform your slow computer in seconds.

## Determine How Much RAM You Need

Before you start shopping for RAM, you need to determine how much your computer needs. You can do this by opening the Task Manager and checking the performance tab. Look at the memory usage and make a note of the number.

Typically, 8GB of RAM is ideal for most users. However, if you use your computer for intensive work such as gaming, video editing, or graphic design, you may need more. 

## What Type of RAM is Compatible with My Computer?

Once you have determined how much RAM you need, it's essential to check what type of RAM is compatible with your computer. Different computers require different types of RAM, so it's essential to do your homework before purchasing.

The most common types of RAM are DDR3 and DDR4. DDR3 is older and generally cheaper, but it's not as fast as DDR4. DDR4 is the more recent type of RAM and provides faster performance.

## How to Install New RAM

Installing new RAM is relatively easy, even for a novice computer user. The exact process will vary depending on the type of computer you have, but most laptops and desktops require the following steps:

1. Turn off your computer.
2. Unplug any cords and remove the battery if you are upgrading a laptop.
3. Remove the cover from your computer and locate the RAM slots.
4. Gently push down on the tabs holding the current RAM to the motherboard or remove any screws holding the module.
5. Carefully remove the current RAM.
6. Insert the new RAM in the same orientation and with the same force that you used to remove the old RAM.
7. Push the tabs back into place or screw the module back in.
8. Put the cover back on your computer and plug everything back in.
9. Power on your computer and check to ensure that the RAM is recognized.

## Conclusion

Upgrading your RAM is one of the most cost-effective ways to boost your computer's performance. It's a quick and easy way to transform your slow computer into a significantly smoother and faster machine. Follow the steps above to determine how much RAM you need, what type of RAM is compatible with your computer, and how to install it. With just a few minutes of your time, you could have a computer that performs like a dream.

## Chosen Solution
 My laptop is a Asus X553SA with 2gig ram. I'm wanting to upgrade it to 8gig but I'm not sure if it is compatible. The current ram is 2Gig SOD 1.35V PC3 12800CL11. The one I've been looking at is iGig DDR3 PC3 10600. 1333MHz SoDIMM. Would it work in my system? Thanks for your time.

 No the Asus X553SA uses DDR3L PC3L wich is a special kind of DDR3 ram that has a low voltage(The L stands for Low) so you will need DDR3L PC3L ram instead. Here is it on NewEgg (https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=ddr3L+pc3l  )
