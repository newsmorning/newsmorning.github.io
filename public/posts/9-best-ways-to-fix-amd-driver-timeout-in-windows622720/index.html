Many Windows 10 users have reported the AMD driver timeout issue after upgrading their PCs or installing new graphics drivers.\nIf you are worried about this issue, don’t panic! There are several ways to resolve the problem quickly and easily. In this article, we will discuss the nine best methods to fix AMD driver timeouts in Windows.\nUpdate Your Graphics Driver Ensure that your graphics driver is up to date to prevent AMD driver timeouts. Go to your graphics card manufacturer’s website and find the driver that matches your graphics card model and Windows version.\nUninstall and Re-Install Graphics Driver If updating the driver doesn’t work, try uninstalling it and installing it back again. To do this, open Device Manager, navigate to Display Adapters, right-click on your AMD graphics card, and select Uninstall. Restart your computer and follow the process to install the latest graphics driver.\nLower the Hardware Acceleration Many applications that use hardware acceleration can cause AMD driver timeouts. To prevent this issue, you can lower the hardware acceleration. Go to Display settings \u003e Advanced \u003e Troubleshoot, then select the Change Settings button. Adjust the hardware acceleration to the minimum or disable it entirely.\nDisable Power Save Windows 10 comes with a feature that allows you to save power by reducing graphics performance. This feature can cause AMD driver timeouts. To disable it, right-click on the desktop and select Graphics Settings. Disable the Power Save feature.\nPerform a Clean Boot A clean boot allows you to disable all third-party apps and services that may interfere with your graphics driver. To perform a clean boot, press the Windows key + R, enter “msconfig,” and select OK. Go to Services and select Hide all Microsoft services. Then, select Disable all and reboot your computer.\nModify Registry Entries Modifying registry entries can also resolve AMD driver timeouts. Open the Registry Editor (Windows + R, enter “regedit,” and hit Enter) and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers. Create a new DWORD called TdrDelay with a value of 8.\nIncrease the Page File Size An insufficient page file size can also cause AMD driver timeouts. To resolve this issue, increase the Page File size. Go to Control Panel \u003e System and Security \u003e System \u003e Advanced system settings \u003e Performance Settings \u003e Advanced \u003e Change. Select the Custom size option and increase the size.\nDisable Overclocking If you have overclocked your graphics card, that may cause AMD driver timeouts. You can disable overclocking via your graphics card control panel.\nDisable Applications Running on Startup Applications running on startup can also cause AMD driver timeouts. Disable unnecessary applications on startup. To do this, open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc), navigate to the Startup tab, and right-click on the applications you want to disable.\nConclusion\nAMD driver timeouts can significantly disrupt the performance of your computer. However, these nine methods can help resolve the issue. Ensure that you follow these instructions correctly to guarantee the best results.\nDriver timeout is a fancy way of saying that Windows can no longer communicate with your AMD graphic card’s driver. Depending on why this is happening, there are different ways of solving the issue.\nA hardware failure is beyond any simple fix, but the culprit is usually a configuration issue. A faulty Windows update, corrupted system files, or even overheating can trigger this error. Let’s go over all of these potential problems and their fixes.\nFix 1: Update the Graphic Drivers The first thing to do when dealing with any sort of driver issue is to update the driver. Nine times out of ten, that does the job.\nAnd the AMD driver timeout issue is specifically one created by incompatible drivers. Sometimes it is the operating system that is outdated, but we will get to that later.\nTo get the latest drivers for your AMD graphics card, you should head to the manufacturer’s website. You’ll find the drivers on AMD’s own site, or if you have a laptop, on the site of the laptop brand as well.\nAs the driver versions differ from system to system, you will need to enter the model number of the laptop or the GPU to locate the correct drivers.\nThe laptop websites will give you a complete list of all compatible drivers, including VGA drivers for your graphic cards. There will be separate packages for the integrated and discrete GPUs if you have them both.\nDownload and run the VGA driver package after extracting its contents. And don’t worry about getting it wrong – the installer will automatically check your system’s hardware for compatibility.\nOnce everything matches up, you’ll be presented with the Install button.\nThe screen will sometimes flicker during the installation, so don’t panic if you see a black screen. The setup will inform you when the installation is complete.\nFix 2: Update Windows When the AMD driver is working correctly, the problem might instead lie with the OS. And fixing that is usually just a matter of installing the latest Windows updates.\nWe know that installing a Windows Update is another of those magic pills offered as a solution to anything wrong with your computer, but it usually works.\nOften, it is a faulty Windows Update creating the problem in the first place, since Microsoft issues bug patches in subsequent releases. You can also try rolling back the problematic update, but that’s just a temporary solution (though we still discuss this in the next section).\nTo install the latest Windows updates, open Settings by searching for it or clicking on the gear icon in the Start menu.\nScroll down to the Windows Update tab (the last on the list) and select Check for updates button.\nThis will display any available updates, along with a Download now button to download and install the update. Just select this option and Windows will take care of the rest.\nFix 3: Uninstall Windows Update Since the AMD driver timeout is often caused by a bugged Windows Update, it can also be resolved by simply uninstalling the update. It is a good stop-gap measure until the next update comes out and actually fixes the problem.\nOn Windows 11, you remove updates from a section of the settings. Just search for Uninstall Updates in the Start Menu to locate it.\nIn Windows 10 or earlier, open the Control Panel \u003e Programs. Then select View installed updates from under the Programs and Features category.\nEither way, you’ll get a list of installed Windows updates on your computer sorted by the date. If the problem started recently, uninstall the latest update on this list.\nFix 4: Repair Corrupted System Files Missing updates aren’t the only reason Windows might be unable to properly communicate with AMD drivers. Corrupted system files can cause such weird glitches as well.\nFortunately, you don’t have to reinstall your OS to fix this issue – command line utilities like SFC can easily repair damaged system files.\nTo run the SFC command, open Command Prompt. Search for it by typing “cmd” in the Start Menu and select Run as Administrator.\nThe System File Checker (SFC) is often paired with a DISM scan to ensure there are no errors due to a corrupted system image. All you need is to run the DISM command first:\nDism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\nDISM will now download a fresh version of the system image from Microsoft, using it to repair any inconsistencies for the local backup.\nOnce DISM is done, enter sfc /scannow to repair your Windows installation.\nThe scan can take a while, as SFC will verify the integrity of every system file and replace any missing or corrupted data.\nFix 5: Update BIOS We have now exhausted the realm of simple software fixes, and are getting into more technical territory. And the first step is to update the BIOS.\nThe BIOS version that comes preinstalled on your motherboard doesn’t usually require updates. But the AMD driver timeout bug is known to be caused by outdated BIOS – or incorrect BIOS settings – and can often be fixed with an update.\nBefore you go installing a new BIOS version though, boot into the BIOS and take a look at its settings. Some motherboards have a 4G decoding feature, which gives the GPU access to more memory.\nFix 6: Disable Overclocking Overclocking your processor – or your GPU – can boost performance beyond the stated limits. But in absence of proper cooling, it can lead to critical failures as well.\nOf course, this isn’t something that comes enabled by default, so you can skip this one if you haven’t overclocked your system. But if you have, it might be a good idea to disable it.\nNow depending on how you achieved the overclocking, the process to reverse it is going to differ. A GPU can be overclocked from the BIOS, a third-party utility, or AMD’s own driver settings. Just restore the settings to default, and your GPU will work normally again.\nFix 7: Prevent Overheating Overheating is a major problem with gaming laptops, which often come with poor thermals and ineffective cooling. Even good systems can eventually start heating up due to clogged fans and blocked vents.\nThe thing with overheating is that the symptoms aren’t clear to spot. The computer works fine up to a certain point, and then just abruptly cuts power, creating weird crashes.\nCheck the temperature of the GPU during heavy loads with a dedicated utility, and take precautions if you find the temperatures rising over 90℃. Cleaning up dust is a good solution, along with getting a cooling pad for laptops.\nReapplying thermal paste is incredibly useful as well, especially if the graphics card is on the older side. Many guides will also recommend undervolting the GPU, but that’s just a workaround – you’re better off addressing the thermals directly.\nFix 8: Tweak Settings for Performance If cleaning up the vents and reapplying thermal paste doesn’t solve the problem, you can try reducing the load on your GPU instead. By optimizing visual settings for performance rather than quality, even an aging graphics card can work smoothly.\nApart from the visual settings of individual video games, there are a lot of settings that affect graphics performance in Windows itself. From the power plan to visual effects or the monitor refresh rate, there’s no lack of potential optimizations.\nThen there are AMD Radeon features like FreeSync and Virtual Super Resolution that put a huge drain on the GPU. While these only come enabled on the latest graphics cards capable of handling the stress, disabling them might give you an edge.\nIf you’re using a laptop, the first thing you need to ensure is that the Power Plan is set to favor performance over battery savings. To do this, navigate to Power Options within the Control Panel. In Windows 11, you can also search for the Control Panel and open Power Options directly from the result.\nThe default is usually set to Balanced, which prioritizes power saving and performance equally. We want to set it to High Performance, or a custom plan that can do the same thing.\nOur next stop is Visual Effects. This consists of all the animation or advanced rendering performed for the Windows UI itself, and can be the source of a timeout error outside of gaming. To adjust this parameter, search for System Settings in the Start Menu.\nThis opens System Properties, containing many hidden Windows settings. Under the Advanced tab, you’ll find the Performance section. Click on its Settings button.\nFinally, we have found the Visual Effects window. Select the Adjust for best performance radio button to instantly disable most of the options.\nThese adjustments will reduce the load on your GPU, hopefully letting it function without any interruptions. In case you have an advanced rig with a high-end monitor and powerful graphics, reducing the refresh rate to 60Hz and deactivating features like FreeSync can also help.\nFix 9: Change the Hardware Configuration Often, making a hardware change can precipitate an AMD driver timeout error. In other cases, it can fix it.\nThings like adding new RAM modules or installing an SSD drive can affect the power available to the graphics card. Usually, the device will be able to roll with the punches, but occasionally it’s unable to adjust.\nIn these cases, switching PCI-E slots or simply reinstalling the card can solve the problem. Though you should only do this if you’re familiar with making hardware changes to your computer.\nWhat Is the Best Way to Fix the AMD Driver Timeout Error in Windows? Updates are all you need to fix an AMD driver timeout most of the time. This means updating the graphics drivers as well as Windows itself.\nAnother common reason for getting this error is outdated BIOS or corrupted system files. For this, you need to update the BIOS to its latest version and run an SFC scan to repair the Windows installation.\nIf all these methods fail to fix your problem, you’re dealing with a hardware issue. Overheating is the usual culprit, so cleaning up the fans and reapplying thermal paste can do the trick. You may also want to look into adjusting settings for performance, and perhaps even changing the hardware configuration of your PC.\n","wordCount":"2243","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Fernando Wilt"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/9-best-ways-to-fix-amd-driver-timeout-in-windows622720/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe these 9 foolproof methods to fix AMD driver timeouts in Windows!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 13, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2243 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Fernando Wilt</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#fix-1-update-the-graphic-drivers>Fix 1: Update the Graphic Drivers</a></li><li><a href=#fix-2-update-windows>Fix 2: Update Windows</a></li><li><a href=#fix-3-uninstall-windows-update>Fix 3: Uninstall Windows Update</a></li><li><a href=#fix-4-repair-corrupted-system-files>Fix 4: Repair Corrupted System Files</a></li><li><a href=#fix-5-update-bios>Fix 5: Update BIOS</a></li><li><a href=#fix-6-disable-overclocking>Fix 6: Disable Overclocking</a></li><li><a href=#fix-7-prevent-overheating>Fix 7: Prevent Overheating</a></li><li><a href=#fix-8-tweak-settings-for-performance>Fix 8: Tweak Settings for Performance</a></li><li><a href=#fix-9-change-the-hardware-configuration>Fix 9: Change the Hardware Configuration</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-the-best-way-to-fix-the-amd-driver-timeout-error-in-windows>What Is the Best Way to Fix the AMD Driver Timeout Error in Windows?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You Won&rsquo;t Believe These 9 Foolproof Methods to Fix AMD Driver Timeouts in Windows!</p><p>AMD graphics card users may face an issue with their graphics driver timeouts, which can cause significant damage to computer performance.

Search for it by typing “cmd” in the Start Menu and select Run as Administrator.</p></li><li><p>The System File Checker (SFC) is often paired with a DISM scan to ensure there are no errors due to a corrupted system image. All you need is to run the DISM command first:</p></li></ul><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p><ul><li><p>DISM will now download a fresh version of the system image from Microsoft, using it to repair any inconsistencies for the local backup.</p></li><li><p>Once DISM is done, enter sfc /scannow to repair your Windows installation.</p></li><li><p>The scan can take a while, as SFC will verify the integrity of every system file and replace any missing or corrupted data.</p></li></ul><h2 id=fix-5-update-bios>Fix 5: Update BIOS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fix-5-update-bios>#</a></h2><p>We have now exhausted the realm of simple software fixes, and are getting into more technical territory. And the first step is to update the BIOS.</p><p>The BIOS version that comes preinstalled on your motherboard doesn’t usually require updates. But the AMD driver timeout bug is known to be caused by outdated BIOS – or incorrect BIOS settings – and can often be fixed with an update.</p><p>Before you go installing a new BIOS version though, boot into the BIOS and take a look at its settings. Some motherboards have a 4G decoding feature, which gives the GPU access to more memory.</p><h2 id=fix-6-disable-overclocking>Fix 6: Disable Overclocking<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fix-6-disable-overclocking>#</a></h2><p>Overclocking your processor – or your GPU – can boost performance beyond the stated limits. But in absence of proper cooling, it can lead to critical failures as well.</p><p>Of course, this isn’t something that comes enabled by default, so you can skip this one if you haven’t overclocked your system. But if you have, it might be a good idea to disable it.</p><p>Now depending on how you achieved the overclocking, the process to reverse it is going to differ. A GPU can be overclocked from the BIOS, a third-party utility, or AMD’s own driver settings. Just restore the settings to default, and your GPU will work normally again.</p><h2 id=fix-7-prevent-overheating>Fix 7: Prevent Overheating<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fix-7-prevent-overheating>#</a></h2><p>Overheating is a major problem with gaming laptops, which often come with poor thermals and ineffective cooling. Even good systems can eventually start heating up due to clogged fans and blocked vents.</p><p>The thing with overheating is that the symptoms aren’t clear to spot. The computer works fine up to a certain point, and then just abruptly cuts power, creating weird crashes.</p><p>Check the temperature of the GPU during heavy loads with a dedicated utility, and take precautions if you find the temperatures rising over 90℃. Cleaning up dust is a good solution, along with getting a cooling pad for laptops.</p><p>Reapplying thermal paste is incredibly useful as well, especially if the graphics card is on the older side. Many guides will also recommend undervolting the GPU, but that’s just a workaround – you’re better off addressing the thermals directly.</p><h2 id=fix-8-tweak-settings-for-performance>Fix 8: Tweak Settings for Performance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fix-8-tweak-settings-for-performance>#</a></h2><p>If cleaning up the vents and reapplying thermal paste doesn’t solve the problem, you can try reducing the load on your GPU instead. By optimizing visual settings for performance rather than quality, even an aging graphics card can work smoothly.</p><p>Apart from the visual settings of individual video games, there are a lot of settings that affect graphics performance in Windows itself. From the power plan to visual effects or the monitor refresh rate, there’s no lack of potential optimizations.</p><p>Then there are AMD Radeon features like FreeSync and Virtual Super Resolution that put a huge drain on the GPU. While these only come enabled on the latest graphics cards capable of handling the stress, disabling them might give you an edge.</p><ul><li><p>If you’re using a laptop, the first thing you need to ensure is that the Power Plan is set to favor performance over battery savings. To do this, navigate to Power Options within the Control Panel. In Windows 11, you can also search for the Control Panel and open Power Options directly from the result.</p></li><li><p>The default is usually set to Balanced, which prioritizes power saving and performance equally. We want to set it to High Performance, or a custom plan that can do the same thing.</p></li><li><p>Our next stop is Visual Effects. This consists of all the animation or advanced rendering performed for the Windows UI itself, and can be the source of a timeout error outside of gaming. To adjust this parameter, search for System Settings in the Start Menu.</p></li><li><p>This opens System Properties, containing many hidden Windows settings. Under the Advanced tab, you’ll find the Performance section. Click on its Settings button.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we have found the Visual Effects window. Select the Adjust for best performance radio button to instantly disable most of the options.</p></li></ul><p>These adjustments will reduce the load on your GPU, hopefully letting it function without any interruptions. In case you have an advanced rig with a high-end monitor and powerful graphics, reducing the refresh rate to 60Hz and deactivating features like FreeSync can also help.</p><h2 id=fix-9-change-the-hardware-configuration>Fix 9: Change the Hardware Configuration<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fix-9-change-the-hardware-configuration>#</a></h2><p>Often, making a hardware change can precipitate an AMD driver timeout error. In other cases, it can fix it.</p><p>Things like adding new RAM modules or installing an SSD drive can affect the power available to the graphics card. Usually, the device will be able to roll with the punches, but occasionally it’s unable to adjust.</p><p>In these cases, switching PCI-E slots or simply reinstalling the card can solve the problem. Though you should only do this if you’re familiar with making hardware changes to your computer.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-best-way-to-fix-the-amd-driver-timeout-error-in-windows>What Is the Best Way to Fix the AMD Driver Timeout Error in Windows?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-the-best-way-to-fix-the-amd-driver-timeout-error-in-windows>#</a></h2><p>Updates are all you need to fix an AMD driver timeout most of the time. This means updating the graphics drivers as well as Windows itself.</p><p>Another common reason for getting this error is outdated BIOS or corrupted system files. For this, you need to update the BIOS to its latest version and run an SFC scan to repair the Windows installation.</p><p>If all these methods fail to fix your problem, you’re dealing with a hardware issue. Overheating is the usual culprit, so cleaning up the fans and reapplying thermal paste can do the trick. You may also want to look into adjusting settings for performance, and perhaps even changing the hardware configuration of your PC.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/list-of-screen-s-that-fit-on-x-macbook-system-macbook-air-13-mid-2012-1613184/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>You won't believe the amazing screens that fit perfectly on your Macbook Air 13 Mid 2012 - check out our ultimate list now!</span></a>
