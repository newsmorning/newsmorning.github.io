# iPhone 6 Screen Replacement Gone Wrong - Logic Board Failure Leaves Device Dead!

If you own an iPhone 6, chances are you might have experienced a cracked or shattered screen. If you're handy with repairs, you can save money by replacing the screen yourself, but there are some pitfalls you need to be aware of. One particular issue that has been known to occur is logic board failure following a screen replacement, which can leave your device completely dead.

So, what causes this problem and how can you avoid it? Let's take a closer look.

## Understanding the iPhone 6 Logic Board

Before we get into the details of the screen replacement process, it's important to understand what the logic board is and why it's significant. The logic board is the main circuit board that controls all the functions of your iPhone, including power management, audio, and visual display.

If the logic board fails or becomes damaged, it can cause a range of issues, including the device not turning on or experiencing random shutdowns. In extreme cases, the logic board may need to be replaced entirely, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.

## The Risks of Screen Replacement

Replacing the screen on an iPhone 6 may seem like a straightforward process, but there are risks involved. One of the primary risks is damaging the logic board, which can result in a non-functional device.

The most common cause of logic board failure during screen replacement is excessive force or pressure applied to the board itself. This can occur if the screws on the logic board shield are not correctly tightened or if the connectors on the board are not carefully disconnected and reconnected.

Another potential cause of logic board failure is using low-quality replacement screens or DIY kits that don't include the correct tools or instructions. These may cause damage to the device during the repair process, including internal components like the logic board.

## How to Avoid Logic Board Failure During Screen Replacement

If you're planning on replacing the screen on your iPhone 6, there are steps you can take to minimize the risk of logic board failure. Here are some tips for a successful repair:

### Use High-Quality Replacement Parts and Tools

One of the most important factors in avoiding logic board failure is using high-quality replacement parts and tools. This includes purchasing a genuine iPhone 6 screen and using a kit that includes all the necessary tools for the repair. With these tools, you can avoid applying excessive force or pressure to the logic board and connectors.

### Follow Instructions Carefully

When working on your iPhone 6, it's crucial to follow the instructions provided with your replacement screen and tool kit. This ensures that you're taking the correct steps to disconnect and reconnect the connectors on the logic board and shield, without damaging any internal components.

### Take Your Time and Be Gentle

Lastly, take your time and be gentle when replacing the screen on your iPhone 6. Rushing the repair process or using excessive force can lead to damage, especially to the logic board. Remember to double-check your work before reassembling your device and applying power.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while replacing the screen on your iPhone 6 can be a cost-effective way to repair a cracked or shattered display, it's essential to be aware of the risks involved. Logic board failure during screen replacement can leave your device completely dead, so following instructions carefully and using high-quality parts and tools can help minimize this risk. With the right approach, you can successfully replace your iPhone 6 screen without causing any damage to your device's internal components.

 Hey Guys pls help if u can..
well my screen broke 8 months ago and because of a couple of emergency operations and a dodgy seller on eBay it’s taken me until now to fix. I thought it a good idea to buy a spares/repair phone as I wanted an oem screen. The phone I bought (2nd one after the 1st arse seller!) looked ok. The guy said the screen started pixelating then one day wouldn’t turn on anymore. Clean as a whistle no bumps or dings I deduced using my zero knowledge of mobile phones that this was probably a software problem, anyway I only want the screen and battery as the guy said it was running well until the pixelating problem.
My phone i’ll add was running fine, I just dropped the bloody thing and smashed the screen.
So I though to cut time why not just swap the logic boards over as the doner phones problem was hopefully in that area….plus the inside of that phone compared to mine was sparkling…looked new whereas mine was dusty and worn out looking.
Ok…swapped out the logic boards no problem, plus the screen and carefully as possible the home button to hopefully preserve the touch id. Put em back together crossing fingers and toes then shazam….. nothing, not even a peep… opened phone, disconnected and reconnected battery, still nothing…  argghh… I really need a break, my first week of giving up smoking and have a lovely but very noisy toddler so please help meee!!

 Did u charge both phones before and checked the screen was at least working before starting any repairs???
U could have a damaged screen, u could have 2 totally flat batteries, u could have a damaged charging port… put the board back into it's original housing with it's original screen and check it again if it fails u could have done anything like causing long screw damage
