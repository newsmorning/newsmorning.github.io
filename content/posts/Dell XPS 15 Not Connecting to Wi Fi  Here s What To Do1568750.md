# Is Your Dell XPS 15 Refusing to Connect to Wi-Fi? Unlock the Secret Solution Now!


If you have a Dell XPS 15 laptop and it is refusing to connect to Wi-Fi, you are not alone. This is a common issue that many users have faced, and it can be very frustrating. However, the good news is that there is a secret solution that can help you fix this problem.

Before we dive into the solution, it is important to understand the underlying causes of the Wi-Fi connection issue. In most cases, the problem is caused by outdated or incorrect drivers, network settings, or issues with the router. Some users have also reported that the issue can be caused by malware or viruses.

If you have ruled out malware or virus issues, follow the steps below to unlock the secret solution:

Step 1: Update your drivers

The first thing you should do is ensure that your device drivers are up to date. You can easily check for driver updates by going to the Dell website and searching for the latest drivers for your XPS 15 model. Once you have downloaded and installed the updates, restart your device and check if the issue has been resolved.

Step 2: Reset your network settings

If updating your drivers did not solve the problem, you may need to reset your network settings. To do this, go to the Start menu, type “network reset” in the search bar, and click on the “Reset Network” option. Follow the on-screen prompts and restart your device once it is done.

Step 3: Restart your router

If the problem persists, you should restart your router. This will refresh the network connection between your device and the router, which may fix the connection issue. Simply unplug your router from the power source, wait for a few seconds, and then plug it back in. Allow it to restart and try to connect to Wi-Fi again.

Step 4: Check firewall settings

Finally, if none of the above steps work, check your firewall settings. In some cases, the firewall may be blocking your device from connecting to Wi-Fi. To check your firewall settings, go to the Start menu, type “firewall” in the search bar, and click on the “Windows Defender Firewall” option. From there, you can choose to either turn off the firewall or add exceptions.

In conclusion, a Dell XPS 15 refusing to connect to Wi-Fi can be a frustrating problem, but there is always a solution. By updating your device drivers, resetting network settings, restarting your router, and checking firewall settings, you can easily fix this problem. So, if you ever face this issue, don't panic. Follow these steps and you will be back online in no time.

Dell has been including the Killer wireless network adapters in the XPS series, which has led to a lot of connectivity-related issues for users. 
 
While many replace the adapter and use another brand instead, it’s not always the right approach. We have taken up both its advantages and disadvantages later to help you make a decision.
 
So, let’s see what you can do if Dell XPS is not connecting to Wi-Fi.
 
## Why is my Dell laptop not finding my Wi-Fi?
 
It’s possible that this problem was caused by an incompatible driver or one that was simply out of date. In addition, there might be other parameters for the Wi-Fi network that are incorrectly set up. 
 
After making the necessary adjustments to the Wi-Fi adapter using the steps outlined below, you may move on to implementing alternative solutions.
 
This being said, let’s jump into the list of methods that you can apply in order to fix the Dell XPS not connecting to the Wi-Fi issue. Follow along!
 
## What do I do if Dell XPS 15 is not connecting to Wi-Fi?
 
### 1. Re-enable the Wi-Fi adapter
 
- Press Windows + R to launch the Run command, enter ncpa.cpl in the text field, and either click OK or hit Enter to launch the Network Connections window.
 - Right-click on the Wi-Fi adapter and select Disable from the context menu.
 - Once done, again right-click on it and select Enable.
 - After making the changes, check if Dell XPS is now connecting to Wi-Fi.

 
In most cases, simply re-enabling the Wi-Fi adapter worked for most, and you should try this method before moving on to the more intricate ones.
 
### 2. Update the Wi-Fi adapter driver
 
- Press Windows + S to launch the Search menu, enter Device Manager in the text field, and click on the relevant search result that appears.
 - Double-click on the Network adapters entry here to expand and view the devices under it.
 - Right-click on the Wi-Fi adapter and select Update driver from the context menu.
 - Next, select Search automatically for drivers from the two options in the Update Drivers window.

 
Once the Wi-Fi driver is updated, check if the Dell XPS not connecting to the Wi-Fi issue is fixed. In case, you were unable to update this way, learn how to manually install the driver in Windows 11.
 
Also, to keep things simple, you could use a reliable third-party app. We recommend a dedicated tool that ensures automatic installation of the latest driver versions for all those available on your PC.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

If the Dell XPS 15 Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting, making these changes could really help. But, remember that this method is only applicable for the Killer wireless network adapters.
 
Some of the most common Windows errors and bugs are a result of old or incompatible drivers. The lack of an up-to-date system can lead to lag, system errors or even BSoDs.
To avoid these types of problems, you can use an automatic tool that will find, download, and install the right driver version on your Windows PC in just a couple of clicks, and we strongly recommend DriverFix. Here’s how to do it:
 
- Download and install DriverFix.
 - Launch the application.
 - Wait for DriverFix to detect all your faulty drivers.
 - The software will now show you all the drivers that have issues, and you just need to select the ones you’d liked fixed.
 - Wait for DriverFix to download and install the newest drivers.
 - Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

### 4. Replace the network adapter

### Where is the Wi-Fi switch on my Dell laptop?

If for some reason, it doesn’t work for you, you can still change your Wi-Fi by going into your PC’s settings.
 
That’s all there is to the problem! Though in all likelihood, the need to replace the adapter should not arise and the other methods should help eliminate the Dell XPS not connecting to the Wi-Fi issue.
