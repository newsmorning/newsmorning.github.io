The Infinix Hot-line of smartphones has always represented the classic winning recipe for smartphones in emerging markets – all the important specs you need and nothing that you don’t, all at an affordable price.
 
As such, this line of phones has been rather popular among the youth and especially, university students who are often cash-strapped but still desire a solid smartphone experience. The Infinix Hot 11 devices delivered on these key metrics and now, Infinix is ready to take another shot at this with the launch of the Infinix Hot 12 series.
 
The Infinix Hot 12 Play has just been unveiled in Kenya and in this post, we shall be looking at what you’ll be getting should you choose to get yourself one of these units.
 
## Specifications
 
Sticking to the tried and tested recipe, the Infinix Hot 12 Play comes with a decently sized 6,000 mAh battery that, coupled with the modest, power-sipping internals, already looks like a solid endurance champ.
 
The device also sports a 6.82-inch 720p display with a 90Hz refresh rate, just like its predecessor and many of Infinix’s latest devices, but adds a 180Hz touch sampling rate for those fast-paced gaming sessions.
 
The Infinix Hot 12 Play comes with 4GB or 6GB of RAM across all the storage variants which might be on the lower side even in 2022 but then Infinix makes up for this by employing the RAM expansion technology that is becoming more and more popular these days as internal storage gets faster.
 
This allows the device to expand its RAM by adding up to 5GB of Virtual RAM from the ROM. This tech has been proven to allow devices to keep more and more apps running in the background with little fuss and it’ll be interesting to see how it works on this unit.
 
The Hot 12 Play also employs the USB type C port, something that recent Infinix devices have been getting a lot of flack for. Sadly, no 5G support is added and you still have to deal with Infinix’s bloated and ad-ridden XOS, this time based on Android 12.
 
## Pricing and Availability
 
The Infinix Hot 12 Play is available in Racing Black, Legend White, and Origin Blue color options. In Kenya, it goes for Ksh. 16,499 for the 4GB RAM and 64GB ROM variant and Ksh 18,499 for the 4+128GB model. These should be in local stores and popular e-commerce sites over the next few days.
