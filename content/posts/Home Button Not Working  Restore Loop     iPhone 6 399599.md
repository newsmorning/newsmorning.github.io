Is your iPhone 6 stuck in a restore loop? Find out why your home button is not working and how to fix it ASAP!

The iPhone 6 is an exceptional device that has remained one of the most popular smartphones in the world. However, like any other smartphone, the iPhone 6 can also experience performance issues and software glitches.

One of the most common problems with the iPhone 6 is the issue of getting stuck in a restore loop. When you try to restore your iPhone 6 via iTunes, the restore process may keep repeating, resulting in your iPhone 6 getting stuck in a restore loop.

If your iPhone 6 is stuck in a restore loop, there's a high probability that the home button on your iPhone is not working correctly. The home button is vital to any iPhone user as it serves as a navigational tool to access the iPhone's features and functions. When the home button malfunctions, the iPhone becomes virtually unusable.

So, why is your home button not working on your iPhone 6? Well, it could be due to a hardware problem such as wear and tear, water damage, or any physical damage to the iPhone. However, it's often a software glitch that causes the home button to malfunction.

Thankfully, there are a few solutions you can try to fix your iPhone 6 home button and get your device out of the restore loop.

1. Recalibrate your home button

If the home button is not working correctly, recalibrating it might just be the solution you need. To recalibrate the home button, follow the steps below:

• Open any app on your iPhone and hold down the sleep/wake button until the "slide to power off" option appears.

• Release the power button and press and hold the home button for about 5-10 seconds.

• You should see your iPhone return to the home screen, and your home button should recalibrate and start working correctly.

2. Perform a hard reset

If the recalibration doesn't work, then you can perform a hard reset to fix the software issue.

• Press and hold the home button and the sleep/wake button (power button) simultaneously.

• Keep holding the buttons until the Apple logo appears and then release the buttons.

• Once your iPhone restarts, check if the home button is working as expected.

3. Restore iPhone in DFU Mode

If the above solutions don't work, then you should try restoring your iPhone 6 via DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode. DFU mode helps to refresh the software of your iPhone, ensuring that any software glitches that caused the home button to malfunction are eliminated.

To restore your iPhone 6 via DFU mode:

• Connect your iPhone 6 to your computer and launch iTunes.

• Hold down the home button and sleep/wake button for about 10 seconds.

• Release the sleep button but continue holding the home button.

• Your iPhone screen turns black, and iTunes should detect a device in DFU mode.

• Follow the prompts in iTunes to restore your device.

In conclusion, a malfunctioning home button can be a nuisance, especially when it causes your iPhone 6 to get stuck in a restore loop. But with these solutions, you can quickly fix your home button and get your iPhone 6 working correctly in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I just got my screen, back plate, and front camera to replace my iphone 6, however after I put it in, I realized that my iphone 6’s home button was not functioning. I tried replugging in all the flex cables, however that did not fix my cause. So, I decided to put my iphone into recovery mode and when I did that it said that there was a problem and my phone may need to be updated or restored. I tried updating, but after the process my iphone went back to the support.apple/support/restore. I then tried to restore however that did not work and it still went back to the support apple restore screen. Whenever I unplug my phone from my pc and turn it on it goes to the Hello apple screen however my home button still does not work. Is this a software problem or is a home button problem? I don’t think its a home button problem because I can use the homebutton to get to dfu and recovery mode. I’ve tried multiple restores and updates however nothing works. Thank you for anyone that contributes!

 Try the update without the home button plugged in or try 3utools to kick the phone out of recovery mode…
When you replaced the screen did you use the original home button and flex that goes at the back of the screen?
