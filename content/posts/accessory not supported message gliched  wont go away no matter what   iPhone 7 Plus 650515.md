You won't BELIEVE what's happening with this iPhone 7 Plus - 'Accessory Not Supported' message glitched and can't be fixed!

The iPhone 7 Plus is one of Apple's more popular models, and it's easy to see why. The phone is sleek, stylish, and comes packed with a ton of features that make it stand out from the rest of the competition. However, even this technological marvel is susceptible to glitches, and one such issue has recently surfaced – the 'Accessory Not Supported' message glitch.

The 'Accessory Not Supported' message is a nagging issue that has been plaguing iPhone 7 Plus users for quite some time now. It appears on the phone's screen when a third-party accessory, such as a charger or a headphone, is plugged into the lightning port. Apple had initially designed this feature into their devices to prevent users from accidentally damaging the phone with a poor-quality, unauthorised accessory, but now it seems to have developed into an irresolvable problem for several users.

One fix that was suggested initially was to clean the lightning port carefully. However, this cure-all turned out to be futile, and many users continued to face the same problem. The issue is not limited to any one accessory, which suggested that the error lies within the software, rather than the hardware.

The only possible solution to this issue put forth by Apple is to force restart your iPhone, but this fix only appears to be temporary. The 'Accessory Not Supported' message reappears moments after the iPhone is charged or while trying to use headphones. This issue has led to a considerable amount of frustration amongst iPhone 7 Plus users, and many are now beginning to wonder whether they made the wrong decision when they bought the phone.

Several users have vented their disappointment and anger on various online forums, social media platforms and tried reaching out to Apple’s customer support, but the problem still persists. Many users find it challenging to comprehend why the technological giant hasn't been able to provide a permanent solution to this problem. This leaves owners with a few choices – they could either switch to another model, purchase an Apple-certified accessory, wait for a solution or continue to live with the issue.

In conclusion, the 'Accessory Not Supported' message glitch has been one of the most frustrating issues for owners of the iPhone 7 Plus. While Apple has provided a few temporary solutions to this problem, the issue seems deeply rooted within the phone's software. With no permanent answer yet, it seems the only option left for users is to consult authorised dealers or Apple support to find a solution, or wait for a fix in future updates.

## Chosen Solution
 no matter what i do it wont go away and i accidently triggered the sos feature while trying to do a hard shut off and i cant unlock it or interact with anything on the screen except the dismiss button which wont work. please help

 Give the force restart another go. Make sure you are using the proper method. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have a unique button combination.
Other than that, this message can be triggered by a shoddy charger or accessory. Plugging a different one in may clear it. Otherwise, a reboot is likely your best option.
