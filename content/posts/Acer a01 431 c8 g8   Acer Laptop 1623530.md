How to get star t page back click on control center and my start page dissapeared

 Sound like your taskbar on the bottom is missing right?
If it is, go down to the bottom and you should see it pop up. When it does right click while your cursor is on it and there should be an option for auto hiding it. If there isnt, there should be an option that says properties, clock on that and there should be an option in the properties window to not auto hide.
if this isnt the issue please elaborate more on whats going on and please include a picture of whats happening so I can better help.
Hope this helps and good luck fixing!
