## Chosen Solution
 Hey. I have no power on laptop. Green light works. only no power at all. no fan spin. checked voltages its seems ok but only one chip is bugging and getting heated while mag-safe is connected. chip called  u7201. Any ideas why this chip could be foulty ? if i would change it does the problem should be gone or not ? Sorry for my bad english, hope you understand me. cheers

 Here’s the chips specs TI TPS51125
If it’s damaged it will need to be replaced. This is not an easy chip to install, I would strongly recommend you find someone with SMT soldering skills and the proper tool’s to do it.
