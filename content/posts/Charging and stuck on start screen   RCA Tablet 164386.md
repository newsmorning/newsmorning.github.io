Title: You Won't Believe What's Keeping Your RCA Tablet Stuck on the Start Screen – Find Out Now!

Have you ever experienced your RCA tablet getting stuck on the start screen and not being able to proceed to access your apps or any other features? It can be frustrating, and you may wonder what is wrong with your device. While it can be tempting to panic and assume that your tablet is broken, this is not necessarily the case. There are various reasons why your RCA tablet may get stuck on the start screen, and understanding them can help you solve the issue quickly and easily.

The following are some reasons why your RCA tablet may be stuck on the start screen:

1. System Updates: System updates are necessary to keep your tablet running smoothly and efficiently. However, sometimes these updates can cause your tablet to get stuck on the start screen. When a system update is downloading or installing, it may take longer than expected, and your tablet may appear to be stuck. If this is the case, give it some time to allow the update to complete.

2. Low Battery: If your RCA tablet has a low battery, it may not have the power to boot up to the home screen. The battery may have depleted while it was not in use, which can cause it to get stuck on the start screen. Ensure that your tablet has enough battery power, and if not, charge it for a while before trying to restart it.

3. App Issues: A malfunctioning app can cause your RCA tablet to get stuck on the start screen. If you installed an app that is not compatible with your device or one that has a bug, it can cause your tablet to become unresponsive. Try removing any recently installed apps, and see if that helps.

4. Damaged Software: Your tablet's software can become damaged, leading to it getting stuck on the start screen. You may need to reinstall the software to fix the problem. Ensure that you back up your data before restoring your tablet to its original factory settings.

5. Physical Damage: Physical damage to your tablet can cause it to get stuck on the start screen. If you dropped your tablet or spilled liquid on it, the damage could interfere with its ability to power on correctly. In this case, you may need to take it to a professional for repair.

In conclusion, getting stuck on the start screen can happen to anyone's RCA tablet. However, knowing what causes it can help you quickly solve the issue. Ensure that your tablet’s battery is charged, avoid installing incompatible apps, and protect your device from physical damage. With a little troubleshooting and a bit of patience, you can have your RCA tablet up and running in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 When I plug my tablet in both with its own charger and my USB it says charging but when I try turning it on I get  a yellow triangle with an exclamation point over the battery  at first it was stuck on the start screen and would not g anywhere after rebooting it now it will not turn on even with charger plugged in

 @lgu97701  sounds like you either have a bad battery or a bad charging port/charger. Check the voltage on the charger. If that works I would consider replacing the battery and while you are doing that inspect the charging port to ensure it does not have any broken pins etc., and is still properly connected.
