Revive Your Dead iPhone7 with This One Simple Home Button Repair Trick!

Are you facing the common issue of a broken home button on your iPhone7? Is it frustrating you from accessing the main menu or completing other vital tasks on your phone? If yes, then you might be wondering how to fix the problem. The good news is that you don't need to go to an expensive repair shop or replace the entire device. You can quickly restore functionality with a simple home button repair trick that is easy, affordable, and effective.

The home button is a crucial component of your iPhone as it enables you to return to the main screen or trigger Siri. However, after extended usage, it can become less responsive, damaged, or fail entirely. When such an issue occurs, it can render your phone useless, leaving you with no control over your device. But don't panic! With a few tools and steps, you can fix the problem in the comfort of your home.

The following is a step-by-step guide on how to revive your dead iPhone7 home button:

Step 1: Download an app called AssistiveTouch

AssistiveTouch is a built-in feature offered by Apple that creates a software-based home button on your screen. It provides a temporary solution for a broken home button until you can undertake the actual repair. Simply go to Settings> General> Accessibility> AssistiveTouch> On. You will see a small circle-like button displayed on your screen that acts as your new home button.

Step 2: Clean the home button area

Sometimes, the home button fails because of dirt, grime, or debris that accumulates around the edges or on the button itself. Use a microfiber cloth or a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean the area gently. Be sure to use minimal water or cleaning fluids to avoid damage to your phone.

Step 3: Calibrate the home button

Calibrating the home button will help it recalibrate its sensitivity level and improve its responsiveness. To calibrate the button, open any app on your phone and hold the power button until you see the slider button to switch off. Release the power button and hold the home button until the app closes, and the home screen appears.

Step 4: Replace the home button

If the above steps fail, then you might need to replace the home button entirely. An affordable and easy solution is to purchase a replacement home button kit online or at your local store. The kit comes with all the necessary tools and instructions needed to undertake the repair. You can watch DIY videos or refer to the kit instructions to replace the button yourself.

Conclusion

A broken home button doesn't have to send you into a frenzy. You can revive your dead iPhone7 with this simple home button repair trick that is affordable, effective, and easy to implement. By following this guide, you can regain control of your device and continue using it without significant interruptions.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
Upon changing the battery within my iPhone 7 the home button does not function at all.
Reading online, it said that the most likely issue was due to ripping the home button flex cable, therefore, I ordered a replacement home button to return the functions (apart from Touch ID).
The replacement part when fitted also did not work! Therefore, I am thinking that the issue is not with the button but with the LCD flex cable. Has anyone else had the same issue?
I think my best bet is to order a replacement LCD and test that with the original home button? Anyone else agree?
Thanks

 Yes that should fix the problem. The home button flex cable from the screen usually gets a small tear right at the bend. Sometimes it is very hard to see without magnification. A new screen will return your original home buttons function.
