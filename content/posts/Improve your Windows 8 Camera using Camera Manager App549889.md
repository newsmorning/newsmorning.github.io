The camera app in Windows 8 comes with several in built features that are ensuring good quality images and a great user experience when talking about real time video messaging or video calls. But, if you feel that you can obtain more from your camera, you should try a new software which is now available on Windows Store.
Thus Camera Manager is a new Windows 8 tool that can be used on any device, whether we are talking about a Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 based laptop, tablet or desktop. So, with this software your camera will be improved even if you are only using a front facing shooter for establishing video calls or low resolutions pictures with your family or friends. On the other matter, if you want to upgrade your tablet’s rear facing camera, then Camera Manager will bring great features and options which will customize and optimize the performances of your camera and which will ensure a better user experience of the same.
 
## Get the best out of your Windows 8 camera with Camera Manager
 
Camera Manager will be great for touch based devices on which the default camera app isn’t so great. With this new app you will be able to improve the performances and of course to capture great moments even on low light or other conditions that might usually ruin your photo session.
 
At the same time with Camera Manager you will be able to adjust the Brightness, Contrast, AWB and focus, receive funny effects, Media Style, Filter and Photo frame or establish multiple face tracking options in order to capture only the best moments.
 
So, basically with this dedicated camera app you will use your default Windows camera better even when dealing with unfavorable conditions. Unfortunately, the app isn’t available for Windows RT so you will be able to test the same only on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 based devices. Camera Manager is available on Windows Store where it is priced at $1.99.
 
Download Camera Manager from Windows Store.
