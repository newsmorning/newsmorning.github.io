New updates are being added at the bottom of this story…
 
Original story (published on October 19, 2021) follows:
 
Infinix is back at it again with the release of its latest addition to the Note series. This is a similar series to the Camon series of Tecno because they both feature the second-best offering of their respective brands behind the Phantom and Zero series. Surely enough, the Infinix Note 11 Pro arrives on the heels of the Tecno Camon 18 Premier with a nice design and a pretty stacked spec sheet. Also, sporting the MediaTek Helio G96 processor, the smartphone has the best SoC on an Infinix phone. Nonetheless, this does not make it better than the Infinix Zero X Pro which is still Infinix’s flagship.
 
## Infinix Note 11 Pro Specs

Right off the bat here, you can see the similarity with the Infinix Zero X Pro here with the camera module design and the central notch absent the box edges. As far as design goes, the smartphone adopts a nice conventional glossy finish with a curved plastic frame and slim bezels. At 6.95 inches, the display is quite large which makes it nicer for media consumption and a bit of gaming here and there. The screen also has a 120Hz refresh rate which is nice to see as well as a 180Hz sampling rate.
 
Furthermore, you also have 8GB RAM here which is somewhat like the standard for midrange Tecno and Infinix smartphones these days. With it, you have a 128GB storage space with a dedicated SD card slot for expansion up to 2TB. The Helio G96 processor is also thrown in here same as the Tecno Camon 18P and 18 Premier.
 
As for how good the camera on the Infinix Note 11 Pro is? There is a 64MP main camera, 13MP telephoto and 2MP depth camera to cater to our needs. On the front end, you’ve got a 16MP selfie shooter in place which can shoot up to 1080p videos. There is up to 30x zoom thanks to the telephoto camera which you shouldn’t expect to be crispy clear but a nice feature to have nonetheless.
 
In conclusion, the Infinix Note 11 Pro is not much of an improvement on the Note 10 Pro released earlier this year but you do get a whole lot of features for just 129, 000 Naira  ($230). At this price, this is a cheaper alternative to the Infinix Zero X Pro and Tecno Phantom X.
