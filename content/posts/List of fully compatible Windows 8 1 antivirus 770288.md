If you updated to Windows 8.1, you might now be thinking which antivirus software to install, right? There are so many out there, e.g., McAfee, Avast, Panda, Kasperkey, etc., that can be difficult to choose one. But one thing sure is with Windows 8.1 you’re protected from day one. As I noted in a previous article dealing with antivirus solutions, Windows 8.1 comes with Windows Defender (also known as Microsoft Security Essentials in Windows 7), which for those unfamiliar, this is a free antivirus software from Microsoft, so you don’t get a new antivirus right away, you can take your time and make the right choice.
 
Windows Defender may not be the best, but it works great, I always recommend it before spending money in some big names, which most of them are pretty annoying with alerts, pop-ups, and promotions. But of course you can always opt to install a third-party security solution. Below I compiled a list of well-known antivirus software that are now fully compatible to work in Windows 8.1.
 
## Windows 8.1 antivirus list
 
- McAfee Antivirus Plus 2012 and McAfee Antivirus (version 16)
 - Avast Antivirus Pro (version 7 and 8)
 - Dr Web antivirus (version 7 and 8)
 - PC Tools Spyware Doctor with Antivirus 2012 (version 9)
 - Panda Cloud Antivirus Free (version 2) and Panda Antivirus Pro 2013 (version 12)
 - Rising Antivirus 2011 (version 23)
 - Kasperkey Anti Virus 2012 (version 12)

 
Really important note: as you can see in the list, most of the security software aren’t the latest version. This is because I’m basing the Windows 8.1 antivirus list on products that has been listed to be compatible in the latest version of the operating system in the “Microsoft Compatibility Center” with information from real people with real experience using the product.
 
Remember one antivirus is good, two is problematic; just decide on one of the product install and keep it up to date. It is worth noting that you won’t be able to uninstall Windows Defender when installing a third-party security software, but the operating system will automatically disable it, so you only have one antivirus running in your system.
 
Also the software are always being updated, as such depending when you are reading this, new antivirus may be ready for Windows 8.1. To get the most updated list of compatible software, check the Microsoft Compatibility Center and use the keyword antivirus.
