It all started on a regular Sunday morning. I was lying on my couch, enjoying my cup of coffee and watching a movie on my Hitachi Plasma TV when suddenly, the unthinkable happened!

Out of nowhere, there was a loud pop and the screen turned black. At first, I thought it was just a temporary glitch, so I restarted the TV, only to realize that it was no longer working. I was shocked and disappointed, as I had bought the TV just a few months ago and had paid a considerable amount of money for it.

My initial reaction was to call the customer service of Hitachi to see what could be done. I was informed that the warranty period had expired, and I would have to pay for the repair costs. However, to my dismay, the repair cost was exorbitant and not something I could afford.

That's when I decided to do some research online and try to figure out why my Hitachi Plasma TV had stopped working. To my surprise, I found out that this was a common issue with Hitachi Plasma TVs, and it was caused by a faulty circuit board. Many users had reported this problem, and despite numerous complaints to the company, Hitachi had refused to acknowledge and fix the issue.

This was an eye-opener for me as I realized that despite being a reliable brand, Hitachi wasn't immune to faulty products. It was disappointing to see a company of this stature not take responsibility for its faulty products and leave its customers in the lurch.

In conclusion, the unexpected occurrence involving my Hitachi Plasma TV was a major disappointment. It not only affected my entertainment but also made me lose faith in the company. It's imperative for companies to take responsibility for their products and provide adequate support to their customers. It's a high time that Hitachi acknowledges and fixes the issue.

## Chosen Solution
 Need help getting my Hitachi Plasma TV running again. Currently when plugged in the standby light is red (as normal). When the power button is pushed the light changes to green and the TV sounds like it is turning on, but after 1-2 seconds the green light changes back to red and the TV sounds like it is turning off.  Nothing appears on screen during this time.
TV model is 42PD9500TA.  Any help much appreciated!
Photos added of back, hopefully helps with reviewing current status:

 @csew004 start off by checking your TV with the PDP panel self-diagnosis function
This function is for a PDP panel failure with no picture.
To enter to this Self-Diagnosis mode, follow the next steps:
Preparation:
1) The Power Cord should be connected to AC line and the Main Power switch should be turned on.
2) Turn the power off by the SUB-POWER button of the monitor or the remote control.
Procedure:
1) Press the SUB-POWER button and ▼ button on the bottom of the monitor at the same time, and keep it for more than 5 seconds after the power turned on.
2) It generates red blinking series of the power indicator light.
3) Any operation would cancel the Self -Diagnosis mode.
4) The next table shows the PDP PWB in which failure most probably would be allocated according to the number of blinks.
Number of red blinks of power indication light ==> Presumed failing PWB of PDP panel
1==> Logic
2==> X-SUS
3==> Y-SUS, SDM SDM: Scan Driver Module
4==> X-SUS, Y-SUS, SDM, PSU PSU: Power Supply Unit
5==> ABUS, ADM, PSU ADM: Address Driver Module
6==> ADM temperature
7==> ADM temperature
8==> All of above-mentioned PWB’s
Let us know what you get with the test
Update (07/26/2018)
Time to open up your TV and start with some basic testing.

While you are working on your TV, take some good pictures of your boards etc. Post those with your question. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that. It will allow us to see what you see.
Let us know what you find.

 Since this shuts down this quickly, there is a power problem detected and the set enters safety shutdown.  Since this set is likely over 5 years old, I would open it up and take a look at the power board.  I have seen many plasma sets that fail in this manner due to defective capacitors on the power supply board.  These have deteriorated  over time, but finally failed enough to cause this problem.  If you area unsure, open up the back and take some photos of the boards and post them here. We'll take a look and perhaps point out the bad parts.

 I did what was suggested… there is a red light on the standby and it is a steady red light… no blinking
