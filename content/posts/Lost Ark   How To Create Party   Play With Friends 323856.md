Unlock the Ultimate Gaming Experience with Lost Ark: Discover How to Assemble the Perfect Party and Team Up with Friends!

If you're a fan of MMORPG games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV, then you're sure to be excited about the upcoming release of Lost Ark. This Korean-made game is set to take the genre by storm with its stunning graphics, dynamic gameplay, and engaging storyline.

One of the key features of Lost Ark is its party system, which allows players to team up with friends and tackle challenges together. Whether you're exploring the open world, taking on challenging dungeons, or engaging in intense PvP battles, having the right team composition can make all the difference.

So how do you assemble the perfect party in Lost Ark? Here are some tips to get you started:

1. Choose your class wisely

Lost Ark offers 14 different classes, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. When building your party, it's important to choose classes that complement each other and cover all the necessary roles. For example, a well-rounded party might include a tank (such as the Paladin), a healer (such as the Bard), and several damage-dealing classes (such as the Gunlancer or Hawkeye).

2. Communicate with your team

Communication is key when working as a team in Lost Ark. Make sure you have a way to communicate with your party members, whether it's through in-game chat, voice chat, or a third-party app like Discord. Discuss your team's strategy, assign roles and responsibilities, and make sure everyone is on the same page.

3. Use your skills wisely

Each class in Lost Ark has a variety of skills and abilities that can be used to devastating effect in combat. Make sure you're familiar with your class's skills and how they can be used in different situations. For example, a Paladin might use their shield skills to protect their allies, while a Summoner might use their pets to distract enemies.

4. Be flexible

In a game like Lost Ark, things don't always go according to plan. Be prepared to adapt to changing circumstances and adjust your strategy as necessary. For example, if one of your party members goes down, you might need to switch roles or use different skills to keep the party alive.

With these tips in mind, you'll be well on your way to unlocking the ultimate gaming experience in Lost Ark. So gather your friends, form your party, and get ready for an adventure like no other!

Lost Ark is a multiplayer game that’s best experienced with your pals instead of complete strangers. If you want to invite, add and create a party with friends, here’s everything you need to know. There are a few things you need to keep in mind regarding being in the same server, world, instance and when exactly you can start playing Lost Ark with friends.
 
## Lost Ark – How to Play with Friends
 

 
Table of Contents
 
To be able to add friends, you need to continue playing the campaign mode and reach a point when you will see Ch.X on the screen which indicates the Channel. Just check the top right section of the game screen and you should see your channel number. That’s the same number that your friend should have as well so that you both can play together. So, if you don’t see it yet, keep playing and you should be able to see it soon.
 
### How to Invite and Add Friends to play Multiplayer?
 
Before creating your party, you will have to add your friend in the game. To send an invite, follow these steps.
 
- Open Community by clicking on the Chat bubble icon at the bottom right of the screen.
 - On the Friends window, click on the Friends tab.
 - Next, click on Friend Request at the bottom-left section of the window.
 - Type your friend’s IGN (in-game name) and send them a request.
 - After they accept the request, then it’s time to add them to your party.

 
## How to Create a Party in Lost Ark and Add your Friends?
 
Now that your IRL friend is your in-game friend in Lost Ark, you need to right-click on their character name and click on Invite to Party. You can do this if you have created the party yourself. Otherwise, you can let the creator know to do the same. As soon as that’s done, they will be added to your party as indicated by the changes in the HUD (their health bar will be shown). This means now you both are in the same world and server.
 
Apart from this, you can use the chat command /inviteparty friendplayername or /invite friendplayername without brackets to add them to your party.
 
In case your friend is in the same world with you but not in your party, press CTRL and right-click on your friend’s character. Then, choose Group Invitation and they will get added to your squad.
 
It’s important that you plan with your friends about which server to join because if you want to change your server, you will have to start over with a new character. Yes, you cannot change servers/transfer characters from one server or another (as of now) so your decision has to be carefully made with the help of your friends.
 
## Can you Add Friends on Different Servers in Lost Ark?
 
Unfortunately, you cannot add and play with friends on different servers. You have to be in the same world and same server to see each other in the game and play together. If you wish to play with a friend who is on a different server, you have to create a new character on that server and start over. Players cannot add another player from a different server to your friends list or even your guild. This is because the name that you give to your character is strictly for the server you have chosen.
 
So before creating a character, make sure to plan out the server you and your friends wish to play on, so that during the end-game content, you have someone to play with.
 
There are some game modes that you can play that has the option of cross-server players joining in. But the condition is that the other server should be in the same region as your character.
 
- Raids
 - Dungeons
 - Auction House
 - Boss Rush
 - The Cube
 - Platinum Fields
 - Ranked PvP Arena

 
That’s all about adding friends and how to create a party in Lost Ark. If you are also curious to know how to leave a Guild in Lost Ark, how to change servers, how to leave a party and change mouse controls, we’ve got you covered.
