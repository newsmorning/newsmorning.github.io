Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Fix My Nintendo Switch Screws!

Introduction: 
As a gamer who loves playing on Nintendo Switch, I noticed that my console screws had been worn out due to excessive use. So, I thought of repairing it myself by getting some replacement screws. But what happened next was beyond my imagination. 

Body:
I gathered all the necessary tools and replacement screws and opened up my console to replace them. The process looked easy and I was confident that I would fix it swiftly.

However, everything changed when I tried to remove the first screw. It was stuck and wouldn't budge no matter how much force I applied. I tried using every trick in the book to loosen it up, but to no avail.

I thought of giving up and taking my Nintendo Switch to a professional for repair. But the gamer spirit in me wouldn't let me give up without a fight. So, I kept trying, and after a considerable amount of time and effort, I finally managed to remove the screw.

The next screw proved to be just as stubborn as the first one. I tried the same tricks I used earlier but it wouldn't budge. In my desperation, I applied more force than necessary, and suddenly the screw head broke off. I was devastated.

With a broken screw head, I realized that I needed to approach the situation with a different strategy. After some research, I found a useful tip that would help me remove the remaining screws. I used a rubber band to get a better grip on the screwdriver and applied some heat from a hairdryer to the screws to expand and contract them. Finally, I was able to remove the remaining screws and replace them with new ones.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the process of fixing my Nintendo Switch screws was a challenging experience that taught me a valuable lesson – sometimes, it's best to leave the job to the professionals. However, if you're dedicated and determined enough, you can fix even the most stubborn problems. So, if you're a DIY enthusiast like me, don't give up easily! With some research, patience, and the right tools, you can fix anything.

## Chosen Solution
 I was a bit impatient with trying to fix my broken microSD port on my switch a year ago, and I screwed up. I should’ve waited for dad to get home. I tried to take the back screws off the switch system, but instead I change the shape of the screw and now no screwdriver can fit in there. What do I do to open up my switch?

 Are you saying the screw is stripped? As in the screwdriver can’t get a grip on it? If that is the case, the best way to unscrew a stripped screw is to use a rubber-band.  Put it over the screw and stab the screwdriver into it and it will grip it like a new screw.
