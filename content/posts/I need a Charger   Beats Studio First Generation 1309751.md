 is there anywhere I can purchase a charger for these headphones. I can't find one anywhere.

 Hi Richbaby86,
If you are using the first generation wired edition, it is possible that the headphones are powered by 2 AAA batteries. Follow the instructions here to replace them.
If you are using the wireless edition, the headphones can be charged using any USB charger and a micro-USB cable.
