It’s a great way to give a new lease of life to an older Android device.\nGoogle Assistant Google Assistant is a virtual assistant app that can help you manage and complete tasks on your Android device. From setting reminders and alarms to checking the weather and news, Google Assistant can help you get things done more efficiently. It can even help you locate your phone if you’ve misplaced it!

The app even lets you listen to articles using text-to-speech technology, which can be a great convenience when you’re on the go.\nCCleaner If you find your Android device is running slow or running out of space, then you need CCleaner.
