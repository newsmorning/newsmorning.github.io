Introduction:
If you're an ASUS Q302L laptop user, chances are you've never realized the hidden power switch on the side. Although not technically "hidden" it comes as a surprise to learn that the laptop has a power switch on the side to complement the well-known one on the keyboard. In this article, we will explore this hidden switch and discuss its advantages.

The Hidden Power Switch:
If you're looking at your ASUS Q302L laptop right now, you'll find two switches on different sides of the device. The first switch is located above the keyboard, and it features a small, lit icon of a circle with a line. The second switch is concealed, but it operates the same as the first switch. The printer-like icon in the switch gives a clue to its function, but it's easy to miss, which is why it's often referred to as a hidden or secret button.

Advantages of the Hidden Power Switch:
Now that you know the ASUS Q302L laptop has two power switches, you may be wondering why it's worthy of an article. The truth is that there are countless advantages to the second switch.

For starters, the ASUS Q302L laptop is a 2-in-1 device that doubles as a tablet. As a result, the device may frequently switch from tablet to laptop mode, which can become frustrating if done using the keyboard switch. The side switch makes it easier to toggle between tablet and laptop mode without switching to the keyboard every time.

Secondly, the side switch can be valuable to those who like to travel with their laptops. The keyboard switch can be inadvertently hit, resulting in the laptop shutting down, which isn't ideal for someone working on an important project. The hidden switch minimizes this risk, allowing the laptop to remain on and monitor battery life.

Lastly, the hidden switch may not be as visible as the keyboard switch, but it's much harder to get knocked accidentally. It's protected in its casing, making it more difficult for something to hit it unintentionally and power off the laptop unexpectedly.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the ASUS Q302L laptop has a hidden side switch that is easily overlooked, but it offers several advantages over the more visible keyboard switch. The next time you need to switch between tablet and laptop mode or travel with your laptop, give this hidden switch a try to see how it can make your life easier.

 I need a part number for the physical switch for the power button.  This is number 6 in the asus user manual for Asus Q302L.  Part number or is this included with the top or bottom cover or power usb board?

 Hi,
The part number for the switch might be shown on the switch itself (I donâ€™t know) but it is part of the IO board (part # 60NB05Y0-IO1070 supplier example only)
Search online using the board part number only to find suppliers that suit you best
