Title: Unlocking the Hidden Secrets of Your MacBook Pro 13's SSD Drive: Discover How to Access Your Files Like a Pro!

Introduction:

If you own a MacBook Pro 13, you already know that it is an incredibly powerful machine. From its sleek design to its advanced features, this device is a favorite among professionals and casual users alike. However, there is one area where many MacBook Pro users fall short - accessing their SSD drive.

Despite being an essential part of the device's functionality, many people are unaware of the hidden secrets of their SSD drive. If you want to learn how to access your files like a pro and get the most out of your MacBook Pro 13, this article is for you!

Part 1: What is an SSD Drive?

Before we dive into the details of unlocking your MacBook Pro's SSD drive, it's important to know what it is and how it works. A solid-state drive (SSD) is a non-volatile storage device that stores persistent data on solid-state flash memory. Unlike traditional hard disk drives (HDD), SSDs are much faster and more reliable. They have no moving parts, which means they can read and write data at a much faster rate than HDDs.

Part 2: Understanding the File System

The next step in unlocking your MacBook Pro's SSD drive is to understand how the file system works. The file system is the method your device uses to organize and store your files. It's crucial to know how to navigate the file system to access your files effectively.

The most common file system used on MacBook Pro 13 is Apple File System (APFS). This file system is fast and secure and can be accessed easily by navigating to your device's Finder. The Finder is the default file manager on your Mac, where you can browse, organize, and access your files and folders.

Part 3: Finding Your Hidden Files

Now that you understand the basics of the file system, it's time to learn how to access your hidden files. Sometimes, certain files and folders are hidden from view on your device. This could be due to permissions or other system settings.

To access your hidden files on your MacBook Pro 13, open up the Finder and navigate to your home directory. Once there, press the Command + Shift + Period (.) key combination. This will reveal all the hidden files and folders that are hiding on your device.

Part 4: Enhancing Your Workflow

Now that you know how to access your files and folders on your MacBook Pro 13, it's time to start optimizing your workflow. First, organize your files into relevant folders and subfolders so that you can quickly locate them when needed. Use the search bar to find specific files quickly.

Another way to enhance your workflow is by using the built-in Spotlight search function. This tool lets you search your entire device, including files, folders, and applications, by using specific keywords. To activate Spotlight, click on the magnifying glass icon in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.

Conclusion:

Having a MacBook Pro 13 is a privilege, but to get the most out of your device, you need to know how to access your SSD drive confidently. By understanding the basics of the file system, locating your hidden files, and enhancing your workflow, you can become an expert at accessing your files like a pro. Follow these steps, and you'll unlock the hidden secrets of your MacBook Pro 13's SSD drive in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
Can you please call me Iâ€™m looking for an adapter that allows me to plug in a 2016/2017 non touch bar SSD drive to either a USB-A or USB-C port to read and test drives externally.
I would need about 10 of them.
Apple Blade SSD 5GA 34+22 Pins NVMe

 Sorry we don't call people - To expensive!
Sadly your model uses a very different SSD connector as you can see in this MacBook Pro 13" Function Keys Late 2016 Teardown jump down to Step 10.
So far no one has created one. Give OWC a call to see if they have anything thats the best I can offer you.
Your only option is to get access to another Fn MacBook Pro which you can swap out the SSD to gain access to your files.
