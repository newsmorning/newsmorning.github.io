Is Your MacBook Pro 13 Mid 2010 Acting Up? The Shocking Truth About Its Battery and Ventilator Revealed!

If you are one of the proud owners of a MacBook Pro 13 Mid 2010, then you must be aware of how well this device has served you over the years. However, if you have started experiencing sudden shutdowns, slow performance, or your device gets hot to the touch, then it might be time to look into the root of the problem.

Most MacBook Pro 13 Mid 2010 users experience battery-related issues because the battery on this particular model has a lifespan of only about 1000 charge cycles, which translates to around two years with daily use. If your MacBook Pro is more than two years old, then it's high time you replaced its battery to avoid performance issues.

If you're not aware of how to determine your MacBook's battery cycle count, follow these steps: 

1. Click on the Apple menu on the top left of your screen. 
2. Click on About This Mac.
3. Click on System Report.
4. Navigate to Power in the left pane.
5. Check the Cycle Count under the Battery Information section.

If the number of cycle counts is more than 1000, then it's likely that the battery is the reason behind your MacBook Pro's performance issues.

Moreover, the MacBook Pro 13 Mid 2010 has two vent holes on its bottom side, one at each end. These vents are designed to allow for air circulation within the device, which is necessary to prevent it from overheating. Unfortunately, over time, these vents can become clogged with dust, hair, and lint, which impede proper air circulation leading to overheating.

If you experience overheating, you'll notice the device shutting down suddenly, running at a snail's pace, or getting extremely hot to the touch. To prevent this from happening, you will need to clean your MacBook's vents regularly using a can of compressed air. You can purchase compressed air from any laptop accessories outlet, and you can use it to clean both the vents and the keyboard.

If you're not comfortable opening your MacBook Pro to clean its vents, you can always take it to an authorized Apple service center, where they can clean it up for you.

In conclusion, if you've had your MacBook Pro 13 Mid 2010 for more than two years, it's likely that the battery is the root of your performance issues. Consider replacing it soon to prevent issues from escalating. Additionally, if you notice your device overheating, it's essential to clean its vents regularly to prevent your MacBook from shutting down or getting damaged due to heat. Taking care of your MacBook is crucial to ensure its longevity and smooth operation.

## Chosen Solution
 I bought this macbook on ebay as a replacement for my other 13' unibody - i have no information about its history.  It works perfectly on external power supply (but fans are on full steam).
Apple hardware test detects zero errors. coconut battery shows no values, battery always X out, magsafe always green light, never orange.
I have already swapped the battery, didn't help. SMC reset etc also have no effect.
The previous owner has removed (cut the cable) to the board with the battery charge indicators. I have ordered a new one and replaced it, but this didn't help (and the battery charge is not indicated when i press the button).  I also swapped the magsafe connector board.  My conclusion, this system has a HW fault on the mainboard. Given the SMC is not diagnosed as defect and the machine works overall, I suspect the charging circuit or charge sensing is gone.
Now ... I unfortunately dont have a board view (and no clue where I could buy it) and am trying to identify the resistors around the i625 - as I suspect it could be a charging current detection issue.
Therefore I just had a look at the i625 chip with a magnifying glass and took attached photo. Looking at it, I am wondering if this doesn't look like remainders of some liquid spill.
Any advice here?
- Does this look like liquid spill to you?
- Who can help me to identify which one is the current detection resistor?
Thanks in advance !

 It was sold as working "partly"(i.e. only on external power supply), which is perfectly true. The seller had acquired in a batch and doesnt know the history that's why I am asking if somebody could identify this might have been a liquid spill damage. I believe it should be repairable, given the main components all seem to work well (machine boots and works under external PSU and Apple Hardware Diagnostic finds no fault).
Having listened to Louis YouTube seminars and being an electrical engineer, I am up to take the "brain challenge" of analysing and trying to repair this beast. Now... need some help to the above questions, in particular identifying where the charging current sensing stuff (R7020, R7021, R7023) are located...
