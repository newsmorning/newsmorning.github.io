For years, iTunes has been a staple in the Apple ecosystem and remains one of the most popular ways to listen to music and organize your media library. However, the app has not seen an overhaul in years, and users have been clamoring for a much-needed update. Well, the wait is finally over, and iTunes has received a major update that will change the way you use the app. Here’s why you need to download this update today.\nFirstly, the app has received a major visual revamp. From the moment you open the app, you’ll notice a sleek and modern UI that’s easy on the eyes. The new design makes it easier to browse through your content and find what you’re looking for. The app is now more streamlined, and different features are easier to access. The revamped design also features bright colors that give iTunes a vibrant and contemporary feel.\nAnother reason you need to download this update is that it improves the overall user experience. For years, many people have found iTunes to be slow and clunky. The update, however, makes the app faster and more responsive. You’ll notice that browsing through your media library is a lot smoother, and songs load up faster. The update also brings new features like the ability to search for lyrics, which makes it easier to find the songs you’re looking for.\nThe new update also places a greater emphasis on music discovery. Apple has redesigned the Music section of the app, making it easier to discover new music and browse through different genres. The app also features personalized playlists curated by experts that are tailored to your music taste. These playlists are updated regularly, so you’ll never run out of new music to listen to.\nThe update also makes it easier to manage your media library. The new design allows you to easily add new content to your library and manage your existing content. You can now customize your library views, so you can see the information you want in a way that works for you. The update also brings new sorting and filtering options, making it easier to organize your media according to your preferences.\nOverall, if you’re an iTunes user, this update is a must-download. It brings a fresh new look to the app, improves the overall user experience, and makes it easier to discover new music and manage your media library. Whether you’re a casual listener or a music fanatic, this update is sure to give your iTunes experience a much-needed boost. So what are you waiting for? Download the update today and rediscover your love for iTunes!\niTunes was long overdue for some changes. It’s not the same application it was when it was introduced twelve years ago. When it was introduced, it was only used for playing music on computers and burning CDs. We’ve come a long way since then.\nWe might be burning CDs occasionally in iTunes, but more often than not, we’re content listening to music on our iOS-enabled devices. There’s no need to lug around a case full of CDs. Additionally, we’re watching movies, television shows, and podcasts. We can store it all on our phones or tablets. And for those times it doesn’t all fit, we can store it in iCloud. This means we need iTunes to reflect the new way we’re using it, and this led to the release of iTunes 11.\nVisuals The first thing you’ll notice about iTunes 11 is the visuals. The original iTunes was based around a system that used text for its listings, but more and more visuals were gradually added to it. iTunes 11 now gets rid of most of the textual lists, leaving you with just album covers, movie posters, etc. That left sidebar menu is gone. However, if you’re feeling nostalgic for it, you can always get it back by going to the View menu at the top and selecting Show Sidebar. Otherwise, the only textual menu you will find is the songlist.\nExpanded View As an offshoot of the new visual way to view everything, iTunes now offers an Expanded View of the albums. When you click on an album, it offers an expanded listing of what’s on the album. It’s similar to what you would find in the iTunes Store, without the reviews and the summary. It also offers you a quick link to the Store, just in case you want to buy more music by the same artist or similar.\niCloud While iCloud was implemented in both OS X and iOS earlier, it didn’t really work together as much as it does now. As soon as you download a song or movie from your iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, or computer, it will show up on your other devices. Playlists will all coordinate as well. Add a song to a playlist on the computer, and it will automatically make the change to the playlist on your iPhone. If you have added music from another source, you can sign up for the iTunes Match service, which costs $25 a year, but will allow you to add your music that you rip from a CD to the iCloud service so that you can have it all on all of your devices. iCloud also syncs with the information from Apple TV.\nUp Next If you’d like to plan out what will be on your playlist next, you can use the new Up Next feature. It’s accessed in the right-side of the Now Playing Window. It allows you to delete songs off the list and also allows you to reorder them. You can click on the arrow next to a song for even more information. Clicking on the small clock icon at the top of the list allows you to see the songs that played previously. Click on the plus sign next to the songs to add them in to what’s coming up to hear them again.\nMini Player iTunes has had a Mini Player for quite some time, but now it’s been expanded. The size of it hasn’t been expanded, but the options definitely have been. It is accessed by clicking on the tiny rectangle in the upper right of the iTunes window. You can do just about everything in this tiny little window that you can in the main player. This includes play, forward, reverse, AirPlay, and Search. It also includes an option for the Up Next menu to pop up.\niTunes Store The iTunes Store has been improved as well. If you use iOS devices, though, it doesn’t look very new. It looks nearly the same as the what you see there. The main difference is that instead of having menu choices at the bottom, you have them in a borderless menu on the right. The rest is the same, big graphics of album covers, movie posters, etc. Once you buy anything here, be it music, movies, books, etc., if you use iCloud it will transfer over to your devices.\nMany times we look forward to an application update only for it to not be worth the wait. iTunes 11 was worth the wait, and it’s an update you don’t want to skip over, deciding to just wait for the next one.\nLaura has spent nearly 20 years writing news, reviews, and op-eds, with more than 10 of those years as an editor as well.
