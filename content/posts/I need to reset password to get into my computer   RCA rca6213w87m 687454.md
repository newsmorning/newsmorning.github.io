Once it loaded, I was prompted to select the user account that was locked, and the password recovery process started.

It took almost 30 minutes to complete the process, but once it was done, I was amazed that I could log in without any issues. Everything was back to normal, and I could access all of my files, documents, and applications, just like before.
