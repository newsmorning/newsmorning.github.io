\textbf{SHOCKING REVELATION: iPhone 7's Home Button 3D Touch and Touch ID at WAR - Users Beware!}

The iPhone 7 is undoubtedly one of the best smartphones money can buy today. From the outstanding camera features to the impressive levels of processing power, the device's capabilities are beyond compare. However, recent revelations show that the Home Button's 3D Touch and Touch ID are at WAR, creating issues and inconveniences for users worldwide.

The iPhone 7 Home Button functions both as a Touch ID biometric scanner and as a 3D Touch trackpad. The Touch ID feature is a form of security that allows users to scan their fingerprints to authenticate their identities and unlock their devices. On the other hand, the 3D Touch feature essentially allows users to press harder on the Home Button to activate various shortcuts and menu options.

The issue arises when one attempts to use both functions simultaneously. The Touch ID sensor detects fingerprints via capacitive touch, whereas the 3D Touch sensor detects pressure. It's therefore easy to see how these two features could be in conflict with each other, creating issues for users.

One of the most significant issues is that the iPhone 7's 3D Touch feature may interfere with the Touch ID's fingerprint scanning ability. Some users have reported that, when attempting to scan their fingerprints, the Home Button returns a "Try Again" message, indicating that the Touch ID feature has failed. This is often accompanied by the message "Home Button needs service," thereby rendering the Touch ID feature unusable.

Other issues that arise include unintentional activation of the 3D Touch feature when attempting to use the Touch ID feature. This can be particularly problematic when attempting to unlock the device in a hurry or when attempting to use the device with one hand.

To avoid these issues, Apple recommends that users perform regular maintenance checks on their devices, including cleaning the Home Button and the surrounding area. Users should also ensure that their iPhone 7's Home Button is free from any damage.

In conclusion, the iPhone 7's Home Button 3D Touch and Touch ID features are at WAR, creating issues and inconveniences for users worldwide. While Apple has acknowledged the issue, no official remedy has been issued for affected devices. As such, users are advised to exercise caution when using the Home Button's 3D Touch and Touch ID features simultaneously. Regular maintenance checks are also recommended.

## Chosen Solution
 My phones home button doesn’t appear to be physically broken and the phone has fallen a couple of times. Also 3D Touch isn’t working although haptic is still working. For instance the 3D Touch app switcher Isn’t working and I know that haptic tough doesn’t have that function. Touch ID always shows unable to activate and home button Isn’t working too. The screen doesn’t appear to be broken
but I don’t know if I need to change it

 Hard to answer. how is 3-d touch not working? So something is wrong with the screen too? Or do you just have the setting off? It’s under settings and accessibility. 
In short, you need to open your phone up. Are you willing to do that? 
most likely the home button is disconnected, and can be reconnected very easily. For iPhone 7 it’s easy IF you can open your phone…. If not, it’s probably just the digitizer connection which is still easy. But you have you open the phone. even though the LCD is working, the digitizer (glass) could also just not be connected well anymore. In either case it would suck to open and cost a lot somewhere out somewhere but you could do it yourself if you buy new waterproof seal for when you close it
