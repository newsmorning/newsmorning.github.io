Title: Is Your Vizio TV Playing Tricks on You? Discover The Shocking Truth: Picture Shuts Off But Sounds Still On After Just 2 Minutes!

Introduction:

Vizio TVs are known for their high-quality picture and sound. However, some users have complained that their Vizio TV picture shuts off but sounds still on after just 2 minutes. This issue can be frustrating and confusing.

If you are experiencing this problem, there's no need to worry. In this article, we will explore the causes of this issue and how you can fix it.

Body:

There are several reasons why your Vizio TV's picture might shut off but sound still on. Let's explore them one by one below:

1. Power Saving Mode:

Vizio TVs have an automatic power-saving mode that turns off the screen if there is no user activity. This feature is great for saving energy, but it can be frustrating if you don't want the screen to shut off. 

If you want to disable the power-saving mode, go to the "Picture" menu and select "More Picture." Then, choose "Power Saving Mode" and turn it off.

2. HDMI CEC:

HDMI CEC is a feature that allows devices to control each other over an HDMI cable. If the HDMI CEC setting is turned on, your Vizio TV might turn off the screen if it receives a signal from another device.

To disable HDMI CEC, go to the "System" menu and select "CEC." Then, turn off the "CEC Function" setting.

3. Cable Connection Issues:

If your HDMI cable is not connected properly, it can cause the screen to turn off while the sound continues to play. Make sure that the HDMI cable is plugged in properly and is not damaged.

4. Factory Settings:

If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider restoring your Vizio TV to its factory settings. This will erase all of the settings and data on your TV, so make sure to back up your data before proceeding.

To reset your Vizio TV, go to the "System" menu and select "Reset & Admin." Then, choose "Reset TV to Factory Settings" and follow the on-screen instructions.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, if your Vizio TV's picture shuts off but sounds are still on, it can be due to a number of reasons including the automatic power-saving mode, HDMI CEC, cable connection issues, and factory settings. By following the steps outlined in this article, you should be able to fix the issue and enjoy your Vizio TV without interruption.

## Chosen Solution
 I'd be curious what the resolution to this was. My 65" Vizio started doing the same exact thing which is turning on and operating fine and then after 2 minutes, the picture turns off and sounds continues.
