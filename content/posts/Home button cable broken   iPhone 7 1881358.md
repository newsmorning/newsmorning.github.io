# OMG! Your iPhone 7 Home Button Cable is Broken and You Won't Believe the Crazy Consequences!

If you're an iPhone 7 user, you're probably aware that the home button is a crucial part of the device. It's not just for unlocking your phone, but it's also a shortcut key to perform different functions such as opening Siri, multitasking, and taking screenshots. However, imagine if your iPhone 7 home button cable is broken - this could lead to some serious and unexpected consequences.

First and foremost, you won't be able to use your home button. That means you won't be able to unlock your phone, go back to the home screen, or access various apps easily. This alone can be frustrating enough, but the problems don't end there.

Without a functioning home button, you will have to rely on the Assistive Touch feature, which can be accessed in the settings. However, this feature is not only cumbersome but can also be a real pain to use. The Assistive Touch window sits on top of other apps, which can make it difficult to navigate.

Additionally, some apps may not function properly without a working home button. For instance, some banking apps require the use of Touch ID to authenticate transactions. With a broken home button, you won't be able to use this feature which, in turn, may prevent you from accessing your account or making transactions.

Moreover, a broken home button cable also means your phone's warranty may be voided. Attempting to fix the issue on your own or visiting an unauthorized repair shop can further worsen the problem and increase the chances of damaging your phone.

In some cases, a broken home button cable may also interfere with your phone's battery life. The constant strain on the device can lead to faster battery drain, which is not only inconvenient but can also affect the longevity of your phone.

In conclusion, a broken home button cable on your iPhone 7 can lead to a myriad of problems. It's essential to get it fixed by a certified technician to ensure that you don't face any of the above-mentioned consequences. Don't let a small issue turn into a big one; take action immediately to avoid any further damage to your device.

## Chosen Solution
 When repairing my screen i broke the cables of the home button is there a way to fix this or can I send it to a repair factory or something.

 It is possible that an experienced technician (with microsoldering experience) may be able to fix the flex cable. This repair may be quite expensive.Any new home button wouldnâ€™t work as the button is paired to the motherboard. In the worst case scenario you will just have to use Assistive Touch.
