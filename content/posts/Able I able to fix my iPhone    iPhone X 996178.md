# You Won't Believe the Hacks to Get Your iPhone X Back On Track - Find Out If You're Able to Fix it Yourself!

The iPhone X is undoubtedly a magnificent device that redefined the smartphone industry with its advanced features like edge-to-edge OLED display, facial recognition, and wireless charging. The iPhone X made its market debut in late 2017 and since then it has been a favorite of many. However, owning a high-end phone comes with its challenges, especially when it’s not performing up to expectations. There can be many reasons why your iPhone X is not working as it should, but before you rush to the Apple store to get it repaired, consider these hacks to get your iPhone X back on track.

## Restarting your iPhone X

The first step to take when your iPhone X is not performing well is to restart it. It might seem like a basic solution, but it is a powerful hack that works most of the time. Restarting your iPhone X clears the memory and closes all running apps, and this can help to fix minor software glitches. To restart your iPhone X, hold down the power button and either of the volume buttons until the “slide to power off” bar appears on your screen. Swipe the bar to the right to shut down your iPhone X.

## Updating your iPhone X

Apple regularly releases software updates that fix bugs and enhance the performance of its devices. It’s important to keep your iPhone X up to date with the latest software updates to ensure optimal performance. Updating your iPhone X is easy, go to your settings and select General then Software Update. If there is an available update, your phone will prompt you to install it. Remember, it’s important to back up your device before installing any updates to avoid losing any important data.

## Checking storage space and deleting unnecessary content

A full storage space can slow down the performance of your iPhone X. It’s ideal to keep at least 1GB of free space on your phone to allow it to perform optimally. To check how much storage space you have left, go to settings then General, tap on iPhone Storage. You can then free up space by deleting unnecessary photos, apps, and files from your device.

## Resetting your iPhone X

If none of the above hacks works, resetting your iPhone X to its factory settings may help. However, it should be your last resort because it will erase all data from your iPhone X including photos, music, and videos. Make sure to backup everything on your iPhone X to avoid losing important data. To reset your iPhone X, go to settings, then General, scroll to the bottom and tap Reset then Erase All Content and Settings.

In conclusion, your iPhone X might not be performing well because of minor software glitches or low storage space. Restarting, updating or resetting your phone are just a few hacks that can help to get your iPhone X back on track. If all else fails, it’s advisable to visit an Apple store or an authorized service provider for assistance. Remember to always back up your iPhone X before attempting any significant hack.

## Chosen Solution
 Ive had my iPhone for awhile, one day I dropped it on the corner of my phone ( my phone already had cracks on the screen but nothing big.) After dropping it I had a crack on my screen, I didn’t use it for the rest of the day and the next day it started jittering and basically having a mind of its own. Opening apps really fast and typing random letters. Is there something I can do to the phone its self to fix this? I’ve been having this problem for about 6 months.

 it’ll likely need a screen replacement
