Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Fix Your Ring Spotlight Cam From Turning On - Just 5 Simple Steps!

If you've recently purchased a Ring Spotlight Cam, you may have experienced the frustration of it turning on at all times of the day and night. This can be brought on by a multitude of things, such as incorrect settings or malfunctioning hardware. But don't worry, fixing it is easier than you think! In just 5 simple steps, you can have your cam back to functioning properly.

Step 1: Update the Firmware

The first step is to check for updates on your cam's firmware. You can do this by opening the Ring app, clicking on your device and then selecting "Device Health." From there, click on "Firmware" and if an update is available, select "Update Firmware." This will ensure your Ring Spotlight Cam is running on the latest version with bug fixes and improvements.

Step 2: Adjust the Motion Settings

One of the reasons your cam may be turning on at all hours is due to incorrect motion settings. Within the Ring app, navigate to "Motion Settings" and adjust the range and sensitivity of the motion detection. You can also set up scheduling so that the cam is only active during certain hours of the day.

Step 3: Reset the Cam

If the first two steps don't work, it's time to do a hard reset on your cam. Press and hold the setup button for 20 seconds, then release it. Your cam will then power cycle and reset. This will clear any saved settings and may fix the issue.

Step 4: Check for Interference

Another possible problem is interference with your Wi-Fi. Make sure your cam is placed in a location with a strong Wi-Fi signal and away from other electronics that may be causing interference. A slow or weak signal can cause the cam to turn on and off, even when it's not needed.

Step 5: Contact Ring Support

If none of the above steps work, it's time to contact Ring support. They have a knowledgeable team of experts who will be able to diagnose and fix any hardware issues that may be causing the problem. They can also help walk you through any additional troubleshooting steps.

In conclusion, fixing your Ring Spotlight Cam from turning on at all hours of the day is a relatively easy process. By updating the firmware, adjusting motion settings, resetting the cam, checking for interference and contacting support if necessary, you'll have your cam working perfectly in no time. Follow these simple steps and you'll be back to enjoying the security the Ring Spotlight Cam provides in no time!

Using a Ring spotlight cam is a great way to increase your home security. Still, like any other technology, these cams aren’t impervious to technical issues. When your Ring cam won’t load past it’s start up faze, or it won’t turn on at all, what are you supposed to do? 
 
To answer this question for you, we’ve gathered 5 troubleshooting steps you can take right now to pinpoint the problem and fix it. So, if you want a chance to get your Ring spotlight cam back on, keep reading! 
 
## Check the That the Batteries Are Functioning and Charged
 
Oftentimes the simplest solution is the right one. At the very least, starting with simple solutions can help you quickly narrow down what the problem is and how severe it is. 
 
With that in mind, you should start by ensuring the batteries are functional and charged. It’s best to simply allow the camera to charge for a couple of hours and then return to it to see if it’s working. 
 
Additionally, you can check the battery compartment for debris and signs of battery corrosion if it doesn’t seem to be holding a charge. 
 
If it turns out however, the batteries are not functioning or in the hatch properly, and you’ve either replaced them or put them back in the right way, you’ll need to give them time. What we mean by that is you should wait ten minutes for them to reset before you check to see that the spotlight is functioning properly.  
 
## Check the Outlets Near Your Cam if It’s Wired
 
If you have a wired Ring spotlight cam, you should check to see that the outlet you have it plugged into is receiving power. If it isn’t you can try resting your circuit breaker to see if the problem resolves.
 
## Set Up Your Ring Cam and Uninstall/Reinstall the App
 
If the camera will come on but it won’t make it past setup, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the app, then going through the process of reconnecting the Cam. When you set up the camera, you should have it nearby your router just to ensure that there isn’t any connectivity issues. 
 
## Rest Your Spotlight Cam to its Factory Settings 
 
The final way to potentially resolve the issue with your cam yourself, is to reset it to its factory settings. Assuming all the hardware is functioning properly, and you can at least get it to power on, even if nothing else happens, this should make your camera function as if you just took it out of the box. 
 
Below we’ve laid out each of the steps involved in resetting your Ring Spotlight cam: 
 
- Power on your spotlight cam and hold down the reset button for about 30 seconds before releasing it. Even if it doesn’t actually fully boot up, you should be able to do this as long as the power light come on. Wait to see if the light on the camera flashes to indicate that it is actually resetting. If the light doesn’t flash, try again to double check that you didn’t hold the reset button down too long or too short.

 
If resetting your Ring spotlight cam doesn’t work, or you couldn’t try it because your cam won’t receive any power at all, you may have a hardware problem. 
 
## If Nothing Works Check Your Warranty
 
If none of the above steps were able to work for you, the problem may be too technical to take care of without familiarity and training about how the cam actually works. 
 
Fortunately, Ring devices all come with a one year warranty when you buy them. On their site, Ring states the warranty will “repair or replace any Ring products that malfunction due to defective parts or workmanship at no charge.” 
 
If you’ve bought your Ring camera in the last year, you should take advantage of the warranty and get 
 
## So, How Do You Fix a Ring Spotlight Cam That Won’t Turn On?
 
First you should determine whether your problem is that it won’t turn on at all, or that it won’t make it past the start up. If it won’t turn on at all, you should first check its source of power. If it’s a wired model make sure that the outlet it’s plugged into is receiving power. If it’s wireless, ensure it has full batteries and that they’re functioning. 
 
If it’s just not turning on in the sense that it won’t make it past startup, your best bet is to either uninstall and reinstall the app, then reconnect the cam, or do a full factory reset. If even that doesn’t solve things, check and see if the 1 year warranty on your cam is still active. Ring will either repair or replace your device based on which option makes more sense with the given problem.
