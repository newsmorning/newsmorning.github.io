# Is Your iPhone SE at Risk of Liquid Damage and a Blown Backlight? Find Out Now!

Are you the proud owner of an iPhone SE? Do you rely on it for everything from staying connected to managing your daily tasks? If so, then you're not alone. Millions of people around the world use iPhones every day, making them one of the most popular mobile devices on the planet. 

But as we all know, iPhones are not invincible. They can be damaged by simple accidents such as drops, bumps, and knocks. And two of the most common problems that can occur are liquid damage and a blown backlight. In this article, we'll take a closer look at these two issues and how to prevent them from happening to your iPhone SE. 

## Liquid damage 

One of the worst things that can happen to your iPhone SE is liquid damage. This happens when water or other liquids seep into the device and damage the delicate parts inside. Once this happens, the phone may stop working altogether, or its various functions might be severely impaired. And unfortunately, the iPhone SE is not immune to this type of damage. 

So, how can you prevent liquid damage? The first step is to be careful with your phone around liquids, especially water. Avoid leaving your phone near open containers of liquid, and never use it in the rain or near swimming pools. If you do get your phone wet, be sure to dry it off immediately and avoid using it until it has completely dried out. 

Another way to protect your phone is to invest in a water-resistant case. These cases create an extra layer of protection that can prevent liquids from seeping into your phone. And finally, consider purchasing a wireless charger for your iPhone SE. This means you won't need to plug it in, which reduces the risk of liquid damage. 

## Blown backlight 

The backlight is what illuminates your iPhone SE's screen so you can see what's on it. However, this component can blow out due to various reasons such as voltage fluctuation, a fall or impact, or just wear and tear over time. When your backlight blows out, your screen will be dim and difficult to see. 

To prevent a blown backlight, try to avoid dropping your phone and keep it away from extreme heat. High temperatures can cause the backlight to overheat and burn out more quickly. You may also want to invest in a protective case with cushioning or shock absorption that can absorb some of the impact from a fall. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, iPhone SE owners must be aware of the risks of liquid damage and a blown backlight. However, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of these problems. Be careful around liquids, invest in a water-resistant case, and consider a wireless charger. And protect your phone from drops and extreme heat to avoid a blown backlight. 

By following these tips, you can ensure that your iPhone SE stays in excellent condition and will last as long as possible. Remember, prevention is always easier and cheaper than repair, so take care of your phone, and it will take care of you.

## Chosen Solution
 Alright guys, so I am working on an iPhone SE. It got a little wet, wet enough to the point of when they brought me it, the screen would not work. The rest of the phone you could tell worked (they had the phone turned on!!). So I cleaned the logic board up, took the shields off of course and then reassembled with a new screen and only half of the screen worked. One side of the screen would work fine, the other side had lines going through it and it was a little black. So I got another screen and tried again with the same results. I posted to here about it and they told me I might have gotten a bad batch. So I ordered a more expensive screen that was a lot better and now when I plug ANY screen into it, it stays as a black screen but all of the chips are getting hot.
I am assuming I have a bad back light filter or diode. The only problem is, I can't find anything on this phone. I want to find the back light components, but there isn't much online showing me where to find them. Any one have any advice on where to find them or what could even be the problem?
I am pretty sure about this because I do it every time I test a screen but I will ask anyway! I do not have the metal plate on the back of the screen on, I am only plugging in the screen itself so the digitizer and LCD, and also the home button to see if I could do HOME + Power, but ended up with the same results.
Does the board have to be mounted to the enclosure for it to work? Because I put the board in the enclosure but I do not screw anything down, I just connect the cables to their connectors so I can test. And like I said, the board is getting hot, and when I plug a charger into it, it gets very hot.
Any help will be much appreciated!

@gigabit87898 I don't think this is underfill, this looks differently. The white stuff could be corrosion but I can't get it off! I took a picture of both using my cell phone and the microscope, its not the best picture but does show you what I am talking about. Did you find anything out from the other pictures I sent? Here is the up close microscope shots of them http://imgur.com/gallery/9xBcG. Do you have any suggestion on how to better clean a board? +

 Did you clean the board? Clean it with isopropyl alcohol, and see which chips are getting hot. Please provide a picture so we can see which components are burnt.

 @jetlabbelectro

the component in question here is reference designator C3418_RF which is a 2.2UF 4V x5R ceramic capacitor in a 0201 package. It is part of your Baseband circuitry.  Best way of cleaning your board would be with an ultrasonic bath. If you do not have it available follow the direction given above.
@gigabit87898 sure you do....;-) check your email.

 wow, how much have you blown on this repair already ?? btw i had a similar issue while repairing my old iphone 5 (replacing battery and ribbon cable for volume) there were lines / strings vertical which dissapeared after screwing in the board and pressing it a bit.  don't ask me why. was afraid i've blown the screen but the problem went away.  it happened to me actually twice, with the lines on the screen
