If you are one of the unlucky users with a sticky back panel on your Pixel 4A, we have some fantastic news for you: a revolutionary adhesive replacement solution has arrived! For months, Google has been investigating the issue, and they have finally found a solution that can put an end to the frustrating problem once and for all.

The sticky back panel issue has been a significant problem for Pixel 4A users. The issue was first reported in early 2021 and quickly spread throughout the community, with countless users complaining about the difficulty of opening their devices. The issue also made it hard to put the phone into a case or keep it clean.

To address this issue, Google has developed a new adhesive replacement program that allows users to replace the original adhesive on their Pixel 4A with a stronger and more reliable adhesive material. This new adhesive material will stick better to the back panel, making it easier to remove and put it back on again without having to worry about the stickiness.

The program involves users sending in their affected Pixel 4A for repair. Google will then carefully remove the back panel, clean the old adhesive off, and apply the new adhesive. This process is done free of charge, including shipping and handling costs.

To ensure that users do not experience the same issue again in the future, Google has also made some changes to the manufacturing process of the Pixel 4A. The new adhesive solution will be incorporated into the manufacturing process, so all future models will be free of any sticky back panel issues.

This solution is a significant breakthrough for Google and the Pixel 4A community. The company has taken user feedback seriously and developed a practical solution to fix the sticky back issue. The new adhesive replacement program ensures that users can continue to use their Pixel 4As without any inconvenience, and the changes made to the manufacturing process will guarantee that future models will also be free of this issue.

In conclusion, say goodbye to Pixel 4A's sticky situation forever with this new revolutionary adhesive replacement program from Google. If you're experiencing the dreaded sticky back panel issue, do not hesitate to reach out to Google to take advantage of this free-of-charge solution. With the new adhesive in place, you can now use your Pixel 4A without any issues or frustration.


## Chosen Solution
 Hello everyone,

It was snowing  and family insisted in video call while I had a walk. so a lot of humidity got inside my phone. Right now a very distinct strip of the touchscreen doesn’t work well or at all (I can see some dots with the tester but it’s rare) and some of outer 1mm of the screen.

So I want to clean up the connector with some alcohol. Got a ifixit kit, it’s gonna be great even for my laptop maintenance (no more ruining old cards)

Any advises on what adhesive to use to close the phone back up? I saw there’s a pixel 3a “frame” adhesive thingie, but there’s nothing for 4a.

I saw this on amazon uk but I don’t even know if I choose 1mm, 2mm or 3mm or even if it’s good.

 If there is no pre-cut adhesive available you’ll have to resort to those tape rolls like you linked. I would suggest you to get a few different sizes because there are some places where a bigger strip might be appropriate, and other places where you’ll need the smaller sizes (on the thin edges for example). I don’t recommend to only go for a large size and trying to cut it smaller since that generally doesn’t work well.
Ifixit carries 1mm 2mm 4mm 8mm Tesa tape in their store: Tesa 61395 Tape which is a well renowned brand.
My personal collection also has 3mm and 5mm but I think you’ll do fine with a few or all of the sizes that ifixit caries. 8mm might not be suitable for mobile phone repairs though :-)
I also had a quick scan on eBay & AliExpress but none of them seem to have the pre-cut adhesive for the Pixel 4A unfortunately.
