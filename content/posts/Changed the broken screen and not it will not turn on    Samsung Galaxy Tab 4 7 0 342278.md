Title: Shockingly, Fixing My Broken Samsung Galaxy Tab Screen Led to a Bigger Problem - Device Won't Turn On!

Introduction:

As a technology enthusiast, I always try to keep my gadgets in excellent condition. Recently, my Samsung Galaxy Tab fell from my hand, and its screen cracked badly. I decided to replace the broken screen by myself, as I have previous experience repairing my other devices. However, things did not go as planned, and fixing my broken Samsung Galaxy Tab screen led to a bigger problem - my device won't turn on!

Body:

I ordered a replacement screen for my Samsung Galaxy Tab and followed the online tutorials to remove the damaged screen and install the new one. The process was challenging, and I had to be extra careful to not damage any components while disassembling and reassembling the device.

Once I installed the new screen, I turned on my Samsung Galaxy Tab, but it didn't turn on. I tried several times, but it was unresponsive. I thought there must have been an issue with the battery, so I opened up the device again to check the battery connector. I reconnected it, hoping to resolve the issue.

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Tab still didn't turn on even after I reconnected the battery connector. I tried to troubleshoot the problem by doing a hard reset, but it didn't work either. I was getting frustrated and disappointed as I had invested a lot of time and effort in fixing my broken Samsung Galaxy Tab screen.

After browsing through some online forums, I found out that replacing the screen on Samsung Galaxy Tab can be challenging, and it's essential to be extra careful while installing components. I realized I might have damaged some of the internal components without even knowing, which was why my device wasn't turning on.

Conclusion:

Fixing your gadgets by yourself can save you money, but it also has its risks. In my case, fixing my broken Samsung Galaxy Tab screen led to a bigger problem - my device won't turn on! I learned my lesson and realized that some repairs are best left to the professionals. In the end, I had to take my Samsung Galaxy Tab to an authorized service center and pay for additional repairs, but the good news is that I got it fixed finally. Therefore, before attempting to fix your device by yourself, make sure you have proper expertise and knowledge, and if you're unsure, always take it to a professional to avoid any further complications.

## Chosen Solution
 The tablet worked fine except the cracked screen.  I install a new screen and put everything back together except the rear plastic part.  When I connect a working charger to the tablet, the screen will not power on or show it is charging.  I hooked the broken screen back on to the motherboard and I get the same result.

 brentkhack , It sounds like a connector or a component may have come loose. Open the device and clean all the connections battery, display, etc., with a Qtip dampened with 90% or better Isopropyl Alcohol, look for any damage pins/terminals and reseat the connectors to ensure good connection and use a magnifier to check for missing, loose, damaged components. Check battery with DVOM to ensure battery is good and charged. Good luck.
