A few months ago, my Windows 10 computer suddenly started displaying the dreaded "Critical Structure Corruption" error, commonly known as the BSOD or the Blue Screen of Death. It was frustrating, to say the least. Every time I tried to use my computer, it would either freeze or crash, forcing me to reboot manually.

After several days of trying to fix the issue, I finally found a few simple fixes that saved my computer from the BSOD error. In this article, I will share with you these nine easy-to-follow steps that could help you fix the same problem.

1. Update Windows 10

The first and most obvious fix is to ensure that your Windows 10 is updated to the latest version. Microsoft frequently releases updates to fix known bugs and issues that could prevent your computer from functioning properly.

To check for updates, click on the Start menu, then navigate to Settings > Update and Security > Windows Update. Click on "Check for Updates," and if there are any available updates, download and install them.

2. Check for hardware issues

Hardware issues such as a faulty hard drive or RAM can cause the BSOD error. To check if there are any hardware problems, go to "Control Panel," then click on "System and Security" and look for "Administrative Tools." Click on "Event Viewer," then check for any critical or error events in the "System" or "Application" logs.

If you find any critical or error events, it might indicate a hardware problem. Try running a hardware diagnostic tool to diagnose any hardware problems.

3. Uninstall problematic drivers or software

Some drivers or software could conflict with each other or with the operating system, causing the BSOD error. To check for problematic drivers or software, go to "Device Manager" and look for any devices with a yellow exclamation mark or a red X. Uninstall the faulty drivers or software, then restart your computer.

4. Run System File Checker

System File Checker (SFC) is a tool that scans and restores corrupted system files. To check for and repair corrupted system files, go to "Command Prompt" as an administrator, then type "sfc /scannow."

5. Disable Fast Startup

Fast Startup is a feature that helps Windows 10 start up quickly, but it could cause BSOD errors. To disable Fast Startup, go to "Control Panel," then click on "Hardware and Sound." Click on "Power Options," then click on "Choose what the power buttons do." Click on "Change settings that are currently unavailable," then uncheck "Turn on Fast Startup."

6. Run a virus scan

Viruses, malware, and other malicious software can cause the BSOD error. To scan for viruses, use a trusted antivirus program, then run a full system scan.

7. Update drivers

Outdated drivers could also cause the BSOD error. To update your drivers, go to "Device Manager," then right-click on the device you want to update and select "Update Driver Software."

8. Restore to the previous version of Windows 10

If you recently updated your Windows 10, the update could have caused the BSOD error. To restore to the previous version of Windows 10, go to "Settings," then click on "Update and Security." Click on "Recovery," then click on "Get started" under "Go back to the previous version of Windows 10."

9. Reset Windows 10

If all else fails, you can reset Windows 10. This will reinstall Windows and delete all your personal files, programs, and settings. To reset Windows 10, go to "Settings," then click on "Update and Security." Click on "Recovery," then click on "Get started" under "Reset this PC."

In conclusion, these nine simple fixes saved my Windows 10 from the BSOD error. Try these fixes, and you might be able to save your computer from the same issue. Remember to back up your data before trying any of these solutions to avoid losing important files.

There is no such thing as a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) error that isn’t scary. Still, “critical structure corruption” has to be one of the most scary-sounding errors we know of. 
 
Don’t panic! While this fatal error can indicate a serious problem, it’s not as if your computer is going to suddenly go up in flames. Take a deep breath and work through the various troubleshooting options below.
 
## What Is a Fatal Error (BSOD)?
 
If this is your first tangle with the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (officially a “fatal error”) then it deserves a brief explanation. These are errors that Windows can’t correct and, if left alone, will lead to data corruption and other serious system damage or instability.
 

 
So, on the one hand, a BSOD is a good thing because your computer is trying to help you be proactive in protecting the system. On the other hand, it means that something is wrong. That problem can be trivial or difficult to fix, but it does need attention.
 
Many of the fixes for this particular BSOD overlap with those for other fatal errors. So it’s definitely worth checking out our general BSOD troubleshooting guide.
 
## What Causes the Critical Structure Corruption BSOD?
 
It’s not entirely clear what causes this error. However, it’s certainly either related to hardware failure of some sort or, less seriously, a problem with a driver. In either case, rogue changes are being made to the structure of the Windows 10 kernel which triggers the fatal error.
 
That’s a specific effect with a vague and wide range of potential causes. Still, we should find a way to narrow it down with the basic steps below.
 
## 1. Make a Note of Recent Changes
 
While it’s entirely possible that fatal errors can happen because of hardware going wrong in the background, it’s more likely it’s being caused by a recent change in your system. 
 
So it’s worth making a list of recent changes that you’re aware of and starting your troubleshooting journey with those changes. Either by rolling them back or using them as a way to narrow down the likely origin of the issue. Things to look out for include:
 
- New hardware or new hardware drivers.New applications installations.Recent Windows updates.

 
Correlation does not mean causation, but a blue screen error closely following one of these types of changes is enough to warrant a look.
 
## 2. Boot Into Safe Mode
 
If you want to figure out whether a driver or other startup application is responsible for this error, it can help to boot Windows 10 into Safe Mode. In Safe Mode only a generic set of drivers is loaded and none of the custom startup crud that most of us have built up after a while loads into memory.
 
If you still get the Critical Structure Corruption error despite being in Safe Mode, it’s more likely that there’s a hardware cause behind your woes. If you don’t know how to boot into Safe Mode check out How to Restart Windows in Safe Mode.
 
## 3. Perform a Clean Boot
 
Safe Mode strips Windows down to the barest essentials, to make sure you get a stable environment for troubleshooting. However, there’s a different boot mode that assumes Windows itself isn’t the issue. Instead, a clean boot leaves Windows alone and disables all third-party startup apps and other customizations. This is a good way to figure out if the BSOD is being caused by something in Windows itself or by a third-party app.
 
Performing a clean boot is slightly more complicated than Safe Mode. So if you want to try it for yourself, check out Perform a Clean Boot in Windows 7/8/10 for detailed instructions.
 
## 4. Unplug USB Devices
 
When troubleshooting errors such as these, it’s always a good idea to remove as many variables as possible from the equation. So unplug every USB device you don’t absolutely need. 
 
Usually that means everything except for your keyboard and mouse. If the BSOD stops, add devices back one by one until it happens again. This should provide a clue as to which devices might be responsible.
 
## 5. Uninstall Misbehaving Applications
 
There seem to be a certain subset of applications that are known to cause the critical structure corruption error. They don’t do this for everyone and they probably work just fine most of the time.
 
Which applications? We’ve seen anecdotal reports of applications such as Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools causing this BSOD. So if you have these applications installed or ones that have a similar level of system access or functionality, try uninstalling them.
 
## 6. The Common Culprit: Display Drivers
 
Based on the various cases we’ve seen with this BSOD on the internet, it seems that faulty display drivers are often the cause. Which means that one potential fix is to uninstall your current display driver and reinstall the latest one. 
 
When we say “uninstall” we really mean it though. Display drivers are notorious for not properly removing themselves from your system, which is actually one of the reasons they cause problems to begin with. This is why you should use DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller). It’s best thing to do is to uninstall the driver in safe mode and then install your new driver as new software.
 
## 7. Undo Overclocking
 
This is a step we recommend for just about any fatal error that happens on a PC. If any of your components such as the GPU, CPU, or RAM are running beyond their rated specifications, switch them back to stock settings first before doing any other troubleshooting.
 
## 8. Hardware Testing
 
Hardware failure can be a source for almost any BSOD, and Critical Structure Corruption is no different. So it’s worth running a few hardware diagnostics to make sure it’s not a failing component.
 
Start by running the Windows disk checker on each of your drives. If there are bad sectors or the SMART reporting system indicates a pending failure, you’ll find out this way.
 
While it’s probably not a problem with RAM, it’s a good idea to run the Windows Memory Diagnostic from time to time anyway.
 
## 9. Check System Files
 
The System File Checker (SFC) in Windows is one of the best general-purpose troubleshooting steps you can take whenever it seems that Windows itself is wonky. What it does is cross-checks all of your system files to make sure they aren’t corrupt or incorrect. If a broken file is found, SFC will replace it with a fresh copy.
 
To use SFC, all you need to do is:
 
- Right-click on the Start ButtonSelect Windows Powershell (Admin)

 
- Type sfc /scannow and press Enter

 
If the process completes with no errors, then you know it wasn’t a corrupt system file.
 
## Critical Fail?
 
We hope that after trying these troubleshooting tips your critical structure error has disappeared. However, if it comes back or you simply can’t find the reason it’s happening, there’s always the nuclear option.
