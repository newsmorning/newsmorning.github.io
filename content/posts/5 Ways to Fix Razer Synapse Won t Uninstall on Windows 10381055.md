If you're one of those users who want to remove Razer Synapse from their Windows 10 system, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll discuss the five simple tricks to remove Razer Synapse on Windows 10.

The first method to remove Razer Synapse is to use the default uninstaller that comes with the software. To do that, open the Start menu, type "Control Panel," and click on the first result. Once you're in the Control Panel, click on "Programs and Features," find Razer Synapse in the list of installed programs, right-click on it, and select "Uninstall." Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

2. Use Third-Party Uninstaller Software

If the default uninstaller doesn't work, you can try using third-party uninstaller software like Revo Uninstaller or IOBit Uninstaller. These tools can help you remove Razer Synapse and all its associated files and registry entries completely. Simply download and install a third-party uninstaller software, select Razer Synapse from the list of installed programs, and let the software do the rest.

3. Use PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful command-line tool that can help you uninstall Razer Synapse from your Windows 10 system. To use PowerShell, open the Start menu, type "PowerShell," and select the first result. Once you're in PowerShell, type the following command:

Get-AppxPackage *RazerInc.RazerSynapse* | Remove-AppxPackage

Press Enter to execute the command, and wait for PowerShell to remove Razer Synapse from your system.

4. Use Registry Editor

If you're comfortable editing the Windows Registry, you can remove Razer Synapse manually using Registry Editor. To do that, press the Windows key + R, type "regedit," and press Enter. Once you're in Registry Editor, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall and look for the folder named {D4D0-83ED-4ABF-8EFE-1F099EF7B42E}. Right-click on the folder and select "Delete" to remove Razer Synapse from the list of installed programs.

5. Use a System Restore Point

If all else fails, you can use a system restore point to revert your Windows 10 system to a previous state when Razer Synapse wasn't installed. To do that, open the Start menu, type "system restore," and click on the first result. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a restore point and let Windows restore your system.
