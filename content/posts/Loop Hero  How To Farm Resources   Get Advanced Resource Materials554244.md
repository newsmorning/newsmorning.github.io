# Uncover the Secret Loop Hero Farming Method for Rare Advanced Resource Materials!

If you are someone who loves playing RPG or strategy games, Loop Hero must have caught your attention. Loop Hero is an addictive game that involves building and customizing your own game board to fend off enemies and earn resources. However, resources are not easy to come by! That's where the secret farming method comes in.

In Loop Hero, one of the most valuable resources you can get is the advanced resource materials. These materials are essential to crafting advanced items and upgrades. However, they are rare, and getting them through normal gameplay can take up a lot of time and effort.

Fortunately, there is a secret farming method for advanced resource materials in Loop Hero. This method involves a specific loop composition with a few specific requirements.

The key to this farming method lies in understanding how the game's algorithms work. The algorithm in Loop Hero is programmed to generate a certain number of resources based on your loop composition. The resources generated depend on the attributes of the tiles on your loop.

To get the most out of this farming method, you need to create a specific loop composition. The composition should be circular, with tiles that generate high-level monsters. The tiles that generate high-level monsters should be surrounded by tiles that generate low-level monsters.

Once you have set up your loop, start battling the monsters. Continue the battle until you have generated the maximum amount of resources. The resources generated depend on the number and level of monsters you defeat.

Be patient while farming for advanced resource materials. It may take some time before you start seeing results. However, once you have optimized your loop composition and have a good understanding of the game's algorithms, you will be able to farm rare advanced resource materials reliably.

In conclusion, farming for advanced resource materials can be a daunting task in Loop Hero. However, with the right loop composition and understanding of the game's algorithms, it is possible to farm rare resources efficiently. So, go ahead and give this secret farming method a try if you want to take your Loop Hero gameplay to the next level!

Loop Hero combines all the best elements of retro games. It will take you to the old days when you had your 16-bit Fantasy RPG. The gameplay might feel nostalgic, but the idea of the loop is something different from other games. You do not control your hero directly in this game. Your goal is to create a path and fill the world with different elements, which your hero on auto exploration mode loops around again and again.  You also need to build and upgrade buildings to progress in-game. This requires a lot of different types of resources. The environmental changes you add determines the health and attack stats of both your hero and the enemies. So today let’s look at how to farm resources in Loop Hero.
 
## How to Farm Resources in Loop Hero?
 

 
To farm first three main Resources (Stable Branches, Preserved Pebbles, and Rations
) in Loop Hero you need to do the following:
 
- Build as many Groves along the loop, to collect the most number of Branches. Collecting 12 stable branches will convert them to a single Stable Wood.
 - Preserved Pebbles can be collected by placing both Rock tiles & Mountain Tiles along the path. But the best way to get them is to travel through Cemeteries in your loop. Collecting 10 Preserved Pebbles will convert them to a single Preserved Rock.
 - Ration can be collected by putting down Meadow tiles. Collecting 12 Rations will convert them to a single Food Supply.

 
These three resources are going to be your best bet to getting all the first advanced materials. Following the above steps will now give you Stable Wood (12 Stable Branches), Preserved Rock (10 Preserved Pebbles), and Food Supply (12 Ration). Now let’s look at other resources if you are a bit ahead of the game, like if you have already beaten the first boss The Lich. We will be covering them soon. They are:
 
- Book of Memories (10 Memory Fragments)
 - Metamorphosis (20 Noticeable Change)
 - Orb of Afterlife (10 Pitiful Remains)
 - Orb of Craft (10 Craft Fragments)
 - Orb of Expansion ( Kill above 4 foes in a battle)
 - Orb of Immortality (Beat The Lich)
 - Orb of Unity (10 Shapeless Mass)
 - Stable Metal (13 Scrap Metal)
