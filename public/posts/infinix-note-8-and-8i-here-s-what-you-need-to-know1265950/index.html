Are you in search of the ultimate smartphone that stands out from the crowd? Look no further than Infinix Note 8 and 8I!\nReleased in 2020, Infinix Note 8 series has taken the world by storm, offering users the perfect combination of stunning design, innovative features, and killer performance. Whether you are looking for a device for gaming, work, or entertainment, Note 8 and 8I are the ultimate game-changers you can’t afford to miss.\nHere is what makes both devices stand out:\nDisplay Both smartphones come with large screens for immersive visuals, Note 8 has 6.95 inches display while Note 8I has 6.78 inches display. They sport FHD+ resolution, 90Hz refresh rate, and an exceptional screen-to-body ratio of 90.1%. This means you can enjoy sharp and crystal-clear visuals with vibrant colors, whether you’re watching movies, playing games, or scrolling through social media.\nPerformance Infinix Note 8 series is powered by a Helio G80 chipset, which offers blazing-fast performance and efficient power consumption for prolonged use. They come with 6GB RAM ensuring excellent multitasking and 128GB internal storage, enough space to keep all your files in one place. With this CPU, you can expect smooth and seamless performance while running graphics-intensive applications or playing heavy games.\nCamera The camera on the Infinix Note 8 and 8I is truly impressive. They have a 64+2MP back camera setup and a 16+2MP ultra-wide front camera setup, which captures stunning images and videos. The advanced camera features like the super night mode, Time-lapse, and slow-motion allow you to capture moments in a more creative way.\nBattery The battery life on both devices is exceptional, boasting a massive 5200mAh battery to keep you powered all day without the need to find a power outlet. And when you do need to charge, the 18W fast-charging ensures that the device will be quickly juiced up.\nDesign Infinix Note 8 and 8I have a unique design that stands out from the crowd. The devices have a stunning infinity-o display and come in three unique colors: Silver Diamond, Deepsea Luster, and the latest version still giving customers more options to pick from. The physical feel of the Note 8 series when held in hand is also unmatched, it is one of the sleekest and stylish smartphones in the market.\nPrice Lastly, note 8 and 8I are affordable devices that pack impressive features. These devices are budget-oriented with prices in the market ranging between $220 and $250 depending on the retailer. So you can get the best value for your money without breaking the bank.\nOverall, Infinix Note 8 and 8i are the ultimate game-changers in the smartphone world. From its stunning design to its remarkable performance, camera and battery life, both devices offer everything you need and more. If you’re in the market for a smartphone that stands out from the crowd, Infinix Note 8 and 8I are the perfect match for you. Don’t hesitate to get your hands on these game-changing smartphones today!\nIt feels like Infinix is launching a new device every other day. And yes, that’s kinda true. In the past few months, we’ve seen the Infinix Zero 8, Infinix Hot 10, Infinix X1 TV among others.\nInfinix has just announced yet another device coming. This time, the successor to the Infinix Note 7 launched earlier this year.\nIn a bunch of early teasers aimed at drumming up excitement for this device, we get a glimpse of what to expect in the soon to be launched device. Well, devices.\nAccording to reports, Infinix is planning to launch not just one, but two devices in the Note 8 lineup. These are the:\nInfinix Note 8Infinix Note 8i Read More: Infinix Note 7 Review: A supercharged gamer’s dream\nSee, the Infinix Note 7 received glowing reviews from various quarters including us. So, how does Infinix plan to follow that act with the Note 8 series?\nThe Note 8 series, from what we gathered, is a slight improvement from the Note 7 series. Here are the specs for the Note 8 from what we know so far.\nInfinix Note 8 Key Specs Perhaps one of the disappointing aspects of this specsheet is the display. HD+ resolution span out across close to 7-inches results in a pixelated experience as we pointed out in our Note 7 review.\nWhile this is acceptable, we were hoping to see at least a 1080p panel. What is not disappointing is the USB-Type C port. It is good to see Infinix sticking to this modern connector.\nThe 5200mAh battery paired with the lower resolution display should result in respectable battery life, an aspect where Infinix Note devices have been known to dominate.\nIn the camera department, the Note 8 sports a dual selfie shooter with a 16MP primary lens and a 2MP portrait sensor. At the back, there’s an array of 4 lenses; a 64MP main, a 2MP Portrait, another 2MP for Macro and an ‘AI Camera’.\nPricing and Availability The Infinix Note 8 family of devices should be available in the country soon but pre-orders are already open starting October 12.\nTo be among the first people to get this device when it drops, you need to visit an Infinix Store with KES 3,000 (down payment). When the device is available, pre-orderers will get a gift hamper with their units worth KES 5,000.\nWe still don’t have an official RRP but if history is anything to go by, the Note 8 should start at around KES 21,000.\nWe shall update as soon as we get more inf\nRelated ","wordCount":"935","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Donald Neves"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-note-8-and-8i-here-s-what-you-need-to-know1265950/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Infinix Note 8 and 8I: The Ultimate Game-Changing Smartphones You Can't Miss!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 11, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;935 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Donald Neves</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#display>Display</a></li><li><a href=#performance>Performance</a></li><li><a href=#camera>Camera</a></li><li><a href=#battery>Battery</a></li><li><a href=#design>Design</a></li><li><a href=#price>Price</a></li><li><a href=#infinix-note-8-key-specs>Infinix Note 8 Key Specs</a></li><li><a href=#pricing-and-availability>Pricing and Availability</a><ul><li><a href=#related>Related</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=infinix-note-8-and-8i-the-ultimate-game-changing-smartphones-you-cant-miss>Infinix Note 8 and 8I: The Ultimate Game-Changing Smartphones You Can&rsquo;t Miss!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#infinix-note-8-and-8i-the-ultimate-game-changing-smartphones-you-cant-miss>#</a></h1><p>Are you in search of the ultimate smartphone that stands out from the crowd?
