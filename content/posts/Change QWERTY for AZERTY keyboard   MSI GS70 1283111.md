Are you tired of using the same old QWERTY keyboard, and feeling like your typing speed and accuracy could be better? Have you ever considered switching to the AZERTY keyboard layout? If you own an MSI GS70, you're in luck, because this gaming laptop has the option to switch to the AZERTY layout. In this article, we'll explore the advantages of switching to AZERTY, and how to do it on your MSI GS70.

AZERTY is a keyboard layout commonly used in France and other French-speaking countries. It's similar to QWERTY in that it has letters and numbers in the same places, but some of the letters are swapped. For example, the A and Q keys are swapped, as are the Z and W keys. This might seem like a small change, but it can make a big difference in your typing speed and accuracy.

One of the main advantages of AZERTY is that it's optimized for typing in French. The French language has a lot of accented letters and diacritical marks, and AZERTY makes it easy to type them quickly and accurately. If you're someone who frequently types in French, switching to AZERTY could save you a lot of time and frustration.

Another advantage of AZERTY is that it can be easier on your hands and fingers. QWERTY was designed to slow down typing speed to prevent typewriters from jamming. However, this design also means that some of the most commonly used keys are in hard-to-reach places, which can cause strain on your hands and fingers over time. AZERTY, on the other hand, has some of the most commonly used letters in easier-to-reach places, which can make typing more comfortable and efficient.

If you're ready to switch to AZERTY on your MSI GS70, it's a simple process. First, go to your keyboard settings and select "AZERTY" as your keyboard layout. You may also need to physically switch out the keyboard if you have a model that doesn't allow for switching between layouts. Once you've made the switch, it may take some time to get used to the new layout, but with practice, you'll be typing faster and more accurately than ever before.

In conclusion, if you're looking to unlock your true typing potential and improve your typing speed and accuracy, switching to the AZERTY keyboard layout on your MSI GS70 could be the way to go. With its optimized design for French typing and easier-to-reach keys, AZERTY could help make typing more comfortable and efficient. Give it a try and see how it works for you!

 Hey
I wonder if it is possible to change the QWERTY keyboard of the MSI GS70 Stealth Pro with an AZERTY one.
How would I be able to do that? Where to order? How to replace?
At this moment this is my most pressing concern in buying the device.
Kind regards

 Hi
Thank you for your answer. I have been searching too and I found that MSI is selling them with azerty keyboards: MSI GS70 2PE-044BE
The 044BE is Belgian country code.
The QWERTY version on amazon is around 400eur cheaper. I figured for that price I can order an azerty replacement keyboard and install it myself. Do you think that will work? Where would I be able to buy such a replacement keyboard?
Besides, the keyboard has transparent glowing letters. Putting stickers on it would kill that feature.
Kind regards

 you can simply tell windows its a different type but chicklet keys on laptops break easily so you dont want to try to physically move them around, my best suggestion is find stickers of some type to change the lettering

 Hi,
I owned  an MSI GS70 Stealth for 3 years. It came with an AZERTY (FR) keyboard. Last month, some keys became not working. I went to the local computer store to change the keyboard. They  are selling MSI laptops, that's a reason for which I went there, but they told me they were unable to find this kind of keyboard. I paid 40 EUR they refund me. I had to buy another laptop (not MSI).

 Usually, you can try to change the whole keyboard. it's safer than changing separate keys, but more in-depth than using stickers.
MSI provides guides for the complete teardown of their machines, as a PDF, with photos, references parts number, references for each screw, and torque applied to each screw (it's far more that you would expect from any teardown guide xD )
You model seems to be chassis MS1771 : https://forum-en.msi.com/faq/uploads/172...
From here, you can search for an AZERTY keyboard which matches your part number. Although I can somewhat recommand Aliexpress because they're basically the open doors of all chinese factories, you may want to take a closer look to you regular shops around you ! For my MSI laptop (a CX61-2PC, so the chassis reference is MSI16GB), I could find an AZERTY keyboard replacement at a local store in Rennes, France. Peel down every page on Google with the part number you're searching for, and you may find a store near you where you can order a new keyboard ! (I had an extreme luck living in Rennes and having that precise shop in Rennes that could order my keyboard, and for a smaller price than what I found on Aliexpress !)
(you may find that part number while looking at Aliexpress beforehand, I already had the part number because I had to change my keyboard for the same one, it was dead).
I know this topic is 2 years old but maybe somemone passing by will read this and be grateful. I hope it may help someone ^_^
