## How can I fix the Epic browser on Windows 10?
 
### 1. Try a different browser
 
If you value the confidentiality of your data and have a particular interest in preserving your online activities anonymous and untraceable, you would not want to miss the chance to use Opera, the browser with the utmost concern for privacy.
 
This privacy-focused browser offers everything that Epic Privacy Browser has to offer and more. Having undertaken a complete overhaul, Opera is built as a powerful, but lightweight browsing solution that doesn’t use too much of your resources.
 
Boasting some special features such as a built-in VVPN tool to anonymize your browsing history and an integrated adblocker to keep invisible trackers at bay, you can be sure that whatever you do online remains strictly your business and yours alone.

 - Select System and Security, then Windows Defender Firewall.
 - In the left side-panel select Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off.

###  4. Flush DNS
 
- In the Windows search box type cmd, right-click the first result, and select Run as Administrator. If you can’t run Command Prompt as an administrator, check out our guide on how to fix it.
 - Then type: ipconfig /flushdns
 - After the process is over, you will see the Windows IP Configuration Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache.

 
### 5. Get a new IP address

### What can I do if the Epic Privacy browser VPN is not working?
 
You should know that, if pages aren’t loading or the proxy is very slow, it could be that the server you’re connected to is either down or overloaded. 
 
###  Opera 
 
  Reimagine browsing ad-free with Opera with the utmost concern for privacy!  
 
If you face a similar situation, you have to try changing your proxy country or try closing and re-opening Epic to connect to a different server.
 
Furthermore, if you are connected to a certain country, but the website says that you’re not in that country, close then re-open Epic to connect to a different server for that country.
 
So, now you now have the answers for problems such as the Epic browser not installing, the Epic browser installer not working, or even the Epic privacy browser proxy not working.
 
That’s it. If you followed the steps closely, your Epic Privacy Browser should now work without any problems on Windows 10.
