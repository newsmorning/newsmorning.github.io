And even so, for some that have functionalities on the twitter app.\nThis post covers 5 twitter bots that help users have a better experience on the platform. The handles of these bots are listed, alongside their functions.\n5 Twitter Bots You Should Know About 1. QuotedReplies You know how you see a tweet and want to see other people that have quoted that particular tweet? Well, QuotedReplies does this quite easily. By mentioning the bot handle, @quotedreplies, it provides you with a link. Via this link, you can view all the quotes of a particular tweet. For this to work, you have to mention the handle as a reply under the original tweet.\n2. Thread Reader App Because Twitter threads can be tedious to read sometimes, this bot helps you read them more easily.

To get this, you have to mention the Twitter bot handle @threadreaderapp together with the “unroll” keyword. And you get your link.\n3. ThisVid Twitter themselves, have not provided a way to download videos on the platform. However, this Twitter bot has. ThisVid is a bot that helps you download twitter videos.

Such that subsequently, once you mention the handle under a video, you just have to check the link to get download access.\n4. RemindMeOfThis In case you want to be reminded of a particular tweet at any time, the handle @RemindMe_OfThis is the right bot handle to mention.

Block Together To help better deal with trolls on the platform, or restrict the content you want to see, @blocktogether helps you block twitter accounts.
