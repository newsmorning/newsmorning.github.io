# Discover the Ultimate Secret Weapon for Keeping Your Emails Safe and Secure with These Top 4 Anonymous and Private Email Services!

In this digital age where privacy is becoming a major concern, it's essential to make sure that all of your online interactions are kept safe, especially your email conversations. Sending personal and sensitive information through email can pose a significant risk to your cybersecurity, setting you up as the prime target for cybercriminals. The good news is, you can protect yourself and your emails from prying eyes by using anonymous and private email services that can keep your conversations encrypted and secure.

Here are the top 4 anonymous and private email services that can help you keep your emails safe and secure.

## 1. ProtonMail

ProtonMail is a secure email service that offers end-to-end encryption, meaning your emails are always protected, and no one can read them, not even ProtonMail. Also, your messages are not only encrypted, but the metadata such as sender, receiver, and timestamps are also encrypted. Your emails are stored in Swiss data centers, which are known for high security and privacy standards, making it a compelling option for anyone who values their privacy.

## 2. Tutanota

Tutanota is another secure email service that offers end-to-end encryption, and it's entirely open-source, meaning anyone can verify its security implementation. Tutanota also provides zero-knowledge encryption, hence they cannot read your emails, and your data is always safe. Additionally, Tutanota allows you to send encrypted emails to non-Tutanota users, providing you with extra privacy protection.

## 3. Hushmail

Hushmail is an encrypted email service that uses OpenPGP encryption, which is a popular standard for secure email communication. Hushmail encrypts your emails with an encryption key, which only you can access, making it impossible to access your emails without the decryption key, providing you with an extra layer of security. Moreover, Hushmail has an intuitive interface that makes it user-friendly, even for beginners.

## 4. Mailfence

Mailfence is an encrypted email service provided by Belgian company Contact Office. Mailfence provides end-to-end encryption and is compliant with both the United States' HIPAA and Europe's GDPR data privacy regulations. It's a web-based service that is accessible from any device, and it includes features like digital signatures, custom domain support, and two-factor authentication.

In conclusion, using a secure and anonymous email service is a perfect way to keep your messages safe and your privacy intact. The services listed above offer an extra layer of protection that ensures you're communicating safely with your contacts, and your emails are always secure. If you're looking to keep your emails private and secure, try using the above-listed services, and safeguarding your online privacy with just a click.

Email is a wonderful invention, but it’s also become a bit of a burden. Sometimes you may want to send a message without revealing who you are. At other times, you might want to sign up for something online, without having to endure the subsequent barrage of spam messages.
 
The good news is that there are a number of excellent anonymous and private email providers. Many of them are also temporary mailboxes, which means you can’t use them as your primary email. 
 
However, when you need to get the word out without also giving away your identity or getting your message intercepted,  you should look no further than one of these fine privacy-focused tools.
 

 
## Guerilla Mail
 
Guerilla Mail isn’t the most attractive web tool out there, but it is one of the quickest ways to send and receive mail anonymously. You don’t need to sign up for an account and can immediately make use of a disposable mailbox.
 
The main idea is that you use one of their temporary addresses to sign up for stuff. You can confirm your subscription in the Guerilla Mail inbox and then banish it to the ether. Now your real email address will be mercifully free of spam emails, or worse.
 
You can also send emails anonymously and there
is even a beta feature to attach small files, up to 150MB in size.
 
You may be thinking that using a disposable address might make it hard to do things like reset a password. In this case however, your disposable email address will remain forever, until you choose to click “forget me” that is. 
 
The only potential downside is that someone might guess your mailbox name, which would give them access. So use a strong, random string of characters as provided by Guerilla Mail itself.
 
It’s a great free service that may need a little
polish, but definitely gets the job done.
 
## Mailinator
 
Mailinator has a great name, but it’s also backed up by a cool little service. Unlike Guerilla Mail, Mailinator email boxes are public and will auto-delete their content after a few hours.
 
You can’t send any emails with the service and all boxes are public. So you should not use it to receive emails that will contain personal information such as your real name. 
 
This is a tool aimed specifically for those times you want to get past a wall that asks for your email, i.e. a download that requires an email. This is not for opening accounts or other long-term commitments. If you want permanence and privacy, they do offer a paid subscription as well.
 
### ProtonMail
 
ProtonMail is free, but it requires that you sign up for an account. This means it’s not anonymous in the sense that the provider itself has information on you. So you have to trust the people behind ProtonMail when it comes to protecting your privacy. 
 
The company is, however, based in Switzerland, which is known for its strong privacy laws. They use end-to-end encryption as well, which means that even ProtonMail doesn’t know the content of your emails.
 
It’s based on Open Source technology, so it’s been checked for hidden code and back doors by a community of independent contributors. To top it all off, ProtonMail doesn’t keep any logs, so no one can associate you with your ProtonMail account. It’s one of the most polished products here and an important tool in your personal privacy kit.
 
Just remember that, unlike the previous two services we looked at, ProtonMail protects your identity from outside snooping, but not from the person you send the message to, unless you refrain from registering using your real name, something we don’t recommend. 
 
## Mailfence
 
Mailfence is a lot like ProtonMail. It’s a proper cloud-based mail service that offers strong protection against your identity or message content being leaked. It’s important to note that if you register with your real name, the person who you message will see that name. 
 
This service protects your emails from outsiders. So don’t use it to send messages anonymously unless you are also using a made up name. If you want MailFence to also protect your identity from recipients, then don’t give it any real information about yourself!
 
In terms of features, it’s a little more
technical than ProtonMail, but also offers more fine options to control your
experience. If you opt for a paid subscription, you also gain access to useful
functions such as aliases and additional email domains.
 
## It’s All About Priorities
 
In this modern day and age, few things are as valuable as your privacy and the choice to be anonymous if you want to. These four email services will help you keep unwanted eyes off your private correspondence or simply provide a way to get past annoying email spam walls. Either way, the power is now back in your own hands.
