# Don't Replace Your Asus Rog G53Sw Xt1 Motherboard Until You Read This - Shocking Solutions Revealed!

Gamers around the world love the Asus Rog G53Sw Xt1 for its exceptional performance and solid built. However, one common problem that plagues this gaming powerhouse is the motherboard issue. It’s quite frustrating to see your gaming rig not running up to its potential due to motherboard problems.

But, before you rush to replace the motherboard of your Asus Rog G53Sw Xt1, read this article. We are here to share some valuable solutions that may help you fix your motherboard problems and save you a lot of money. 

## Diagnosing the Problem

The first step towards fixing any computer problem is diagnosing it. Don't jump to conclusions that your motherboard is faulty without properly diagnosing the issue. Here are some common symptoms that your Asus Rog G53Sw Xt1 motherboard might be suffering from:

- The device doesn't boot at all
- The screen remains blank, or there are lines/distortions on it
- The device beeps continuously during startup
- The device shuts down frequently, or its performance declines

If you’re facing any of these issues, try these solutions before going for a motherboard replacement:

## 1. Clean the Motherboard

Sometimes dust and dirt can accumulate on your motherboard and cause components to short-circuit or malfunction. A thorough cleanup of your motherboard may help restore its functionality. Before commencing any cleaning activities, ensure that the device is turned off, and you have all the necessary equipment to clean the motherboard.

## 2. Check the Power Supply Unit

There is a possibility that the problem with your motherboard may be due to the power supply unit. If your power supply unit is not supplying enough power, it may cause your motherboard to malfunction. Use a multimeter to test the output of the power supply unit.

## 3. Reseating Memory Modules

Loose memory modules could also cause motherboard issues. Re-seat all the memory modules and check if it makes any difference. If you find any problems with the memory module, replace it.

## 4. Update the BIOS

The BIOS is the heart of your motherboard, and updating it may help fix the issues. The new firmware version comes with bug fixes and functionality improvements that could potentially solve the motherboard problems. Check the motherboard's website for firmware updates and make sure you follow the update procedure precisely.

## 5. Replace the CMOS Battery

The CMOS battery is responsible for maintaining the state of the BIOS settings. A dead battery could be the root cause of the motherboard problem. Replacing the CMOS battery with a new one may help fix the issue.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a motherboard replacement should be your last option. Before you jump to the conclusion that your motherboard is faulty, spend the time to diagnose and try the above-mentioned solutions. These solutions may help you save quite a bit of money and save your Asus Rog G53Sw Xt1 from the graveyard.


## Chosen Solution
 I made a mistake with updating the BIOS for the laptop and the computer won't turn on so I think I will need to replace the motherboard. Any information on how to do that myself or if there is someone else more experienced with computers than me that could do it would be of help

 According to a post I read, you can downgrade your BIOS to an earlier version.  You can read what the person said here:

Some computers allow you to downgrade the BIOS, while others don't.  Apparently this person was successful in doing this.
If you can downgrade the BIOS, that is definitely the way to go.  Changing a motherboard is major surgery on a laptop.  (On a desktop also, but especially so on a laptop.)  There are lots of tiny, fragile things that can easily break when you are doing this. Tiny screws can get lost or mixed up.  And you can easily short something out with static electricity by touching something with your bare hands.
If you decide that you need to replace the motherboard, then watch several YouTube videos about people swapping the motherboard on the same laptop that you have, before attempting it yourself.  Also, see if Asus or anyone else publishes instructions for replacing the motherboard on your laptop.  Having instructions is invaluable, and I would not proceed with changing the motherboard without having some instructions, if it was my first time to do so.
You will need an anti-static wrist band.  Something like this:

You will also need some cleaner, some q-tips, and some thermal paste (see below), a can of compressed air, and plenty of table space.
And you will need a new CMOS battery to replace the one currently in the laptop.
You should also get a poster board and a note pad.  The poster board is for putting screws and other parts.  When you do step 1 (for example, remove the back cover), you will put the screws on the poster board and draw a rectangle around them.  And write in the top of the rectangle, "Step 1 - screws from the back cover".  You will also write down exactly what you did on your notepad: "Step 1 - I removed the back cover.  There were 12 screws.  etc."  And take plenty of pictures, and maybe some videos of things, because you can record your voice in the video: "Step 1 -- I removed the back cover.  These two screws were big, the rest were small" -- and you will point to those screws in the video.  You may not need all of the pictures and videos, but if you do, they will be a life saver.
As you are proceeding, move slow, not fast.  Be super careful in everything you do.  And don't force anything.  If it won't disconnect easily, then you aren't doing it the right way.
When you get to the CPU, remove the heat sink, clean the surface of the heat sink and the CPU with cleaner (Arctic Silver ArctiClean), apply new thermal paste (Arctic Silver Thermal Paste) on the surface of the CPU, and reattach the heat sink.  Blow out all dust with a can of compressed air.
Change the CMOS battery while you have the laptop disassembled.
