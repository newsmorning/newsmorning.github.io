When people think of smartphones, one of the first names that comes to mind is undoubtedly LG. The company has been a major player in the mobile phone industry for years and is known for producing high-quality, innovative devices. However, even the best products can have some mysterious secrets.

Recently, a teardown of the LG G5 was conducted, and what was found inside was shocking. As the team began disassembling the device, they noticed that something was missing: a small piece that typically sits near the battery. While this may seem like a minor issue, it ended up being a critical problem with the LG G5.

So what was this mysterious missing piece? According to experts, it's a small bridge that connects the battery to the motherboard. Without this essential component, the phone cannot function properly. Interestingly, it appears that LG intentionally omitted this piece from the design of the G5. And this has raised many questions about the company's intentions.

Why did LG leave out this crucial component? What effect does it have on the performance of the phone? No one knows for sure, but some experts are suggesting that it may have been a cost-saving measure. Others speculate that LG may have intended for users to replace the battery themselves and connect the bridge on their own. But until LG issues an official statement, it's all just speculation.

Regardless of the reason behind this missing piece, it's safe to say that it has made an impact on the LG G5's performance. Users have reported issues with the phone's battery life, and some have even experienced overheating. It's clear that this was not a wise move on LG's part.

In conclusion, the mystery behind the missing piece in the LG G5 may never be fully solved. However, what is certain is that the absence of this component has had a significant impact on the phone's performance. As consumers, it's important for us to take a closer look at the products we use and question why certain design choices are made. Who knows what other secrets may be lurking just beneath the surface?

phone and a black part fell out I can't seem to find its origin

 photos would help as nobody can tell what you mean by just saying a black part fell out

This piece comes from where the two screws hold the back plate to the screen assembly. If you look at the right hand bottom of the back plate when it is on the table inside facing up, you will see a small casting on the bottom right hand corner. This piece straddles that casting with its hole  in the direction from where the attaching screw is inserted. Hope this helps.
