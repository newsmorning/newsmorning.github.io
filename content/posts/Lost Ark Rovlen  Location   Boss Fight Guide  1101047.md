Uncover the Secret Location of Lost Ark's Rovlen Boss and Dominate the Fight with this Epic Guide!

Are you tired of failing to defeat Rovlen Boss in Lost Ark? Do you often find yourself struggling to locate the secret entrance to the boss’s lair? Fear not, for this epic guide will help you uncover the secret location of Rovlen Boss and give you the tools you need to dominate the fight.

The first step to defeating Rovlen Boss is finding its lair. To accomplish this, you need to locate a hidden entrance located in the Ashen Highlands region. The entrance is well-hidden, meaning you have to be attentive to the environment around you. Keep an eye out for a large boulder with a crack in it. Jumping on the boulder will cause it to break, revealing the entrance to the lair.

Once inside the lair, you will be greeted with a series of dangerous obstacles that you must overcome to reach the main chamber where Rovlen Boss awaits. Be aware of the numerous traps scattered throughout the lair. These traps can either deal significant damage or even outright kill you if triggered. Use your agility and quick thinking to navigate through the traps.

When you reach the main chamber, Rovlen Boss will be waiting for you. The boss has several attacks that you need to be aware of, so it's essential to have a strategy to defeat it. Rovlen Boss shoots beams of energy that can deal significant damage, but these beams also create cracks in the floor that you can use to your advantage. By altering your positioning frequently, you can trigger these cracks and create a series of fissures that will inflict extra damage on Rovlen Boss.

Another important aspect of defeating Rovlen Boss is knowing when to dodge. The boss has a charging attack that you need to avoid by moving out of the way quickly. Using your character's dodge ability at that moment is crucial to avoid taking damage. Be careful not to overuse your dodge ability, as it will leave you vulnerable if you miss-time it.

Dealing significant damage to Rovlen Boss will require excellent weapons as well. Make sure to equip weapons that deal high damage against this boss, and don’t forget to use your character's skills to inflict extra damage. Use your best judgment to put together a loadout that will work best against this boss.

In conclusion, Rovlen Boss is a formidable boss in Lost Ark, but by using this guide, you'll be able to uncover the secret location of its lair and dominate the fight. With a keen eye for traps, quick thinking, and the right gear, you'll be able to stand toe to toe with Rovlen Boss and emerge victorious. Good luck!

## How to Beat Rovlen World Boss in Lost Ark?
 
### 
 
Rovlen in Lost Ark cannot move around as it is a plant, rooted in the Earth. But that doesn’t mean it cannot attack you. It can deal with long-range attacks as well as AOE close-range attacks. To deal with it you will need to be kitted to the teeth and have a few team members. Why do you ask? that’s because Rovlen in Lost Ark has over 1.5 Million Hitpoints. That is a lot of health and you will need all the help that you can get.
 
Since it can deal with both close-range & long-range attacks, you will have kit around it and attack at the right moments. Be out of its range and you should do just fine. If you have bulky team members, use them to tank shots while both of you deal damage. This tactic should work even if you are a bit under-leveled. Be careful as it will do a large AOE attack that comes from underground. But you will be able to dodge it A-OK. After you defeat by dealing over 1.5 Million damage in total, you will gain a lot of loot like Silver, XP, Major Healing Potions, Tangled Aeon Necklace, Hunter’s Pursuit Gloves, Hunter’s Pursuit Chestplate, & other such loot.
 
This was all about Finding & Defeating Rovlen in Lost Ark. Hopefully, this guide has helped you. You can also check out our guides on The Salt Giant Boss Fight in Lost World.
