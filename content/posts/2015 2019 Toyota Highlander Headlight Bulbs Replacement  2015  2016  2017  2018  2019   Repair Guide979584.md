# Say Goodbye to Dark Roads! Discover the Ultimate 2015-2019 Toyota Highlander Headlight Hack for Clearer, Safer Driving in 5 Easy Steps!

Driving at night or in low-light conditions can be challenging, especially if your headlights are not providing adequate illumination. This can make it difficult for you to see the road ahead, navigate sharp turns, and avoid potential hazards. Poorly performing headlights put you and your passengers at risk of accidents, which is why it is essential to ensure that your headlights are working correctly.

The 2015-2019 Toyota Highlander is a popular mid-size SUV with impressive performance and a comfortable interior. Although this vehicle comes with excellent headlights, over time, they can become dim, making it challenging to drive at night. Fortunately, there is a headlight hack that can help restore the brightness of your headlights, creating a safer driving experience.

## Step 1: Gather the Required Materials

Before beginning the headlight hack, you will need to gather the materials required to complete the task. The items you will need include:

1. Toyota Highlander Headlight Cleaning Kit
2. Water
3. Soap
4. Microfiber towel
5. Automotive masking tape
6. Electric drill
7. Sandpaper, varying grits (800, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500)
8. Clear coat spray paint
9. Rubbing compound

## Step 2: Remove the Headlights

To start the headlight restoration, you will need to remove the headlights from your 2015-2019 Toyota Highlander. To do this, open the hood and locate the back of the headlights. Detach the electrical connector and remove the headlight. You may need to refer to your ownerâ€™s manual or consult an automotive expert if you are unsure how to remove the headlights.

## Step 3: Clean the Headlights

Once you have removed the headlights, clean them with soap and water to remove any dirt, grime, or debris. Use a microfiber towel to dry the headlights thoroughly after washing them.

## Step 4: Sand the Headlights

Using your electric drill and sandpaper, begin sanding the headlights in a horizontal direction. Start with grit 800 then move to grit 1000, 1500, 2000, and end with grit 2500. Be sure to keep the sanding pad flat as you sand to ensure an even result. When sanding, ensure that you remove every bit of the haze or cloudiness from the headlight.

## Step 5: Apply Clear Coat Spray and Rubbing Compound

After the sanding process is complete, it's time to apply the clear coat spray to protect the headlights' surface. Use the automotive masking tape to protect any surrounding areas from overspray. Alternatively, you can cover the rest of the car with a large piece of cardboard if you prefer. Once the clear coat dries, apply the rubbing compound to buff the headlights. This will help to remove any remaining scratches or imperfections, leaving you with crystal-clear headlights.

With this headlight hack, you can now enjoy safer and clearer driving in low-light conditions. If you don't feel confident completing the process yourself, seek assistance from an automotive specialist. With clear headlights, your 2015-2019 Toyota Highlander will be easier to drive at night, making your travels safer and more enjoyable.
