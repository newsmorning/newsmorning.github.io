## Chosen Solution
 Hi, My 3 year old integrated fridge freezer (AEG) has a freezer issue, its not getting cold anymore unless I activate the frostmatic function, this gets it to about -8 but as soon as it clicks off frostmatic it warms up again to 1 deg. opened it up behind the drawers, fan is spinning and no ice build up. HELP!

 This is a total SWAG. The unit has 2 cooling systems, so the refer is functioning. The freezer cooling system is functioning since the Frostmatic is cooling down below set value. Therefore, the problem must be in the normal freezer temp control. Either it is set too high or it is not functioning properly because the sensor or the control circuit is defective. Which one it is u will have to determine with troubleshooting and elimination.
