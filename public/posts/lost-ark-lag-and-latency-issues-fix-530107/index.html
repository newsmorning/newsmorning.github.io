However, like most online games, it’s not immune to latency issues that can ruin the gaming experience. Lag spikes and latency issues can make the game frustrating, unplayable and can even cause the player to lose battles. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem!\nThe Ultimate Fix for Latency Issues\nOne of the most common reasons for Lost Ark’s latency issues is the player’s location. Players located in different parts of the world experience different levels of latency. This is because of the distance between their location and the game server. The farther the player is from the server, the higher the lag they will experience.\nTo overcome this issue players can connect to a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN is a secure and encrypted network that creates an encrypted tunnel between the player’s device and the game server. This makes the player’s internet connection secure and lowers the latency. Additionally, a VPN can change the player’s virtual location, allowing the player to connect to a server closer to them.\nChoosing the Right VPN for Lost Ark\nChoosing the right VPN can be complicated, as not all VPNs provide the best services. Selecting a VPN with low latency, high speed, and optimized servers for gaming can bring the player’s gaming experience to the next level. There are various factors to consider when choosing the right VPN for Lost Ark.\nFirst, check the VPN’s latency rate. A VPN with a low latency rate can reduce the lag a player experiences during the game. Second, find the VPN with servers located near the game server. Third, ensure the VPN has a fast connection that won’t slow down the player’s game. Lastly, check if the VPN allows P2P traffic for downloading and uploading game files.\nConclusion\nLost Ark is a stunning game with amazing graphics, but due to latency issues, it can ruin the gaming experience. Finding the right VPN can help solve the latency issue and lead to a more enjoyable and smoother gameplay experience. The right VPN can lower latency, speed up internet connection, change virtual locations, and provide an overall better gaming experience. So, players around the world, don’t let lost Ark lag hell ruin your game. Add a VPN to your gaming strategy and play the game like a pro!\nWhile players are enjoying exploring the lands of Arkesia, it’s quite a bummer to receive random lags while playing Lost Ark. It’s annoying when the reason for death in-game is because of a lag spike, much relatable. What’s more frustrating is when the game suddenly kicks you out and disconnects the ongoing game. Ever since its release, the reviews for Lost Ark saw a shift from overwhelmingly positive to mixed reviews. The errors and the lags might be the reason for the switch of reviews by the players. Not to worry, here’s our guide on how to fix the lag spikes and high latency issues in Lost Ark.\nHow to Fix Lag and Latency Issues in Lost Ark? Check servers Before you go through any of the potential fixes, check the servers of Lost Ark.\nYour game servers can be down due to daily or weekly maintenance breaks for the updates.\nSelect your region and check the status of the server. You can check the server status by going to their website.\nIf the servers are down, wait for some time until the downtime period ends.\nThis will save up a lot of your time as there’s not much you can do apart from waiting.\nIf the servers are up and yet you are facing these issues, try out the next fix.\nTroubleshoot your Windows firewall Press Windows + R key and type “firewall.cpl“\nAs it will open the settings for your Windows firewall, click on allow an app or feature option through the firewall.\nCheck whether Lost Ark is in the allowed apps list.\nIf it does not show up, click on allow another app option.\nBrowse and locate the launcher of Lost Ark.\nThen, press Add option to allow it.\nCheck and mark both the options of private as well as the public networks.\nThis might resolve your high latency issues.\nLaunch the game to check whether the issues persist or not.\nIf they do persist, follow the next method.\nClear out the apps taking up your bandwidth Hit the Ctrl + Del + Alt button to open task manager. Click on the network option to check the apps or software taking up your bandwidth. Then, clear out these ongoing and the background tasks with the end task. Restart your router Unplug all the wires connected to your router. If your router has a battery, remove it to shut it down. Wait for 30 seconds and then connect all the wires back online. Verify your Files Integrity Launch the Steam and go to the Games Library. Right-click on the Lost Ark and select the properties option. Select the Local Files option on your left. Then, click on the Verify integrity of game files. If your game’s data is corrupted, this process will re-download all of your files. And if not, you can try the additional fixes to resolve lag and high latency problems.\nAdditional Quick Fixes Make sure that your Windows is updated. While playing Lost Ark, don’t use a proxy or VPN. Because using a VPN or proxy can use a lot of your bandwidth. Clear out all the background processes that might be taking up your internet connection. Switch to a wired connection rather than wireless for seamless connectivity. That’s all on how to fix lag and latency issues in Lost Ark.
