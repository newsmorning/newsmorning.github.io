Is Your HP Pavilion Tx2500 Charging Cable Suddenly Switching Off Mid-Use? Find Out Why Now!

Is your HP Pavilion Tx2500 charging cable suddenly switching off mid-use? This can be a frustrating and confusing issue, especially if you rely on your laptop for work or personal use. Fortunately, there are a few common reasons why this may be happening, and some easy solutions to fix the problem.

One reason your HP Pavilion Tx2500 charging cable may be suddenly switching off mid-use is due to a faulty power adapter. The power adapter is the small box that plugs into the wall and connects to the charging cable. Over time, these devices can wear out, become damaged, or have a loose connection. If you notice that your power adapter is hot to the touch or making strange sounds, it may be time to replace it.

Another reason why your charging cable may be switching off mid-use is due to a damaged cable. Charging cables can become frayed or damaged over time, which can cause them to disconnect from your laptop unexpectedly. Look for any visible signs of damage, such as cuts or tears in the cable. If you notice any damage, it's time to replace the charging cable.

Poor ventilation can also cause your HP Pavilion Tx2500 charging cable to switch off mid-use. If you're using your laptop on a soft surface or in a confined space, such as on your bed or in your lap, it can prevent air from flowing beneath the device, which can cause it to overheat. Overheating can cause your charging cable to suddenly switch off mid-use in order to protect your device from damaging.

Finally, malware or viruses can interfere with the charging process and cause your cable to switch off unexpectedly. Perform a malware scan on your device to ensure that it's free from any malicious software that could be interfering with your charging cable.

In conclusion, if your HP Pavilion Tx2500 charging cable is suddenly switching off mid-use, there are a few reasons why this may be happening. A faulty power adapter, a damaged cable, poor ventilation, or malware can all cause this issue. By checking for visible damage, ensuring proper ventilation, performing a malware scan, or replacing your power adapter, you can fix this problem and continue using your laptop without interruption.

## Chosen Solution
 When connecting the charging cable while Windows is running, the battery does not charge
When the device is turned off, it will charge normally

 Hi @ahmed2030 ,
How long does the tablet operate for when on the battery only, after it has been fully charged?
It may be that the battery is failing and that the charger cannot run both the tablet and charge the battery at the same time.
Create a battery report to check the status of the battery.
When you have the report, compare the Design Capacity value versus the Full Charge Capacity value. With a good battery they should be nearly the same value.
If the battery is faulty, there are 3 batteries available for the model. Search online using the part number only for the battery that you want, to get results for suppliers that suit you best.
