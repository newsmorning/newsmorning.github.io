Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When Our Charger Broke Off In Our Self Balancing Board's Port - Learn How We Got It Out!

Introduction:

Self-balancing boards have become one of the most sought-after gadgets in recent years. These devices are incredibly convenient and provide tons of fun to riders. However, they are not immune to technical difficulties, and users may encounter problems while charging or using them. One problem people face is when the charger breaks off in the board's charging port. This incident happened to us, and we learned how to get it out without causing any further damage. In this post, we will share our experience and give you tips on how to remove the charger without damaging your device.

The Incident:

We were using our self-balancing board for an afternoon ride when we noticed it had a low battery charge. We rushed to the house to plug the charger into the board's charging port, but it broke off in the port. The charger's metal sticking out of the port made it impossible to charge.

Our first instinct was to pull out the charger, but it wouldn't budge, so we stopped before causing any damage. We searched for solutions online and online communities but found none that helped.

The Procedure:

We decided to take a DIY method to get the charger out without causing any further damage. Here is what we did:

Step 1: Get the Necessary Tools

We used a pair of tweezers, a cotton swab, and a toothpick to remove the charger from the port. Tweezers helped grab the metal part of the charger while a toothpick pushed the charger out from behind.

Step 2: Clean the Port

Before putting another charger into the port, we used a cotton swab to clean it. Failing to clean the port may cause other charging difficulties.

Step 3: Check for any damage

We thoroughly inspected the charging port and pins to ensure no damage was done and that it was safe to charge the board. Luckily, there was no damage or bending.

Step 4: Charge the Board

Once we were confident the board had no damage, we plugged in a new charger and allowed it to charge.

Conclusion:

Removing a charger that breaks off inside the self-balancing board's charging port can be an overwhelming task. However, with the right tools, gentle approach, and a bit of patience, the process can be seamless. We hope these tips help you avoid damaging your device and have it charge successfully. Remember to take your time and be careful not to cause any additional damage to your board.

## Chosen Solution
 The charger broke off in the charger port and was wondering how I could get it out?

 When we went to charge it it broke off

 Charger what broke off? The plug? If there was enough force placed to break it off, I'd say the internal receptacle is most likely damaged as well.
One trick I use to get plugs out is to get some Silly Putty. Squish it into the plug, then quickly yank. It might not come completley out, but it should get it out far enough to get some tweesers or needlenose pliers in there.
Other than that, without a pic showing exactly what's going on I can't really give a more detailed answer.
