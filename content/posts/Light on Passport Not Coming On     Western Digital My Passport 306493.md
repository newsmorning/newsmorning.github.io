## Chosen Solution
 If I hold the USB tightly in the slot it will come on but goes off when I let go. The usb cable works on other passorts and I have tried other usb cables with the same response. I believe it has something to do with the plugin spot. Is this fixable?

 Normally it is, happens on phones as well, due to normal wear and tear.
You can try to open it up and reajust the usb port.
However, you might want to backup your vital files from your drive. you can force your USB in with rubber bands, as a temporary fix just so you can back up said files. Then, proceed with the operation.
