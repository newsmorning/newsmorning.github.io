As technology continues to progress, laptops have become an essential tool in our daily lives. From office work to school projects, these devices have made us more productive and efficient. However, the convenience that laptops offer can be quickly taken away if we don’t take care of them properly.\nOne of the most common problems that laptop users face is a total shutdown due to a tiny screw that has been misplaced inside the device. When this happens, it can be a complete nightmare, especially if you have important files that you haven’t saved.\nThankfully, there are ways to prevent this catastrophe from happening. Here are some tips you should know to keep your laptops in good shape:\nKeep your workspace clean and tidy. The first step in preventing a tiny screw from causing your laptop to shut down is keeping your workspace clean and tidy. This means clearing away any debris, food crumbs, or other particles that might find their way inside the device’s internal components.\nBe careful when upgrading or repairing your laptop. If you are upgrading or repairing your laptop, you should handle it with care. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions, and avoid working on it in a cluttered work area. Also, make sure to use the proper tools when disassembling or reassembling your device.\nUse a laptop cooling pad. Using a laptop cooling pad can help keep your device’s internal components cool, preventing overheating and possible failures. Not only that, but it can also provide comfort when typing for long periods.\nRegularly clean your laptop. It is essential to clean your laptop regularly to prevent the accumulation of dirt and dust that can clog up its internal components. Use a soft-bristled brush or a compressed air duster to remove any debris gently.\nAlways be cautious. Finally, always be cautious when handling your laptop. Avoid spilling liquids on it or dropping it, as this can cause significant damage to its internal components.\nIn conclusion, a tiny screw that has been misplaced inside your laptop can cause a catastrophic shutdown that can result in disastrous consequences. However, by following these tips, you can prevent this from ever happening to you. Remember to keep your workspace clean and tidy, be careful when upgrading or repairing your laptop, use a laptop cooling pad, regularly clean your device, and always be cautious. By keeping these things in mind, you can ensure that your laptop will always function the way it’s supposed to.\nChosen Solution So my laptop is Acer Nitro 5 An515-43. I usually remove battery and do the stuff. But yesterday I forgot to takeout the battery. And while removing the screws of fans that I was about to clean.. A screw fell on the smd capacitor and a tiny spark came. the capacitor was near to the bios. I immediately connected the battery and turned on but only keyboard light and fans are working. And display is not working. No output via hdmi too. What could have gone wrong? When I gave to sc he said that gpu is gone. But I don’t think so.. please anyone guide me regarding this? Motherboard model LA-J621P Similar schematics : Here\nHere is the motherboard view.\nhttps://anonfiles.com/Zd68aa0fy6/Nitro_A…\nDenom Parkour I think you really answered this question yourself when you said that “and a tiny spark came.” That screw most likely caused a short circuit. At minimum you will have to replace the component that got shorted out and then re-evaluate your dame. WE would need to know the exact motherboard number (should be printed on the board itself) to see if there are any schematics ertc. available for it. If you can fiosdn a number etc. on the board post some really good picture off the motherboard with your QUESTION. That way we can see what you see. Adding images to an existing question\nSymptoms look like there is something wrong with the GPU, not necessarily the main chip, but also the GPU power line and so on… As mentioned you should find where the shorted(?) capacitor belongs (maybe is from BIOS line), replace it and go from there. Sadly if a lot of power went through to GPU chip (if it is the GPU) then it could be shot….\n","wordCount":"724","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lois Davis"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/a-screw-fell-on-motherboard-and-it-doesn-t-start-pc-laptop-1884930/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Computer Nightmare: One Tiny Screw Causes Total Laptop Shutdown - Learn How to Prevent this Catastrophe!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 17, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;724 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lois Davis</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#keep-your-workspace-clean-and-tidy>Keep your workspace clean and tidy.</a></li><li><a href=#be-careful-when-upgrading-or-repairing-your-laptop>Be careful when upgrading or repairing your laptop.</a></li><li><a href=#use-a-laptop-cooling-pad>Use a laptop cooling pad.</a></li><li><a href=#regularly-clean-your-laptop>Regularly clean your laptop.</a></li><li><a href=#always-be-cautious>Always be cautious.</a></li><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=computer-nightmare-one-tiny-screw-causes-total-laptop-shutdown---learn-how-to-prevent-this-catastrophe>Computer Nightmare: One Tiny Screw Causes Total Laptop Shutdown - Learn How to Prevent this Catastrophe!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#computer-nightmare-one-tiny-screw-causes-total-laptop-shutdown---learn-how-to-prevent-this-catastrophe>#</a></h1><p>As technology continues to progress, laptops have become an essential tool in our daily lives.
