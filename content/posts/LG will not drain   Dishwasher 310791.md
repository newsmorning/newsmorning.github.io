Title: Trouble in the Kitchen: LG Dishwasher REFUSES to Drain! Find Out Why!

Introduction:
A dishwasher is a handy appliance that saves us time and effort, especially for busy homemakers who have to juggle multiple responsibilities. However, like any other device, dishwashers sometimes fail to perform their fundamental task - draining the water. It can be both frustrating and messy if a dishwasher refuses to drain, making you wonder about the root cause of the issue. In this article, we will focus on the reasons why your LG dishwasher may refuse to drain, and what you can do about it.

Body:
1) Blockage in the Drain Hose:
One of the primary reasons why your LG dishwasher isn't draining could be a blockage in the drain hose. Over time, food particles, grease, and other debris can accumulate in the hose, leading to clogs. To solve this issue, the first step is to turn off the power to your dishwasher and remove the drain hose. After that, clear the hose of any obstructions by using a long object such as a wire or a coat hanger. If the blockage is severe, you may need to replace the hose.

2) Clogged Garbage Disposal:
Another reason why your LG dishwasher is not draining could be a clogged garbage disposal. Dishwasher drainage pipes usually share the same connection as the kitchen sink's drain, leading to the garbage disposal. If the disposal gets clogged, it leads to water backing up from the dishwasher. To fix the issue, you should remove any debris from the disposal and ensure that the blades are sharp enough to shred the food effectively.

3) Faulty Drain Pump:
A faulty drain pump can also be the culprit behind the drainage issues in your LG dishwasher. A flawed pump won't be able to pump the water out of the dishwasher, leading to drainage issues. To test if the drain pump is the cause of the problem, remove its cover and look for any signs of damage, such as cracks or leaks. You can also test the pump by running it manually to see if it is working as expected. If the drain pump is faulty, you will need to replace it with a new one.

Conclusion:
A dishwasher that refuses to drain is a frustrating issue that can disrupt your routine. We hope that this article has shed some light on the common causes of drainage issues in LG dishwashers and how to solve them. Remember to maintain your dishwasher regularly by cleaning the filters, regularly removing food particles from the drain, and keeping the garbage disposal clear. With proper care and maintenance, your LG dishwasher will serve you well for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 So Iâ€™ve watched all the videos, at first I got a partial drain with a error code, 0E, so I switched out after finding no obstructions, the drain hose. When I put it back together, I was able to drain manually. Then I ran a cycle and the dishwasher would not drain at all, no error code no draining.  Then, according to other videos and questions, I thought it was a faulty drain pump. So I switched that out. Again when I turned it back on, I was able to drain it manually the very first time. I again ran a cycle, no error, but also no drain. So I seem to somehow make it worse. Has anyone ever had this happen. Same garbage disposal same everything, brand new hose kit, And a brand new drain pump. Any suggestions would be fantastic

 This was the problem on my dishwasher. The check value was worn.
Maybe this video will help.
