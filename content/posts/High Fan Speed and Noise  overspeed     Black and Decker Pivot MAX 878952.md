Is Your Black And Decker Pivot Max on Overspeed? Discover How to Silence Its High Fan Speed and Noise in Seconds!

If you own a Black and Decker Pivot Max, you know how useful it can be for cleaning your home or office. Its powerful suction and intelligent design are designed to make cleaning a breeze, and its cordless operation makes it even more convenient to use. However, some users have reported that their Black and Decker Pivot Max has a high fan speed and noise, which can be annoying and disruptive. If you are experiencing this issue, here are some tips on how to silence its high fan speed and noise in seconds.

Tip #1: Clean the Filter and Dust Bowl

One of the most common reasons for the high fan speed and noise of your Black and Decker Pivot Max is a clogged filter or dust bowl. Over time, dust, debris, and hair can accumulate in the filter or dust bowl, reducing its airflow and causing the motor to work harder than necessary. To solve this problem, you need to clean the filter and dust bowl regularly with a brush or cloth. Make sure the filter and dust bowl are completely dry before reassembling them.

Tip #2: Check for Blockages in the Hose

Another reason for the high fan speed and noise of your Black and Decker Pivot Max is a blockage in the hose. If the hose is clogged, airflow is restricted, and the motor has to work harder to compensate, resulting in the high fan speed and noise. To check for blockages in the hose, detach it from the vacuum, and inspect it for any objects, such as lint, hair, or debris. Use a wand or stick to remove the blockage and reattach the hose.

Tip #3: Replace the Battery

If you have tried cleaning the filter and dust bowl and checking for blockages in the hose, and still finding the high-speed fan and noise, it may be time to replace the battery. The battery is the power source of your Black and Decker Pivot Max, and if it is weak, the motor has to work harder to maintain the desired suction, resulting in the high fan speed and noise. Purchase a new battery that meets the manufacturer's specifications and replace the old one.

In conclusion, the Black and Decker Pivot Max is a useful and convenient cleaning tool that offers powerful suction and cordless operation. However, it may experience high fan speed and noise, which can be resolved by cleaning the filter and dust bowl, checking for blockages in the hose, or replacing the battery. By following these tips, you can silence your Black and Decker Pivot Max's high fan speed and noise in seconds and have it operate smoothly again.

## Chosen Solution
 It worked well for a year or so, then we noticed that it made a very high pitched noise like the fan was overspeeding. Also, the debris that we sucked up was shooting out the rear screen. B&D sent us a new unit, but I’m wondering if this one can’t be fixed? On the new one, when it’s switched on, the fan turns on immediately, the broken one sort of “spools up” instead of starting at max power, but then seems to overspeed. It still sucks up, but shoots everything out the rear cooler screen. The wires seems to be connected properly still.

 There is a big chance what you are hearing has nothing to do with over speed and has everything to do with the motor vibrating violently due to the mounting mechanism breaking. The motor on this unit is fastened to the housing in a cantilever style which means if the unit is dropped or hit hard, the weight of the motor creates a torque that can break the plastic at the mounting screw. This is due to bad design. I bought two of these, opened them both and they both broke at the exact to point; the thin plastic that secures the motor to the housing.
