Title: Unlock the Secret Formula to Decreasing Percentages like a Math Pro with these Step-by-Step Calculations!

Introduction:

Percentages are a critical aspect of modern-day calculations in various fields of study, including economics, business, and science. However, many students and professionals struggle to calculate percentages efficiently, which can lead to errors and complications in their work. The key to decreasing percentages like a math pro lies in understanding the underlying principles and formulas. In this article, we will guide you through step-by-step calculations that will help you unlock the secret formula to decreasing percentages with ease.

Step-by-step calculations:

Step 1: Understand the basic formula for calculating percentages

The basic formula for calculating percentages is as follows:

Percentage = (Part / Whole) x 100

In this formula, the "part" refers to the fraction of the whole that you are interested in finding the percentage for. The "whole" refers to the total value of the sample.

Step 2: Convert the percentage to a decimal

To decrease a percentage, you need to convert it to a decimal. To do this, divide the percentage by 100. For example, if you want to decrease 25%, divide 25 by 100 to get 0.25.

Step 3: Multiply by the original value

To calculate the new value after decreasing a percentage, multiply the original value by the decimal obtained in step 2. For example, if the original value is $50 and you want to decrease it by 25%, multiply $50 by 0.25 to get $12.50. The new value would be $37.50.

Step 4: Round off the final value

The final step is to round off the new value to the desired number of decimal places. You can use the following rules for rounding:

- If the digit to the right of the decimal is 5 or greater, round up
- If the digit to the right of the decimal is less than 5, round down

For example, if the new value is $37.50 and you want to round it off to two decimal places, the final value would be $37.50.

Conclusion:

Decreasing percentages can be challenging for many students and professionals, but by understanding the basic formula and following the step-by-step calculations, you can unlock the secret to decreasing percentages like a math pro. Remember to convert the percentage to a decimal, multiply it by the original value, and round off the final value to the desired number of decimal places. With these calculations in your arsenal, you will be able to tackle percentage problems with confidence and precision.

### Examples
 
#### Example #1
 
If we buy a laptop for $750 and after a year, we want to change the laptop because the technology has evolved, and our need has also changed to the extent that we need the upgraded version with more space and speed, and performance. If you want to sell the laptop after a year, the market value of the laptop will become $400 even though it is only one year old and is kept in excellent condition. We can find the percentage decrease for the laptop with the help of the percentage decrease formula.
 
In the real world, most commodities or items lose their market value after buying them. This situation is applicable in the case of a laptop.
 
The following is given data for calculating the laptop’s decreased percentage.
 
Therefore, the calculation of the percentage decrease is as follows,
 
= ($400 – $750)/$400
 
Percentage Decrease will be –
 
- Decrease Percentage = -47%

 
In this example, for the price of the laptop, we can see that the percentage decrease in the value of the laptop is 47%. The reason for the decrease in prices is an advancement in technology, and also, in general, in the real world, the value of an underlying decreases in market value once one user uses it.
 
#### Example #2
 
Suppose we buy a car for $35,000, and after three years, we want to sell the old car and buy a new car as our needs and requirements have changed. If you sell the car after three years, the vehicle’s market value will become $20,000, even though it is only three years old and is kept in perfect condition. We can find the percentage decrease for the car with the help of the percentage decrease formula.
 
In the real world, most commodities or items lose their market value after buying them. This situation is applicable in the case of a car.
 
The following is given data for calculation of the decreased percentage of the car.
 
= ($20,000 – $35,000)/$20,000
 
- Decrease Percentage = -43%

 
In this example, for the price of the laptop, we can see that the percentage decrease in the value of the laptop is 43%. The reason for the decrease in prices is an advancement in technology, and also, in general, in the real world, the value of an underlying decreases in market value once one user uses it.
 
#### Example #3
 
Let us look at a more practical example to use the concept of percentage decrease. The price of Brent crude in NYMEX was $78 per barrel a year back. It is trading at $ 67 currently. We can find the percentage decrease for Brent crude oil with the help of the percentage decrease formula.
 
Below is given data for calculation of the percentage decrease of Brent crude.
 
= ($67 – $78)/$67
 
- Percentage Decrease = -14%

 
In this example, for the price of the laptop, we can see that the percentage decrease in the value of the laptop is 14%.

### Relevance and Uses
 
The percentage decrease equation helps in determining the percentage by which the value of the underlying has decreased in actuality. It is also used in finance to determine how much the value of the shares has decreased or how much the overall portfolio has decreased.
 
It also helps a great deal in making comparisons. For example, suppose the portfolio has seen a percentage decrease and the index the portfolio is trying to track and emulate has also decreased. In that case, the formula helps in comparing which of the two has fallen more, thus helping in deciding on whether to make any changes to the portfolio.
 
Percentage decrease is a very important mathematical concept to find the difference between the final value and the initial of any underlying. The method to calculate the decrease percentage is to find the difference between the final value of an underlying and the initial value of the same underlying and then divide that difference by the initial value. This will give us a percentage decrease in the value of an underlying. The percentage decrease is an important concept as, in real life, most items lose their value when bought or taken out of the shop or showroom.
 
The percentage decrease is an important concept as, in real life, most items lose their value once bought or used by one user. The percentage decrease equation is also used a lot in the world of finance to determine how much the value of the shares has decreased in percentage or how much the overall portfolio has decreased. The percentage decrease equation is also used to find the percentage decline across commodities to make comparisons.
