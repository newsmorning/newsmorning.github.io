 How to get Samsung tablet to change using usb

 Hi,
Use a magnifying glass and a strong light to visually check the USB charge port to ensure that it is not damaged i.e. all the pins are there and that they are all straight and parallel with each other.
Also ensure that there is no lint or debris in the port enclosure that is preventing a good electrical connection. If there is use a vacuum cleaner to try and suck it out. DO NOT use a pin or metal probe to try and get it out as you may damage the pins If necessary use a sharpened wooden toothpick to gently pry out any stubborn material.
If the port enclosure seems OK  check if the USB port is loose.
Here’s a link to the ifixit Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 Micro USB Port Replacement guide which shows how to access the port so that it can be checked.
