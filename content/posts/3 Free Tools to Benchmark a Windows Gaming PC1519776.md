# Unlock Jaw-dropping Gaming Performance with These 3 Insanely Powerful FREE Windows Benchmarking Tools!

Are you tired of playing games on your computer and experiencing annoying lags and drops in frame rates? Do you want to unlock the full potential of your gaming rig and achieve jaw-dropping performance? If so, you need to benchmark your system and identify the weak spots that are holding you back. Fortunately, there are plenty of free benchmarking tools available for Windows users that can help you achieve that goal. Here are the top three that will give you the best results.

## 1. Unigine Heaven

Unigine Heaven is a popular graphics benchmarking tool that is designed to stress-test your computer's graphics card and measure its performance. It uses a stunningly beautiful 3D engine that showcases the full potential of your GPU and simulates the most demanding scenarios, including dynamic lighting and particles effects. The results are presented in an easy-to-read format that shows your average frame rate, minimum and maximum frame rate, and benchmark score. Moreover, Unigine Heaven allows you to compare your results with other users' results and see how your system ranks in different categories.

## 2. Cinebench R20

Cinebench R20 is a CPU benchmarking tool that tests your computer's processing power and evaluates its ability to handle complex 3D rendering tasks. It uses the latest version of the Cinema 4D engine to generate a series of images and animations that put your CPU under maximum load. The results are presented in a numerical form that shows your single-core and multi-core performance, as well as your performance per watt. Cinebench R20 is an excellent tool to determine how well your computer can handle demanding applications like video editing or 3D modeling.

## 3. CrystalDiskMark

CrystalDiskMark is a storage benchmarking tool that evaluates the performance of your computer's hard drives or solid-state drives (SSD). It uses a simple interface that lets you select the drive you want to test and the test size, and then runs a series of read and write tests to measure the drive's speed and efficiency. The results are presented in a table that shows your sequential and random read and write speeds, as well as your access time and burst rate. CrystalDiskMark is an essential tool for anyone who wants to optimize their storage setup for gaming or other resource-intensive applications.

In conclusion, Windows users have access to a wide variety of free benchmarking tools that can help them unlock the full potential of their gaming rig. By using Unigine Heaven to test your graphics card, Cinebench R20 to test your CPU, and CrystalDiskMark to test your storage, you can identify the weak spots in your system and take the necessary steps to improve your performance. So don't settle for average gaming performance; use these insanely powerful benchmarking tools to achieve jaw-dropping results!

In this article, I’m going to write about three of my favorite benchmark programs and how to use them. I’m not going to go into any details about how to improve your score in this article as that’s a completely different topic, however, it’s something you should definitely research. When I benchmarked my gaming PC, it was ranking in the 43rd percentile, which was pretty pathetic for me.
 
After tweaking some settings in the BIOS related to XMP, overclocking, etc.,  I got it all the way up to the 76th percentile! So tweaking your hardware settings can make a big difference in your benchmark score. The scores shown below are from a non-gaming PC as I didn’t have my gaming desktop available when writing this article.
 

 
## NovaBench
 
Novabench is a small benchmark program that lets you benchmark your PC in just a few minutes. I like it because it’s very easy to use and it gives you simple easy-to-understand results. Once you download it, go ahead and install it.
 
Run the program and then click on Start Tests. They also have a Pro version for $19 that lets you track the temperature over time, etc., but it’s really not needed unless you are a hardcore PC enthusiast.
 
It performs six tests, which can take anywhere from a minute to a few minutes depending on the speed of your system.
 
The results window will give you a Novabench score, which doesn’t mean much on its own unless you are benchmarking your PC several times before and after upgrading the hardware, overclocking, etc. If you click on the View Performance Charts and Comparisons button at the bottom, it will load a web page where you can get your percentile.
 
In addition, you can click on Scores & Stats at the very top, which will show you all scores recorded from highest to lowest. This is a good way to see how far you are from the fastest and best computer that has been benchmarked by the Novabench software.
 
## UserBenchmark
 
Another really good program and website is UserBenchmark. Just download the software and run the EXE file to start the test. What I like about UserBenchmark is that it doesn’t even require any installation.
 
Simply click on Run to start the tests. It will take a few minutes and then the results will be displayed in a new browser window.
 
You’ll see a score for Gaming, Desktop and Workstation performance. If you scroll further down, you’ll also get an overall percentile score and a component-specific percentile score.
 
It’s worth noting that the overall percentile score is only against other computers with the same components. The PC benchmarked above is not in the 72nd percentile out of all computers benchmarked using their software. So the PC above is in the 72nd percentile out of all computers with the same components.
 
## FutureMark 3DMark
 
Finally, the other one you should use if you are really wanting to get a proper demanding test done for a high-end gaming machine is Futuremark’s 3DMark benchmark. The basic edition is free and includes four free benchmarking tests.
 
I only suggest running this one on an actual gaming or high-performance workstation because the download is a whopping 3 GB! Mostly it’s just large files for playing back high-resolution graphics for testing, but it eats up a lot of space. Of course, you can run the benchmark and then uninstall it to get the space back.
 
After installing 3DMark and running it, you will see that it loads the Time Spy benchmark first. Just click Run to start the benchmark. This benchmarks takes the longest because it is the most demanding test out of the three.
 
When it’s finished, you’ll get a score, which doesn’t tell much until you compare it with other results. Click on the Compare Result Online button to see what your percentile score is.
 
As you can see, this old computer is only better than 4% of all results! My gaming PC was better than 91% of all results. That’s about it. Hopefully, these benchmarks will give you a good idea of how well your PC is performing overall and compared to others with the same components. Enjoy!
