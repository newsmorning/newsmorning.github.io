Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Iron My Clothes - 110V Plug Fail!

Introduction
Ironing is something most people dread despite the need to have an ironed cloth. Ironing can really change the whole outlook of the cloth and give you confidence while wearing it. However, it can be a nightmare when you are faced with unforeseen events just like I did.

The Incident
It was just another Monday morning, and I was running late for work. I grabbed my clothes and went to the ironing board. In my haste, I failed to notice one vital thing: the voltage. So, I connected my iron to a 110V plug without checking, which was a mistake.

As I pressed the switch on the iron, it failed to heat up, and I had no clue why it wasn't working. I began to panic and wonder how I could iron my clothes to make it to work on time. I tried everything I could think of and even unplugged the iron and plugged it in several times, but it still wouldn't heat up.

What I Did Next
After trying every possible solution that came to mind, I sat down and pondered for a moment. Suddenly, I remembered that I needed a voltage converter to make my 220V iron work with a 110V outlet.

After a mad rush to the store, I finally got a converter and plugged in the iron. This time around, it worked perfectly, and I was able to iron my clothes in no time! I felt such a sense of relief and gratefulness that I didn't miss work that day.

What I Learned
The experience taught me a valuable lesson: always double-check the voltage requirement of your electronics before plugging them in. Not confirming the voltage can lead to dire consequences, and it is a mistake I wouldn't want to make again.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the experience I had when trying to iron my clothes was a memorable one that taught me a valuable lesson. Always make sure you check the requirements of any electronic device to ensure it is compatible with the plug. Don't wait until you're running late for work to discover the importance of double-checking the voltage requirement.

## Chosen Solution
 I installed a 110v outlet using one live wire and a grounded wire. I measured the outlet to be 125v. When I plugged a 110 v iron, it did not heat. The iron is working in other 110v outlet., but not in this extension outlet. What is the problem.

 @rogergusilatar Look at how the functional outlet is wired. Copy that or use an electrician. Your house wiring depending on it's age might have only two wires but in anything modern that ground is there to be exactly that: a ground, sounds like you may have miswired the outlet. this page explains how to wire the outlet properly. Black to brass, white to chrome/silver, green to ground.
