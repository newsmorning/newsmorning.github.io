# Skyrocketing Debt To GDP Ratio: Is The Economy Doomed?

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on economies around the world, governments have resorted to massive fiscal measures to mitigate the devastating effects of the crisis. From stimulus checks and unemployment benefits to corporate bailouts and infrastructure spending, countries have opened up the floodgates of public debt to sustain their citizens and businesses in the face of unprecedented uncertainty.

While such measures may be necessary for immediate relief, they also come with a long-term cost that cannot be ignored. One of the most pressing concerns is the increasingly high debt-to-GDP ratio, which signals a potentially unsustainable financial situation for many countries. In this article, we will explore the definition, formula, and real-world examples of this economic indicator and evaluate its implications for the future.

## What Is Debt-To-GDP Ratio?

The debt-to-GDP ratio is a measure of a country's debt burden relative to its economic output. It represents the percentage of the nation's total debt compared to the size of its gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all goods and services produced within its borders in a given period. Essentially, it shows how much debt a country has in relation to its ability to generate income and the overall health of its economy.

A high debt-to-GDP ratio indicates that a country owes more than it produces and may be at risk of defaulting on its payments or facing a financial crisis. On the other hand, a low ratio suggests that a country has more resources and flexibility to manage its debt and invest in its future.

## How To Calculate Debt-To-GDP Ratio

The formula for calculating debt-to-GDP ratio is straightforward. You simply divide a country's total debt by its GDP and multiply the result by 100 to get a percentage. Here's the formula:

**Debt-to-GDP Ratio = (Total Debt / GDP) x 100**

For example, if a country has a total debt of $10 trillion and a GDP of $20 trillion, its debt-to-GDP ratio would be:

**Debt-to-GDP Ratio = ($10 trillion / $20 trillion) x 100 = 50%**

This means that 50% of the country's GDP is taken up by its debt obligations.

## Real-World Examples Of Debt-To-GDP Ratio

To put things into perspective, let's look at some real-world examples of high and low debt-to-GDP ratios. According to the World Bank, the global debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 230% in 2019, up from 150% in 2000. This means that the total debt of all countries combined is more than twice the size of the global economy.

Some countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios include Japan, Greece, Italy, and the United States. Japan, for instance, has a ratio of over 240%, which is the highest in the world. This is mainly due to its aging population, low birth rates, and persistent deflation, which have hampered its economic growth and raised its debt levels. Greece and Italy, both of which have suffered from political instability and austerity measures, also have ratios well above 150%.

On the other hand, some countries with low debt-to-GDP ratios include Norway, Sweden, Chile, and Saudi Arabia. Norway, for instance, has a ratio of only 35%, thanks to its abundant natural resources, strong welfare programs, and prudent fiscal policies. Sweden and Chile, which have implemented structural reforms and diversified their economies, also enjoy relatively low ratios.

## Is The Economy Doomed?

So, is a skyrocketing debt-to-GDP ratio a sign of impending doom for an economy? The answer is not a simple yes or no. While a high ratio can indeed put a strain on a country's finances, it does not necessarily mean that a country is automatically doomed to fail. There are many factors that affect the health and stability of an economy, including demographics, productivity, innovation, and governance.

Moreover, there are various ways to address a high debt-to-GDP ratio, such as increasing revenues, cutting expenses, restructuring debts, and boosting economic growth. These measures require careful planning, coordination, and execution, but they are not impossible or unachievable.

Therefore, instead of panicking or despairing about the debt-to-GDP ratio, we should focus on finding practical and sustainable solutions to strengthen our economies and improve the lives of our citizens. We should also remember that debt is not inherently evil or immoral; it can be a necessary and useful tool for investments in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and other public goods that benefit society as a whole.

In conclusion, the debt-to-GDP ratio is a crucial economic indicator that deserves our attention and scrutiny. We should strive to maintain a healthy and manageable ratio that reflects our economic potential and priorities for the future. Let us not be paralyzed by fear or paralysis, but instead, let us work together to build a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable economy for all.

### The Formula for Debt to GDP Ratio
 
Given below is the formula to calculate the debt to GDP ratio: –

A country with a high ratio will boost its economy and growth and need heavy finances. But, due to a high percentage, it is often unable to raise money from domestic and international markets. Therefore, the countries try to lower their ratio, but it is not an overnight change, and a few years pass by to reduce the rate. The unrest in this ratio is often seen during an economic recession Economic RecessionEconomic recession is defined as the phase in which economic activities of a country become stagnant, leading to a disturbance in the business cycle and affecting the overall demand-supply balance. read more, wartime, or other lending practices of the nation. It is expressed as a percentage. But can do further dimensional analysis to calculate how one can repay the number of years’ debt.
 
According to the IMF, in 2019, Japan’s debt to GDP ratio was 234.18%, the highest, followed by Greece at 181.78% and Sudan at 176.02%. The United States was at 109.45%, France at 96.2%, the United Kingdom at 85.92%, India at 67.29%, and China at 54.44%.
 
As per the records from IMF, below is the graph that shows the debt to GDP Ratio for a few countries for 2018 and 2019.

For example, with a high debt-to-GDP percentage, the government may often push more money into the economy by printing new currency notes, issuing foreign currency instruments, providing low-interest rates to banks and insurance sectors, and bringing new opportunities for its public.

A study conducted by the World Bank found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for a long period, it slows economic growth by 1.7% for every percentage point of debt above this level. Moreover, the growth rate will decline by 2% for each additional percentage of debt above 64% for growing economies.
 
### Debt to GDP Ratio Examples
 
Below are some simple examples to understand this concept in a better manner.
 
#### Example #1
 
We want to calculate the debt to GDP ratio for five countries (hypothetically). For this, we would need their total debt and total GDP.
 
Calculation of Debt to GDP Ratio of Country A
 
- =50/75=66.67%

 
Similarly, we can calculate for the remaining countries.
 
As we can see, country B has the highest GDP, which means it may have difficulty repaying its debts. It is often assumed that countries with a ratio above 100% have chances of defaulting, which is not true. In the above example, we can understand that country Z can repay 78.26% of the total debt.

### Disadvantages
 
- The ratio, to an extent, gives a brief idea about the performance of an economy. However, due to the vastness of data, it is not possible to get very accurate details regarding debt and the GDP of an economy.

### Conclusion
 
The government needs to focus on its GDP and debt to GDP ratio.

Having a higher percentage places them poorly in the international market, and they start losing their scope in the global market. Such economies start providing goods and services at a lower cost, making it even more difficult to cope with their debt (for example, Greece).
 
However, such is not always true for countries like the USA, Japan, Germany, etc. They are strong economies and show growth year on year.
