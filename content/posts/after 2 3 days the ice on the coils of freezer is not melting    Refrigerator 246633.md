Experts Reveal Shocking Reason Why Your Freezer Ice Won't Melt After Just 2-3 Days!

Have you ever been in a situation where you left your ice in the freezer for just a few days, but when you come back to it, it still hasn't melted? If you have, then you are not alone. Many people have experienced this phenomenon, but they have never understood the reason behind it. However, the experts have finally shed some light on this issue.

According to experts, the reason why your freezer ice won't melt after just 2-3 days is that there are freezer burn and dehydration. Freezer burn is the process by which food loses moisture due to exposure to the air. Dehydration occurs when the air gets too dry, causing moisture in the food to evaporate. These two processes can quickly affect your ice, resulting in it not melting.

Freezer burn causes the surface of ice to become dry and discolored. It happens when the food is not wrapped tightly, leaving some air to circulate around it. The process of freezer burn can make the ice harder and take longer to melt. Therefore, to avoid freezer burn, you should wrap your ice tightly with airtight containers or use plastic bags with zipper tops.

On the other hand, dehydration occurs when the humidity in the freezer is too low, causing the moisture in the ice to evaporate. When this happens, the ice can become dry and brittle, making it more challenging to melt. To combat dehydration, it is recommended that you keep the humidity in the freezer at an optimal level, one close to about 70%.

Additionally, some freezers have a defrost cycle that helps prevent freezer burn and dehydration. The defrost cycle works by warming up the freezer and melting any ice that has accumulated. Therefore, it is essential to make sure that your freezer is operating correctly and that the defrost cycle is functioning.

In conclusion, freezer burn and dehydration are the reasons why your freezer ice won't melt after just 2-3 days. The good news is that these issues are preventable by using airtight containers, keeping the humidity in the freezer at an optimal level, and ensuring that your freezer's defrost cycle is working. With these tips, your ice should melt quickly, and you won't have to worry about your drinks being watered down.

 My referigerator model is RT26GCPN1 samsung .the fan is working but after 2-3 days the ice on the coils of freezer is not melting. What could be the reason ?

 Hi,
I can’t find any information online about parts for your refrigerator but check if the defrost heater is OK.
The defrost heater is usually very close to the evaporator unit which is inside the freezer compartment behind a panel. It is powered on every defrost cycle to help melt the ice buildup on the evaporator unit so the water can drain away to the evaporator pan which is located outside the compartments under the refrigerator.
Disconnect the power from the fridge and then disconnect the wire harness connector to the defrost heater and use an Ohmmeter to measure its’ resistance. Usually most defrost heaters test somewhere between 20-50 Ohms.
Here’s a link just to show you what the heater might look like. As I said, I couldn’t find any parts information about your model but hopefully the images in the link will help you to find it so that it can be tested.
If the defrost heater is OK, does the refrigerator go into the auto defrost cycle once every 6-11 hours?
Not sure how often it occurs with  your model, but the compressor is stopped for about 20 minutes to allow the ice to be melted and then restarted again to cool the fridge back down again. During the defrost cycle the freezer temperature will go up to 0 deg C (32F) to help melt the ice. This is normal.
