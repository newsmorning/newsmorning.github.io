While the US and UK financial systems are still mainly utilizing the horizontal format for their Income Statements, they are slowly becoming more open to adopting the vertical format. This is due to the advantages of the vertical format, making it more favorable for certain industries and companies.

The Indian financial system has been using the vertical format for a long time, and as a result, Indian companies have become highly skilled in interpreting this format. With the global adoption of the vertical format, Indian businesses will have a significant advantage over other countries since they have experience with the format.

In conclusion, the universal Income Statement format taking the world by storm is the vertical format. While the US and UK systems still mainly use the horizontal format, the vertical format is gaining international recognition and adoption. So, if your business is deciding which Income Statement format to use, consider the advantages of the vertical format, and give it a try. Who knows, it may just take your business to the next level.
