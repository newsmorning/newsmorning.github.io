Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Cleaned My iPhone 7 Plus Charging Port With Isopropyl – My Home Button Stopped Working!

Introduction:

iPhones are known for their excellent performance and quality, but one of the most common issues faced by iPhone users is the charging port getting clogged with dust and dirt. This can hinder the charging process and cause other problems. To tackle this issue, many iPhone users use isopropyl alcohol to clean their charging ports. But, did you know that cleaning your iPhone’s charging port with isopropyl can cause your home button to stop working? In this article, we will discuss why this happens and how to avoid it.

Body:

What is Isopropyl Alcohol?
Isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol, is a common solvent used for cleaning electronic devices. It is a highly effective cleaning agent that evaporates quickly, leaving no residue behind. It is widely used to clean delicate electronic components, including charging ports.

Why Does Isopropyl Alcohol Affect Home Button Functionality?
The home button in an iPhone relies on electrical connections to function properly. When isopropyl alcohol is used to clean the charging port, it can seep in through the small opening and corrode the electrical contacts inside the home button. This can cause the button to malfunction and stop working altogether.

How to Avoid Home Button Malfunction When Cleaning Charging Ports
To avoid your home button from malfunctioning when cleaning your iPhone’s charging port, there are a few things you can do:

1. Use a Q-tip or soft-bristled brush to clean the charging port instead of isopropyl alcohol. A simple brush can be an effective way to remove dirt and dust.

2. Use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol, and apply it only to the charging port. Avoid pouring it directly into the port as it can seep into other parts of the phone.

3. Dry the charging port with a microfiber cloth after cleaning to prevent any moisture from remaining inside the port.

Conclusion:

Cleaning your iPhone’s charging port is essential for maintaining your device’s performance, but it is vital to avoid using isopropyl alcohol to avoid home button malfunctioning. By following the tips mentioned above, you can clean your charging port without worrying about damaging the phone’s functionality. Now you know why using isopropyl alcohol to clean the charging port can cause home button malfunctioning, and how to clean it effectively without causing any harm to your device.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi all fixers!
I got problem with home button in my iPhone 7 plus. Just few minutes ago i clean my charging port with Isopropyl Alcohol 99,9% but few drops of it drop on home button. Now the home button doesnt “click” but touchID working perfectly fine. What can i do now? It is dead and need to change the home button?
Or maybe i need to open the iphone and clean it inside?

 Firstly try opening the phone and making sure everything inside is fine. Clean all of the connectors with the iso and then make sure it’s all firmly plugged in before trying to power on again. If you’re still having no luck with it, then you may need to get a third-party replacement button, but be aware any replacement home button will only function for the click, and TouchID will no longer work. 

An alternative could be to use the assistive touch feature instead of physically clicking the home button. Personally I would rather be able to unlock the phone with the TouchID, even if the actual click of the button didn’t work, but up to your preference.

 After a few moments when the alcohol evaporated, it started to work .
