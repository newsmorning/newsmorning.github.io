Are You Losing Half of Your Smartphone's Functionality After a Shock? Discover How Sony Xperia M2 Survives Impact!

We all know how much we rely on our smartphones. From checking emails to making important phone calls, these devices have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, accidents happen, and sometimes our phones end up taking a hard impact. This typically leads to dreaded cracked screens, but the real danger is hidden inside the device. In most cases, drops or hard impacts can cause a smartphone's internal components to get damaged, leading to the loss of functionality. But, what if there was a smartphone that could survive impacts while still maintaining full functionality? Enter the Sony Xperia M2.

The Sony Xperia M2 is a mid-range smartphone that boasts impressive durability, thanks to its innovative design. Not only does the device look sleek and stylish, but it is also built to withstand drops and hard impacts. The phone's outer shell is made of tough polycarbonate material, which is both lightweight and durable. But the real secret to the Xperia M2's toughness lies in its internal construction.

Unlike most smartphones, the Xperia M2 has a unique design that separates the motherboard from the screen and the battery. This is a crucial feature that allows the phone to absorb impacts without damaging the internal components. In other words, when the phone is dropped or experiences a hard impact, the screen will crack, but the motherboard and battery will remain intact.

This means that you can drop your Xperia M2 and still make phone calls, check emails, and use all of your phone's apps without any loss of functionality. Of course, the screen will need to be replaced, but the phone will still be fully operational. This is a game-changer for anyone who relies heavily on their smartphone and can't afford to lose functionality due to an accidental drop.

But durability isn't the only thing that sets the Xperia M2 apart from other smartphones. The device also boasts impressive specifications, including a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor, 8GB of internal storage, and a 4.8-inch display. The camera is also impressive, with an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and video calls.

Overall, if you're in the market for a durable smartphone that can withstand the occasional accidental drop, the Sony Xperia M2 is definitely worth considering. With its unique design and impressive specifications, this device is a game-changer that sets itself apart from other mid-range smartphones on the market. So, if you're tired of losing functionality after a shock, give the Xperia M2 a try and see for yourself why this device is gaining so much popularity among users who need a tough smartphone that can keep up with their active lifestyles.

## Chosen Solution
 After a shock , loud speaker and viberation motors are half working
After a sock the the vibration motor stopped, and it works for a small time after clicking with my fingers on the mobile and then it stops until i click again.
and the loud speaker is working but it's volume is too much low, i think one of the channels ( right or left) have just stopped working.
can it be repaired without replacing the motor/speaker ? (for example , the sock made the connectors of the motor disconnect , so reconnect them again... )

 If it is the two pieces, loud speaker and the vibration motor that are broken then those can be replaced.
For the loudspeaker look at this guide.

In the same guide at the end it is also shown in green where the vibromotor is.
I have bought spare parts for Sony smartphones over ebay, but also locally where I live in Stockholm, Sweden.
UPDATE
It could be that the cable have come out of the connector. You would still have to open the phone which is the most difficult part since it is glued and you will have to use some heat to make it easier.
I would open the phone, disconnect the cables, reconnect them and then start the phone to see if it is working. If it is working you will need the a cover adhesive like this one to glue the phone together again.
If it is not working you would have to get the spare parts before gluing the phone together again.
