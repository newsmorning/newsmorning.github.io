# Stop Windows 10 from Crashing! Here's How to Fix the Dreaded Kernel Security Check Error!

If you're a Windows 10 user, there's a good chance you've encountered the dreaded Kernel Security Check Error at least once. This error can cause your system to crash, which can lead to lost work and frustration. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to fix the problem and prevent it from happening again.

## What is the Kernel Security Check Error?

When Windows encounters an issue with its hardware or software, it triggers a system crash to prevent damage to your files and data. The Kernel Security Check Error is one of the most common reasons for these crashes. It's caused by a system file, the kernel, encountering a problem it can't fix on its own.

The error can be caused by a number of things, including faulty hardware, outdated or incompatible drivers, corrupted system files, and even malware.

## How to Fix the Kernel Security Check Error

Fixing the Kernel Security Check Error can be a bit tricky, as there's no one-size-fits-all solution. However, here are a few things you can try:

### Update Your Drivers

Outdated or incompatible drivers can cause a variety of issues, including the Kernel Security Check Error. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all your hardware components, including your graphics card, network adapter, and sound card.

To update your drivers, go to the manufacturer's website for each component and download the latest driver. Alternatively, you can use a driver updater tool, such as Driver Booster, to automate the process.

### Run a System File Checker Scan

Corrupted system files can cause the Kernel Security Check Error. Fortunately, Windows has a built-in tool called the System File Checker that can scan your system for these files and repair them if necessary.

To run a System File Checker scan, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Start menu and type "cmd" in the search bar.
2. Right-click on Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator."
3. Type "sfc /scannow" and hit Enter.
4. Let the scan run (it may take some time).
5. Restart your computer.

### Check for Malware

Malware can also cause the Kernel Security Check Error. Make sure you have antivirus software installed and up-to-date, and run a full system scan to check for any malware infections.

If you don't have antivirus software, we recommend using Windows Defender. It's built into Windows 10 and provides basic protection against viruses and other malware.

### Check Your Hardware

Faulty hardware, such as a failing hard drive or RAM, can cause the Kernel Security Check Error. If you suspect this is the issue, you may need to replace the faulty component.

To check your hardware, you can use Windows' built-in tools. For example, you can run a memory diagnostic by following these steps:

1. Click on the Start menu and type "mdsched" in the search bar.
2. Select "Windows Memory Diagnostic" and click "Restart now and check for problems."
3. Your computer will restart and run the memory diagnostic.
4. Once the diagnostic is complete, your computer will restart again.

## Conclusion

The Kernel Security Check Error can be frustrating, but it's not impossible to fix. By following the steps outlined above, you can help prevent future crashes and keep your Windows 10 system running smoothly. If you're still encountering issues, you may need to seek help from a professional or consider reinstalling Windows.
