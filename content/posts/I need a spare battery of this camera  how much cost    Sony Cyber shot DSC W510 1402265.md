 Hi,
Just search online for Sony NP-BN1 battery and take your pick.

 As the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W510 is now 7 years old, personally, I would opt for an aftermarket battery on Ebay that can be found for $10.- $15.
An original Sony battery will most  likely cost more than the current  dollar value of the camera.
