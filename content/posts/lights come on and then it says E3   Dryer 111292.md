# Unbelievable! Dryer Starts By Itself and Displays Mysterious E3 Code - You Won't Believe What Happened Next!

It was just another ordinary day, and I was doing my laundry as usual. I loaded the clothes into my dryer, pressed the start button, and went about my day. However, what happened next was something I never imagined in my wildest dreams.

As I was walking past the laundry room, I noticed that the dryer was running even though I did not start it. To my surprise, the display showed a mysterious E3 code. I had never seen anything like this before, and I was puzzled as to what could have triggered the dryer to start on its own.

I immediately turned off the dryer and tried to figure out what the E3 code meant. Upon conducting a quick search online, I found out that it indicated a temperature sensor malfunction. It implied that the dryer was running at an extremely high temperature that could potentially cause a fire hazard.

I was worried about the safety of my home and family, as well as the dryer itself. I knew I had to take immediate action, so I contacted the manufacturer's customer service hotline. The representative on the line was courteous and quickly understood my concern. He advised me that the dryer needed to be inspected by a qualified technician to diagnose the root cause of the issue.

I scheduled a technician's visit for the next day, and he arrived promptly as scheduled. The technician conducted a thorough inspection, and within a few minutes, he located the issue – a faulty heating element. The technician explained that the heating element was causing the dryer to generate excess heat, which in turn activated the E3 code as a warning sign.

The technician quickly replaced the faulty heating element, and the dryer was back to normal. I could not thank the technician and the manufacturer enough for ensuring my family's safety and avoiding a potential catastrophe.

In conclusion, it was an extraordinary and scary experience for me. My dryer starting by itself and displaying E3 code could have ended up being a bigger problem if I had ignored it. I urge everyone to take such warning signs seriously and take prompt action to resolve the issue to avoid any unfortunate incidents.

## Chosen Solution
 When we turn the dryer on the lights come on and then it says E3 .  Any suggestions?? Thank you!!

 f the E3 error code displays on your dryer, this means the dryer has sensed an overload. This error occurs when the dryer has an overload of clothing. ... The E3 error may also show if the dryerair vent hose is blocked or there is a problem with the thermistor.
