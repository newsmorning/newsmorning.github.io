Title: You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Upgrade Your Shave Game: Philips Norelco S5660 Razor Blade Swap Revealed!

If you're tired of the discomfort and hassle of shaving with old, worn out blades, it's time for an upgrade. The Philips Norelco S5660 is a top-tier electric razor that can dramatically improve your shaving experience. But did you know that you can easily swap out its blades to keep the performance at its best? In this article, we'll dive into the benefits of investing in the S5660 and show you how simple it is to change its blades. 

Why Choose the Philips Norelco S5660?

Before we get into the blade swap, let's summarize what makes the Philips Norelco S5660 a great choice for your shaving routine. With advanced technology that adapts to your facial hair density, the S5660 ensures a smooth and even shave every time. Its 72 self-sharpening blades cut hair at every angle, resulting in less irritation and ingrown hairs. Its five-direction flex heads follow the contours of your face, allowing you to reach every hair for a close shave. Plus, the S5660's Wet & Dry feature allows you to use it in the shower with ease. All of these features make for a highly versatile, high-performing electric razor that is perfect for daily use. 

The Benefits of Swapping Blades

While the Philips Norelco S5660 is designed to last for years, its blades will naturally wear down over time. This is where swapping blades comes in. By regularly replacing the blades, you can ensure that the S5660 continues to provide the same high-quality shave that it did when it was brand new. Swapping blades also helps to prevent irritation and ingrown hairs, which can be caused by old or dull blades. 

How to Swap the Blades

Now that you know the benefits of swapping blades, let's explore how to do it. First, turn the razor off and unplug it. Then, hold the top of the shaving head and press the release button on the back. This will allow the top of the shaver to slide out of the base. You can then remove the old blades and snap in the new ones. It's important to note that the Philips Norelco S5660 uses a unique click-on system for its blades. This means that you don't need to worry about aligning the blades or screws. Simply snap them on, and you're done! Reattach the top of the shaving head to the base of the shaver, and you're ready to go. 

Final Thoughts

Investing in the Philips Norelco S5660 is a wise choice if you're looking to upgrade your shaving game. With its advanced technology, Wet & Dry feature, and self-sharpening blades, it's a top-performing electric razor that can provide a close shave with minimal irritation. And with the ability to easily swap out its blades, you can ensure that it continues to perform at its best for years to come. So what are you waiting for?
