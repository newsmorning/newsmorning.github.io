Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Accidentally Detached my MacBook Air's iSight Cable!

Introduction

When we talk about technology and machines, accidents are bound to happen. I am a proud owner of a MacBook Air, and I love it more than anything. Recently, I had an accident with my MacBook's iSight cable that separated from my computer, and what happened next left me astonished. In this article, I will explain in detail how a minor mistake changed my view of technology.

Body

It all started last week when I was upgrading my MacBook Air's RAM. While working on the RAM, I accidentally disconnected the iSight cable, which connects the camera to the computer's logic board. I didn't think it would be an issue, as the camera is not of much use to me. However, when I tried to restart my MacBook, the computer didn't boot up. I panicked, as I thought I had done some serious damage. I researched the issue online and discovered that the iSight cable is essential for the MacBook's functioning.

I ordered a new iSight cable, but it would take a few days for it to arrive. In the meantime, I decided to use my iPhone's camera as a substitute. To my surprise, I noticed that the MacBook's battery life had increased significantly. I always assumed that my MacBook's battery life was average, but it turns out that the camera was consuming more power than I realized. 

With the new iSight cable, I installed it in my MacBook, and I couldn't believe the difference. Not only was my camera working again, but my MacBook's performance had also improved. The computer was faster, ran cooler and the battery life had increased by an hour. I never thought that something as simple as a camera being disconnected would have such a substantial impact.

Conclusion

I learned a valuable lesson from the accident, which is that sometimes even minor things can have a big impact. It's essential to stay informed about our devices and understand their workings. You never know what might affect your machine's performance, even something as simple as a camera. I now have a newfound appreciation for my MacBook air, and I'm grateful to know that even a minor issue can lead to a positive outcome.

## Chosen Solution
 I was putting everything back together after tightening the hinges of my laptop where when I was trying to plug in the iSight cable, it actually detached the port from the mother board, could I still attach it? Or am I screwed?

 I can't be 100% sure from the pictures, but it appears that five of the six circuit board traces the connector is soldered to got ripped off the board along with the connector. As such, the repair becomes significantly more difficult. It is repairable, but is going to take someone with some serious soldering skills to fix it. The pads will have to be restored and the part resoldered onto the replacement pads.
I'm not enough of a board repair expert to be able to tell you how to do that, I'm afraid. I would think you'll have to scrape the conformal coating off the ends of the traces that were broken, then connect them to some sort of replacement. Hopefully some of our repair technicians can offer you ideas on fixing those if you're looking to do it yourself.
Otherwise, a good board repair company should be able to fix you up.
