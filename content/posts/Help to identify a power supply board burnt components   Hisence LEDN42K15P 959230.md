# Is your Hisence LED TV giving you power troubles? Learn how to spot burnt components on the supply board with our expert guide!


Have you recently noticed that your Hisence LED TV is giving you power troubles? Do you feel like your TV is not functioning as it should be? Well, the issue may be related to burnt components on the supply board. 

The supply board is a primary electrical component in your Hisence LED TV that regulates the flow of electrical power to its various parts, including the screen and sound system. Any damage to the supply board can, therefore, have a significant impact on the performance of your TV. 

If you're facing power issues with your Hisence LED TV, you need to know how to spot burnt components on the supply board. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you understand the process.


## Step One: Check the Power Supply

Before you start opening your Hisence LED TV to inspect the supply board, check whether the power supply is functioning correctly. Power fluctuations, sags or surges, can cause components to blow. Use a power meter to check the voltage at the outlet you’re using. 

## Step Two: Unplug Your TV

Before you start inspecting the supply board, unplug your Hisence LED TV from the electrical outlet. This step is crucial to prevent electrical shocks and to ensure your safety. Also, be gentle while handling the TV components as too much force can cause irreparable damage.

## Step Three: Open Your TV

Once you have unplugged your Hisence LED TV, remove its back cover with the help of a screwdriver. Be careful while handling TV screens as you can electrocute yourself if you come in contact with the high voltage components. 

## Step Four: Identify the Supply Board

The supply board is typically located near the power cord entrance, and you can quickly identify it. It is a rectangular board with various components on it, including capacitors and transformers.

## Step Five: Inspect the Supply Board

Now that you have located the supply board, look out for any visible burnt components such as bulging or leaking capacitors. If you have trouble identifying burnt components visually, use a multimeter to check their resistance. If the resistance is zero, then the component is burnt or damaged.

## Step Six: Replace the Burnt Components

Once you have identified the burnt components, the next step is to replace them. You can purchase replacement components from electronics parts suppliers or online retailers. Make sure you buy components that are compatible with your Hisence LED TV model.

## Step Seven: Reassemble Your TV

After replacing the burnt components on the supply board, it's time to reassemble your Hisence LED TV. Make sure you put all TV components back in their correct position and secure the back cover with the screwdriver. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, power troubles in your Hisence LED TV can be frustrating, but with our expert guide, you can easily spot burnt components on the supply board. Don't forget to take safety precautions and exercise caution while handling TV components. If you are unsure about handling electrical components or are not confident, seek professional help.

## Chosen Solution
 While watching TV, a sparkle with an explosion sound came from the TV.
I've opened the TV case and found two burnt parts on the power supply board, as shown in the images below.



Would like your help to identify what parts are day. Next to each of them is written on the board R849, R825 and C811.
Furthermore - if you've got any instructions on how to replace them, I'll be more than happy!
Thanks!

 R849 and R825 are resistors, and C811 is a capacitor.  You can replace them by unsoldering them and soldering in replacements available online or from  an electronic store, but you might want to consider why they burned up in the first place.  The most likely thing is probably V810, the voltage regulator next to them on the board.  It may have failed and caused the resistors and capacitors to fry.  I’d look at the underside of the board and see if you can see any other scorch marks that might point you toward the cause of the problem.
