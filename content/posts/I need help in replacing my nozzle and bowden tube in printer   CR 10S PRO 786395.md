Title: DIY Printer Hack: Watch How I Fixed My CR 10S Pro With This Simple Nozzle and Bowden Tube Replacement Tutorial!

Do you own a 3D printer but find yourself sometimes struggling to get the most out of it? Maybe you're a DIY enthusiast looking for some new projects to take on. Either way, learning how to hack your printer is a great way to ensure that it's always running at its best, and today we'll walk you through one of the most common hacks: replacing the nozzle and Bowden tube in your CR 10S Pro.

Why Replace Your Nozzle and Bowden Tube?

Nozzles are the small metal tips that extrude hot filament, which is then deposited onto the printer bed to create the desired object. They're a critical part of the printer, and as such, they can become clogged with residue or damaged over time.

The Bowden tube is a small, clear plastic hose that guides the filament from the spool down to the nozzle. If this tube becomes damaged or clogged, it can cause issues with the printer's overall performance and even lead to failed prints.

By replacing both the nozzle and the Bowden tube, you're ensuring that your printer is working with clean and undamaged components. This will lead to more precise and accurate printing, fewer failed prints, and an all-around better experience with your printer.

How to Replace Your Nozzle and Bowden Tube

Now that you know why it's a good idea to replace these two components, let's walk through the process of doing so. Before you start, make sure that you have the following tools and materials:

- Replacement nozzle
- Replacement Bowden tube
- Heat-resistant gloves
- Hex wrenches
- Phillips head screwdriver
- Pliers

Step 1: Preheat Your Printer

To replace the nozzle and Bowden tube, you'll need to start by preheating your printer to the appropriate temperature. Consult your printer's manual or do a quick Google search to find out what temperature you need to set it to.

Step 2: Remove the Old Nozzle

Once your printer is preheated, turn off the power and use a hex wrench to remove the old nozzle. Be sure to wear heat-resistant gloves to protect your hands from the hot metal.

Step 3: Remove the Old Bowden Tube

Next, use pliers to remove the old Bowden tube from the printer. Be sure to cut off any melted or damaged parts of the tube before removing it fully.

Step 4: Install the New Nozzle

Using a hex wrench, screw the new nozzle into place. Make sure it's threaded all the way in, but don't overtighten it.

Step 5: Install the New Bowden Tube

Slide the new Bowden tube into place, making sure it's properly seated at the nozzle end and the spool end.

Step 6: Test Your Printer

With the new components installed, turn on your printer and run a test print to make sure everything's working as it should.

Final Thoughts

With just a few simple steps, you can replace the nozzle and Bowden tube in your CR 10S Pro and ensure that your printer is running as smoothly as possible. This hack is a great way to keep your printer in top condition and could save you time and frustration in the long run. Happy printing!

## Chosen Solution
 I am looking for someone to help tweek my 3d printer. I recently had to change a nozzle from a clog and it is not printing as good as before the clog. I live in RI. I can bring my printer to them ot they can come to my house.Thanks

 Hello! so to replace the bowden tube and nozzle, you want to heat up the nozzle to around 170C. then use the small wrench in your creality kit to unscrew the nozzle (youll need to unscrew it clockwise i think)
to remove the bowden tube, you'll need to
first remove the blue clips from the tube (from the extruder side and the hotend side)
push down in the white plastic nut/part till you hear a soft click
pull the tube you
another way is to use the large wrench to unscrew the big nut on either side of the tube
