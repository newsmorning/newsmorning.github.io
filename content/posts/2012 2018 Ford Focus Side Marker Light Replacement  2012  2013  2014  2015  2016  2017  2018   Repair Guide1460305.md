# Say Goodbye to Your Ford Focus Blinker Woes - Quick & Easy Side Marker Light Fix for All 2012-2018 Models!

If you’re a Ford Focus owner, you know that the side marker lights can be a real pain to deal with. Whether they’re burnt out or not working properly, it seems like they always end up causing headaches. Luckily, there’s an easy solution that won’t break the bank or require a trip to the mechanic.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to fix your side marker light issues in just a few minutes:

## Tools You’ll Need

- Flathead screwdriver
- Pliers
- Replacement side marker light (available at most auto parts stores or online)

## Step 1: Remove the Old Side Marker Light

Use your flathead screwdriver to gently pry off the side marker light cover. It should come off fairly easily. Once the cover is removed, you’ll see the light bulb and wires. Use your pliers to carefully remove the light bulb from the socket. Be sure not to break it, as you’ll need it for the replacement.

## Step 2: Install the New Side Marker Light

Take your replacement side marker light and insert the light bulb into the socket. Be careful not to touch the bulb with your bare hands, as this can cause it to burn out faster. Once the bulb is inserted, carefully align the light with the socket and press it into place. You should hear a clicking sound when it’s secure.

## Step 3: Test the Light

Before you put the cover back on, test the new side marker light to make sure it’s working properly. Turn on your headlights and use your turn signal to make sure the light is blinking as it should. If everything is working correctly, you can replace the cover and move on to the next side marker light.

## Final Thoughts

This quick and easy fix will save you a lot of time and money compared to going to a mechanic. Most side marker lights cost just a few dollars, and the whole process shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. With this guide, you’ll be able to say goodbye to your Ford Focus blinker woes for good!

## Introduction
 
Side marker lights are auxiliary safety lights that clearly show other drivers your vehicle's location and direction of travel from a variety of angles. Without this bulb there is an additional risk while driving that other's on the road will not be alerted to your presence during the night or other obscure environments.
 
Step 7-8 requires you to handle the glass bulb. It is important to remember proper handling of glass during these steps.
 
Before beginning, make sure to turn off your car completely.
