OMG! Shocking iPad Pro 12.9 Keyboard Disaster - Broken Hinge Causes Major Chaos!

As an avid iPad Pro 12.9 user, it's hard not to notice the surge of reviews and comments flooding social media regarding the recent keyboard disaster. Many users, including myself, have had an awful experience with the new iPad Pro 12.9 keyboard, with complaints of broken hinges and major chaos ensue.

It all started when Apple announced a new iPad Pro 12.9 earlier this year, promising a sleek and seamless iPad experience with a new and improved keyboard that would further enhance the tablet's productivity. The keyboard featured a thinner design and a magnetic hinge that held the iPad in place, making it easy to type like a true laptop.

Unfortunately, the design of the new iPad Pro 12.9 keyboard was not as robust as users had hoped. Many users complained that the hinge was not strong enough to support the weight of the iPad Pro, causing it to snap off or become loose easily.

This broken hinge design issue has resulted in multiple chaos for users, ranging from an inability to keep the iPad in place while typing to frustration from constantly having to reattach the hinge. Many users have also noted the sheer cost of having to replace an already expensive device, as the iPad Pro 12.9 starting at $1,099, and the keyboard costing a whopping $349.

One could argue that Apple's decision to design their newest iPad Pro with a detachable keyboard may have been shortsighted since it ultimately added even more stress to an already fragile device. While users had hoped for a sleek and seamless gadget, the poor design of the iPad Pro 12.9 keyboard has proved to be nothing more than a major frustration.

In conclusion, it's clear that the newest iPad Pro 12.9 keyboard was a design flaw that Apple will need to address promptly to keep their customer base satisfied. The company has yet to release an official statement or plan for how they plan on remedying the issue, but it's clear that users seeking to purchase an iPad Pro 12.9 should do so with caution, keeping in mind the potential keypad design flaw. Apple has a reputation for its high-quality products and customer satisfaction, and it's important that they address these concerns if they hope to maintain that reputation.

 The top left key on mine just fell off ( ` ~ ) and has a broken peg so will not go back on. Apple told me, without any kind of inspection, they would not cover it and I could pay $387.92 to have it repaired. I have had it for just about 45 days.

 You can use the Apple care of your iPad to get it fixed. I hope you added the Apple care within 60 days.
