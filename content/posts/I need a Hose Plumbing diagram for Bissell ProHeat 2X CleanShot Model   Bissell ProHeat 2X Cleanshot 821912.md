## Chosen Solution
 I was given a Model #9500 after a friend tore it down and could not put it back together. I have found the service center guide for the Model 9200 thru 9400 but it is not the exact same as the #9500. The difference is the flow gauge plumbing.
Thanks in advance.

 Hi everyone, don’t know if you’re talking about that. But recently I had a problem so I called a plumber agency. I really wanted to recommend it cause the guy that came was so nice, no sex ? or something like that. He just was nice and fixed the issue really fast. I liked that a lot. I think they deserve much more clients. Here’s the site ++https://fastplumbers.net.au/.++ This agency is super cool. I know everyone gets to have this kid of problem so I hope this will be useful to you. Have a nice day guys. Hope I helped anyone.
