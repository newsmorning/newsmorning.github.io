Title: Unlock Financial Freedom by Understanding Deferred Income Tax

If you’re like most people, you probably file your tax return every year and move on with your life. But did you know that by not taking advantage of deferred income tax, you could be losing out on thousands of dollars in potential savings?

Deferred income tax is a tax strategy commonly used by businesses, but also available to individuals, which allows you to defer paying taxes on some of your income until a later date. This is particularly useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in the future than you are now.

For example, imagine you have a traditional IRA or 401(k) retirement account. Any money you put into these accounts is tax-deferred – meaning you don’t have to pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. The idea behind this is that when you retire, you’ll likely be in a lower tax bracket than you are now, so you’ll pay less in taxes overall.

Another way to take advantage of deferred income tax is through a Health Savings Account (HSA). Here, you can contribute pre-tax dollars to pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance. Any unused funds can be rolled over year-to-year and continue to grow tax-free. Once you reach retirement age, you can withdraw funds penalty-free for non-medical expenses, but you will be required to pay regular income tax on the distributed funds.

By deferring taxes on some of your income, you can potentially pay less in taxes overall and increase your savings rate. But, how do you calculate how much to defer?

First, it’s important to understand your tax bracket and where you anticipate being in the future. If you expect your income to decrease in the coming years - say, after you retire - deferring taxes on some of your income may be a good strategy. 

Next, consider how much of your income you can realistically defer. Tax laws limit how much you can contribute to retirement and HSA accounts each year, so be sure to check the latest contribution limits. Additionally, consider any potential penalties or fees you may incur for early withdrawals.

Finally, it’s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to ensure you’re making the most informed decision for your specific situation.

In conclusion, if you’re not taking advantage of deferred income tax, you could be missing out on thousands of dollars in potential savings. By understanding your future tax bracket, considering contribution limits and potential fees, and seeking guidance from a professional, you can unlock financial freedom and make the most of your hard-earned money.

### Causes of Deferred Income Tax Expense

It is not tracked by analysts or stakeholders & its calculation is relevant only to evaluate a Company’s tax liability. read more and the taxable profit.

- Permanent Difference: The differences which cannot be reversed in the subsequent periods and may take a long time are permanent.Temporary Difference: The difference which can be reversed in the subsequent period and is generally created because the items are charged and taxed in different periods is the temporary difference.

 
Let us discuss the two types of Deferred Income Tax expenses in detail.
 
### 1) Deferred Income Tax Asset
 
A deferred tax asset is created when the Company has already paid the tax. The benefit of deferred tax assets is that the Company will have less tax outgo in subsequent years.
 
#### Example
 
Consider an Electronics Company XYZ Inc., which gives a warranty on the goods and assumes that the warranty repairs cost will go around 5% of the total revenue. If the revenue for the period is $ 500,000, then the balance sheet of the Company to the shareholders and the tax department will be:
 
Balance Sheet for Shareholders
 
Balance Sheet for Tax Authorities
 
The Company has already paid a tax difference of $ 6,250 but is not visible on the balance sheet. Thus, it will record a deferred tax asset of $ 6,250 for the period.
 
### 2) Deferred Income Tax Liability 
 
Deferred tax liability is created when the Company underpays the tax, which it will have to pay shortly. The liability is created not due to Company defaulting on its tax liabilities but due to timing mismatch or accounting provisionsAccounting ProvisionsThe provision in accounting refers to an amount or obligation set aside by the business for present and future commitments. Provisions are estimates of future related probable losses from past and present events calculated by following predefined regulatory guidelines by banks and financial institutions.read more, which causes less tax outgo than required by the Company.
 
An Oil Company, ABC Inc, produces 10,000 barrels of oil at the cost of $ 15 per barrel 1st year. But in the next year, the labor cost increased, and it produced the same amount of oil but at the cost of $ 20. The Company sold the oil at the end of year two but used different accounting treatments for financial and tax purposes. It recorded the cost as $ 150,000 FIFO inventoryFIFO InventoryUnder the FIFO method of accounting inventory valuation, the goods that are purchased first are the first to be removed from the inventory account. As a result, leftover inventory at books is valued at the most recent price paid for the most recent stock of inventory. As a result, the inventory asset on the balance sheet is recorded at the most recent cost.read more for the financial balance sheet, where it recorded the cost as $ 200,000 for tax purposes LIFO inventoryLIFO InventoryLIFO (Last In First Out) is one accounting method for inventory valuation on the balance sheet. LIFO accounting means inventory acquired at last would be used up or sold first.read more. It created a temporary difference of $ 50,000, and if the tax rate is 30% would create a tax liability of $ 15,000.
