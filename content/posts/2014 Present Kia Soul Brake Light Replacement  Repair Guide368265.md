# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Replace Your 2014 Kia Soul Brake Light - Step-by-Step Guide Inside!

Brake lights are crucial components of your Kia Soul's safety system. These lights signal other drivers to slow down or stop, giving them enough time to react to your vehicle's movements. If one of your brake lights is not working, you can be at risk of an accident or even a ticket.

Changing the brake light on your Kia Soul may seem daunting, but the process is relatively simple. In this guide, we will show you how to replace your 2014 Kia Soul brake light in a few easy steps.

## What You Will Need

Here are the tools you will need to change your Kia's brake light:

- Replacement brake light
- Screwdriver
- Paper towel or cloth
- Plastic trim removal tool (optional)

## Step 1: Open the Trunk

Start by accessing the back of your Kia Soul. Open the trunk and locate the brake light assembly. This is where you will find the brake light bulb that needs replacement.

## Step 2: Remove the Brake Light Cover

Using a screwdriver, carefully remove the screws that hold the brake light cover in place. You may also use a plastic trim removal tool to prevent scratches on the paint. Once you've removed the screws, gently remove the cover, being careful not to damage the gasket.

## Step 3: Remove the Old Brake Light

Next, you will need to remove the old brake light bulb. Gently rotate the bulb, then pull it out of the socket. To make sure that you are removing the correct bulb, you can consult your Kia owner's manual.

## Step 4: Install the New Brake Light

With the old brake light bulb removed, it's time to install the new one. Simply insert the new brake light bulb into the socket, making sure it's seated correctly.

## Step 5: Reattach the Brake Light Cover

With the new brake light bulb installed, it's time to reattach the brake light cover. Line up the cover with the assembly and screw it back into place. Make sure that the gasket is in the proper position and that the screws are secure.

## Step 6: Test Your Brake Light

To make sure that your new brake light is working correctly, turn on your Kia Soul's headlights and press the brake pedal. Check that all your brake lights are working correctly before closing the trunk.

Congratulations! You've successfully replaced your 2014 Kia Soul brake light.

## Final Thoughts

Replacing your Kia Soul's brake light is a simple process that you can do yourself without the need for professional help. With this step-by-step guide, you can save time and money and ensure the safety of you and your passengers. If you're experiencing problems with other parts of your Kia's safety system, like its brakes or tires, it's always best to consult a professional mechanic.

## Introduction
 
When the brake light does not turn on, something is wrong with the light bulb, electric system, or socket. A burnt out bulb is one of the most common brake light problems.
 
Before replacing the light bulb make sure you clean the out the socket with something like a used toothbrush for example. Brush out any dust or rust that could prevent a good connection between the light bulb and the socket.
 
If, after placing the new light bulb it still does not turn on, the problem could be more serious and may involve the electrical system.  In that case you might need to see a mechanic.
 
Step 3 should be done in a warm temperature. If it is cold, do it in a warm garage that will prevent you from breaking the plastic lens cover.
 
Make sure you turn the engine off and put the emergency break on prior to beginning the guide.
