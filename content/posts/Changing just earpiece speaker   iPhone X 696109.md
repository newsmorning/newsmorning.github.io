# You Won't Believe the Surprising Benefit of Changing Just the Earpiece Speaker on Your iPhone X!

Do you have an iPhone X with a broken earpiece speaker? Are you thinking of getting a new phone or repairing it? Either way, you may not be aware of the surprising benefit of changing just the earpiece speaker on your iPhone X. In this article, we'll explore how changing the earpiece speaker can improve more than just the sound quality of your iPhone X.

## Understanding the Earpiece Speaker

Before we dive into the benefits, let's first understand what the earpiece speaker is and how it works. The earpiece speaker is a small speaker located at the top of the iPhone X above the screen. When you make a call, the sound waves from the person you're speaking with are converted into electrical signals that are amplified and broadcasted through the earpiece speaker.

## Benefits of a New Earpiece Speaker

1. Improved Sound Quality: One of the most obvious benefits of changing the earpiece speaker on your iPhone X is improved sound quality. A new earpiece speaker can make a significant difference in the clarity and volume of the sound you hear during calls.

2. Longer Battery Life: Believe it or not, replacing the earpiece speaker can help your iPhone X's battery last longer. A damaged or old speaker can draw more power from the battery, leading to decreased battery life. A new earpiece speaker that's more efficient can help your phone run longer without needing a charge.

3. Better Call Reception: Your earpiece speaker isn't just responsible for broadcasting sound, it's also involved in receiving it. A new speaker can improve call reception and make it easier to hear the person on the other end of the line.

4. Resell Value: If you're planning on selling your iPhone X, a new earpiece speaker can increase its resell value. Potential buyers are more likely to pay top dollar for a phone with a new speaker that's in excellent working condition.

## How to Replace the Earpiece Speaker

If you're interested in replacing your iPhone X's earpiece speaker, the process is relatively simple. You'll need to purchase a replacement speaker and follow these steps:

1. Power off your iPhone X.
2. Remove the two screws located at the bottom of the phone.
3. Use a heat gun or blow dryer to warm up the screen adhesive.
4. Use a suction cup to separate the screen from the body of the phone. Be careful not to damage the cables.
5. Remove the screws and cables that connect the screen to the body of the phone.
6. Remove the old earpiece speaker and install the new one.
7. Reverse the above steps to reassemble your phone.

If you're not comfortable with this process, you can take your iPhone X to a repair shop or Apple store to have it replaced.

In conclusion, changing the earpiece speaker on your iPhone X can provide surprising benefits beyond just improving the sound quality. From longer battery life to better call reception, a new speaker can make a significant difference in your phone's performance. If you're experiencing problems with your earpiece speaker, consider replacing it before buying a new phone. You won't believe the difference it can make!

## Chosen Solution
 Is it possible to just change the war phone speaker itself? Face ID and everything works but the earpiece speaker when on a call works but is very tinny. Is it possible? I donâ€™t have an X at hand to strip and check the part.

 Yes, it can be done but it requires some soldering skills. If the volume is very low, then most likely the filter is all clogged up, the black mesh between the speaker and your ear. Open the phone, disassemble the proximity sensor flex (3 screws), and clean the filter with an old toothbrush and some isopropilic alcohol.
The best way to know if it is clean is holding it up against some light.
