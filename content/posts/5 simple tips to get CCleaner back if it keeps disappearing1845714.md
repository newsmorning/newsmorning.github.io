# Never Lose Ccleaner Again: Learn These 5 Simple Tips for Retaining Your Favorite PC Tool Today!

If you are one of those people who rely on the Ccleaner app on your PC for regular system cleaning, you must always want to keep it at hand. Right? However, it is quite common for users to lose any software, including Ccleaner. For instance, you may have uninstalled the app unknowingly, or a hardware failure might have led to its disappearance. But, no worries! In this article, we would like to share with you five simple tips that can help you retain your favorite PC tool. Let’s dive in!

## 1. Always Download Ccleaner from the Official Website

While Ccleaner is an amazing utility tool, it is important to stay cautious while downloading it. Often, unsuspecting users download the app from unverified or third-party websites, which leads to downloading fake/spurious apps or even malware that can harm your system. Therefore, always download the Ccleaner app from the official website, [ccleaner.com](https://www.ccleaner.com/).

## 2. Create a Backup

Another great option is to create a backup of your Ccleaner app. You can do this by simply copying the app file from its installed directory and storing it in an external drive, cloud storage, or a USB stick. This way, even if you uninstall the app accidentally, you can easily reinstall it from the backup.

## 3. Install and Enable Automatic Updates

To ensure that you are using the latest version of Ccleaner to keep your system clean, it is essential to install and enable the automatic updates feature. This will keep you from not only losing the app but also help you avoid the risk of security vulnerabilities.

## 4. Register Your Ccleaner App

Registering your Ccleaner app can be another great way to ensure its safety. By registering, you can receive updates and notifications directly from the developers. That way, you will never miss out on any new features and functionalities!

## 5. Keep a Shortcut Icon

Lastly, keeping a shortcut icon of the Ccleaner app is another simple way to remember it. You can create a shortcut for the app by selecting the app's .exe file from the installed directory and dragging it to your desktop. This shortcut will act as a quick access point for your app, always reminding you of its presence.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, losing your favorite PC tool, Ccleaner, can be frustrating, but with these tips, you can ensure that you never lose it again. Always download from the official site, create backups, install and enable automatic updates, register the app, and keep a shortcut icon. Implementing these simple tips can prevent you from losing the app and saving you multiple hours of searching, reinstalling, and configuring it again. Happy cleaning!

Now that you know what’s causing the problem, let’s walk you through the most effective fixes if CCleaner keeps disappearing on your PC.
 
## What can I do if CCleaner keeps disappearing?
 
### 1. Update Windows
 
- Press Windows + I to launch the Settings app, and select Windows Update from the tabs listed in the navigation pane on the left.
 - Now, click on the Check for updates button on the right to scan for any available new versions of the OS.
 - If any updates are listed after the scan, click on Download & install.

 
A quick way to eliminate a plethora of errors in Windows, including CCleaner keeps disappearing, is to keep the OS up-to-date. Whenever a bug is reported, Microsoft releases a patch for it in the subsequent updates. So, make sure to have the latest version installed.
 
### 2. Launch CCleaner in Safe Mode and then back in regular mode
 
- Press the Windows key to launch the Start menu, click on the Power icon, hold the Shift key and then click Restart from the flyout menu.
 - Wait for the OS to enter the Recovery Environment, and then click on Troubleshoot.
 - Now, select Advanced options.
 - Select Startup Settings from the six options listed here.
 - Click Restart.
 - Now, either hit the 4 or F4 key to boot Windows into Safe Mode.
 - Next, open CCleaner in Safe Mode and let it run for a minute or two.
 - Finally, restart the PC to boot Windows into regular mode.

 
Once in the regular mode, you should now be able to run CCleaner and it shouldn’t keep disappearing anymore. If this method doesn’t work, head to the next one.
 
### 3. Disable/uninstall antivirus

 - Now, locate the problematic app, click on the ellipsis next to it, and select Uninstall from the flyout menu.
 - Again, click Uninstall in the confirmation prompt that pops up.

 
The antivirus is often found to block the functioning of CCleaner which leads to it immediately disappearing after launch. McAfee has been reported to cause the issue by many, so make sure to disable/uninstall it.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.
