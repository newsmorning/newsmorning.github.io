 You might need to change your IP address from automatic to manual.
IP addresses within a network will be something like 192.168.x.x
Subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0
Try to find out what the IP address is for another device (say another laptop that connects to the wifi)
If it is, say, 192.168.2.8, you can go with that same range and assign an IP address like 192.168.2.30 or something.
