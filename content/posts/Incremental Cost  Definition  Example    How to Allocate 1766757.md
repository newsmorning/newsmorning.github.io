Introduction:
Saving money is a crucial aspect of living a financially stable life. However, it takes discipline, knowledge, and skill to allocate incremental costs like a pro. Once you get the hang of it, you can significantly increase your savings and achieve your long-term financial goals. In this article, we will explore an essential concept of allocating incremental costs and how it can help you to save money like a pro.


Body:
What are incremental costs?
Incremental costs are the additional expenses that come as a result of producing or selling one more unit of a product or service. These costs include the cost of raw materials, labor, packaging, transportation, and more. Understanding incremental costs is essential for businesses who want to expand their operations, but it is also useful for individuals who want to save money.

How to allocate incremental costs?
Allocating incremental costs requires a good understanding of the cost structure of the product or service. The easiest way to allocate incremental costs is to use the marginal cost formula, which is:

Marginal cost = (Change in total cost) / (Change in quantity)

For example, suppose you want to know the incremental cost of producing five more units of a product. You have to calculate the difference in total cost between producing five and ten units and divide it by five. The resulting figure is the incremental cost per unit.

Why is it crucial to allocate incremental costs?
Allocating incremental costs is crucial because it allows businesses to determine the profitability of their products or services. By understanding incremental costs, businesses can identify which products are more profitable and which ones are not. This knowledge can help them to make informed decisions about pricing, production, and investment.

For individuals, allocating incremental costs can be equally important. When you understand the incremental cost of each unit of a product or service, you can make better purchasing decisions. For example, if you know that the incremental cost of a store-bought sandwich is too high, you might opt to make your sandwich at home instead of buying one.

Conclusion:
Understanding incremental costs and how to allocate them is an essential tool for saving money. Whether you are a business owner or an individual, knowing the marginal cost of your products or services can help you to make better financial decisions. The key is to take the time to calculate the incremental costs accurately, so you have an accurate picture of your expenses. With this knowledge, you can unlock the secret to saving money like a pro.

### Example
 
Let’s take an example to understand this better:
 
Assuming a manufacturing company, ABC Ltd. has a production unit where the cost incurred in making 100 units of a product X is ₹ 2,000. The company wants to add another product, ‘Y,’ for which it incurs some cost in terms of salary to the additional labor force, raw materials, and assuming that there was no machinery, equipment, etc., added.
 
Let’s suppose now, after adding the new product line, it can produce 200 units at  ₹ 3500, so here the incremental cost is ₹ 1,500
 
Like in the above example, it is evident that the per-unit cost of manufacturing the products has decreased from ₹ 20 to  ₹ 17.5 after introducing the new product line. However, this may not be true in all cases. Identifying such costs is very important for companies as it helps them decide whether the additional cost is in their best interest.
 
It is not necessary that such costs can only be variable. EvenFixed Cost refers to the cost or expense that is not affected by any decrease or increase in the number of units produced or sold over a short-term horizon. It is the type of cost which is not dependent on the business activity.read more fixed costsFixed CostsFixed Cost refers to the cost or expense that is not affected by any decrease or increase in the number of units produced or sold over a short-term horizon.

### Allocation of Incremental Costs
 
The basic method of allocation of incremental cost is to assign a primary user and the additional or incremental user of the total cost.
 
If we look at our above example, the primary user is product ‘X’ which was already being manufactured at the plant and utilizing the machinery and equipment. The new product only added some extra cost to define ‘X’ as the primary user and ‘Y’ as the incremental user.
 
In the absence of any new product or any additional unit, the total cost that ABC Ltd. incurred while manufacturing only ‘X’ is ₹2,000, so we’ll allocate this costAllocate This CostCost Allocation is the procedure of recognizing & assigning costs to different cost objects like a product, department, program, customer, etc., as per the cost driver serving as the base for this process. read more to X,
 
The additional cost of ₹ 1,500, incurred only to introduce the new product, will be allocated to ‘Y.’
 
This allocation can even change in the future course of business of ABC Ltd. when supposedly, if it chooses to drop product ‘X,’ then product ‘Y’ or any other product might become the primary user of the cost.
 
Incremental costs are also associated with the changes in the product’s pricing. Let’s suppose if the overall cost per unit of a product is also increasing by incurring such cost, then the company would want to change the price of the product to maintain or increase the profit. It might work in or against the favor of the company. Such companies are said to have diseconomies of scaleDiseconomies Of ScaleDiseconomies of scale is a state that generally occurs when an enterprise expands in size. The average operating cost increases due to inefficiency in the system, employee incoordination, administration & management issues, and delayed decisions.read more, i.e., they have already reached the maximum limit of production volume.
 
But if the per-unit cost or average cost is decreasing by incurring the incremental cost, the company might be able to reduce the price of the product and enjoy selling more units. Such companies are said to have economies of scale, whereby there is some scope available to optimize the utility of production.
 
Considering that the price of each unit of product ‘X’ is ₹ 25, the profit initially was
 
Net Profit = ₹ 500
 
Also, considering after introducing the new product line, the price for both ‘X’ and ‘Y’ is kept at ₹ 25, the profit here will be:
 
- Net Profit =(200 X 25) – (200 X 17.5)Net Profit = ₹ 1500

 
To increase the sales to gain more market share, the company can leverage the lower cost per unit of the product to lower the price from ₹ 25 and sell more units at a lower price.
 
### Incremental Costs vs. Margin Costs
 
Incremental costs are also referred to as marginal costsMarginal CostsMarginal cost formula helps in calculating the value of increase or decrease of the total production cost of the company during the period under consideration if there is a change in output by one extra unit. It is calculated by dividing the change in the costs by the change in quantity.read more, but there are some basic differences between them.
 
- Incremental costs are mostly associated with choices or decisions and therefore include only those additional costs caused due to the decision made; for example, it does not consider the cost of machinery or equipment which was already there in the production unit, which is also referred to as sunk cost because these costs will remain regardless of any decision.On the other hand, Marginal cost specifically takes into account the increase in cost for producing one additional unit. It is often used to optimize production, while the incremental cost is not an optimization tool.

 
### Conclusion
 
Companies can broadly use the incremental cost to analyze the following:

Typically, companies extend their product offerings by adding new variants to the existing products with the expectation that the existing consumers will buy products from the brands that they are already purchasing.read more in the house or to outsource itWhether to accept a one-off high volume order from the customer or business partnerWhether to allocate the available resources to optimize their utilizationWhether to change the price of a product
