Title: The iPhone XS Dilemma: Face ID and Speaker Calls No Longer Working!

Introduction
Apple's latest flagship phone, the iPhone XS, has been a bestseller since its release. However, the phone has been facing several issues since it came out that have left users extremely frustrated. The latest problem is perhaps the most concerning one yet, as many iPhone XS users are reporting that the Face ID and speaker calls are no longer functioning on their devices. The issue is causing significant problems for people who rely heavily on these features.

What is Face ID, and Why is it Important?
Face ID is a biometric authentication feature that enables the user to unlock their phone and access various applications by simply looking at the screen. It uses a facial recognition system that analyzes the user's facial features using infrared technology. This feature has become a significant selling point for Apple's latest range of devices, and people rely on it to secure their private data.

The Importance of Speaker Calls
Speaker calls are another critical feature on the iPhone XS that allows users to make and receive phone calls, FaceTime calls, and Siri interactions using the speakerphone setting. This feature is especially handy for those who multitask and need to have their hands free while on a call.

The Latest Glitch on the iPhone XS
Several reports suggest that the iPhone XS's Face ID and speaker call features have stopped working for some users. Many users have reported that their phones' speaker does not play any sound during calls, and the receiver cannot hear anything they say. Simultaneously, some users have experienced issues with the Face ID feature not unlocking their phone or authenticating their identity, even when they gesture in front of the camera.

How Can You Fix the Problem?
Apple has acknowledged the issue and is working on a fix for these features. However, it is not entirely clear when it will be released. In the meantime, Apple has suggested that users reset their device's settings to resolve the problem. This option can be found under Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. Users are advised to back up their device data before resetting settings, as this process will erase all customizations and saved content.

Conclusion
The iPhone XS Dilemma: Face ID and speaker calls no longer functioning has brought a significant inconvenience to many iPhone XS users over the past few weeks. While Apple is working on a solution for this issue, it is essential that users follow the manufacturer's recommendations to reset their device settings. Apple is known for its excellent customer service, and it will do everything in its power to resolve this problem as soon as possible.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello, i recently changed the front speaker of an iPhone XS Max (the one you use on calls near your ear) and Face ID stopped working, i checked multiple times all the sensors that comes with the speaker, restarted the phone and nothing. I didnt touched the screen because it was working flawlessly. My only assumption is that the part has a failure? Probably with another speaker it will work?

 Did you replace the whole assembly or solder on a new speaker. The proximity and flood sensor are paired to the phone and if you change that assembly face Id will not work. Also if you change the original from camera face Id will not work.
