Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When This Gamer's Charger Broke Off in Their Nintendo DSi XL!

Introduction:

It's a gamer's worst nightmare: the moment you realize that your charger has broken off inside your console. That's exactly what happened to me when I was playing on my Nintendo DSi XL one day. I was in the middle of a game when I accidentally yanked on the charger cable, causing it to snap off inside the charging port. I was devastated. How was I supposed to fix this? Would my beloved DSi XL ever work properly again?

Body:

After a few moments of panic, I decided to try to remove the broken charger myself. I knew that if I wasn't careful, I could cause even more damage to the console. But I couldn't just leave the charger lodged inside the port. I needed to try to remove it somehow.

I tried a few different methods, but nothing seemed to work. I tried using pliers to grip the broken connector and pull it out, but it was stuck tight. I tried using a toothpick to carefully maneuver the broken pieces, but that just made the situation worse. I was getting frustrated and worried that I had permanently damaged my DSi XL.

That's when I decided to do some research online. I scoured message boards, online forums, and gaming websites. After a while of searching, I came across a solution that seemed too good to be true: using a hot glue gun to remove the broken charger.

At first, I was skeptical. How could hot glue possibly help me remove the charger? But I decided to give it a try. I applied the hot glue around the broken connector and waited for it to dry completely. Once it was dry, I gently pulled on the glue, and to my surprise, the broken charger came out with ease!

I was ecstatic. My DSi XL was working perfectly again, and I had solved the problem myself. It just goes to show that sometimes you can find unexpected solutions to your problems when you're willing to do a little research and experimentation.

Conclusion:

Breaking your charger off inside your console is never a fun experience. But with a little patience and creativity, you can solve the problem and get your gaming system back up and running. In my case, using a hot glue gun was the surprising solution that saved my DSi XL. So the next time you find yourself in a similar situation, don't panic. There might just be a clever solution out there waiting for you to discover it.

## Chosen Solution
 What can I do to fix it , I have a lot of DS games and don't want to get rid of them and the DS . Where can I get it fixed

 Remove the battery and get some fine point tweezers to see if you can remove the charger piece from the outside. If you're not able to remove it that way, then open up the bottom shell and try to push the piece out from inside the system. If you still cannot get the piece out then you'll need to desolder the charge port and put a new one back on. It's not a terrible soldering job and a new charge port is pretty cheap off eBay.
