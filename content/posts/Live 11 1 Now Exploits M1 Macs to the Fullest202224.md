Revolutionary Software Alert: Live 11 Takes M1 Macs to Unprecedented Heights!

In the tech world, change is the only constant. As soon as you think you have a grasp on the latest advances, something even more groundbreaking comes along. And that's exactly what's happened with Live 11 - the latest version of Ableton's flagship digital audio workstation (DAW).

With Live 11, Ableton has achieved a remarkable technological feat. It has brought the power of M1 Macs to unprecedented heights, revolutionizing the music production process for professionals worldwide.

The M1 chip is a game-changer in the world of computing. It combines the central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), and other components into a single chip. This means that M1 Macs have superior performance capabilities that are faster and more efficient than any other computer architecture.

M1 Macs' processing power is especially impactful for audio production, where demands are incredibly high. Live 11 harnesses this power to deliver a lightning-fast experience, allowing producers to work with large audio files without any lag.

Live 11 is also the first DAW designed specifically for M1 Macs. The integration of M1 technology allowed Ableton to introduce several features unique to this new platform. This includes faster launch times, more efficient CPU usage, and an overall smoother experience for producers.

In terms of interface and functionality, Live 11 has several new features that have been widely praised by the music production community. These include new and better-sounding versions of many effects, new Hybrid Reverb algorithms, and creative MIDI tools such as Scale and Chord.

But it's the improvements in the core functionality of Live 11 that makes it truly standout. Specifically, Live 11 has a much-improved and more nuanced MIDI editor, making it easier to work with instrument racks and automate MIDI clips. Additionally, the revamped clip editing experience allows for much faster and more intuitive manipulation of audio.

In a nutshell, Live 11's integration with M1 Macs has delivered unprecedented processing power, making it one of the most sought-after tools for music production in the industry today. The possibilities it opens up for music production are endless, and with its intuitive design, it's never been easier to create professional-quality tracks.

The incorporation of M1 technology in Live 11 is just one of the many examples of how technology is transforming music production. As the industry continues to evolve, it's essential to embrace new tools and technology. And when it comes to music production, Live 11 represents the very cutting edge of innovation.

Ableton Live 11.1 is a huge deal for any musician who bought a Mac in the last year—it's now optimized for Apple's M1 chips. 

 
### 
Key Takeaways
 
- Ableton Live now runs as a Universal app on Apple Silicon Macs. Live 11.1 also brings new updates to its built-in features.Older plugins will not load on M1 Macs, but there’s a workaround.

 

Musicians might be all leather jackets, Jack Daniel's, and sleeping past noon, but they're a conservative bunch regarding gear—especially software. The golden rule is to never upgrade a working setup unless you have to. But if you use Ableton Live on any recent Mac, you should run, not walk, to the update page. Now that it supports Apple Silicon, Live is faster and uses way less CPU. But it's not all good news—if you rely on old plugins for your music, you may be in for a disappointment. 

 

"So far, it's flawless. CPU meter seems much more stable and is sitting a good 20-30% lower in the more hectic parts of large projects," musician and Ableton user Evpat told Lifewire in a forum post. "I am also experiencing fewer spikes/dropouts while using other programs simultaneously. I like to listen to my tracks while doing other tasks, and audio dropouts used to be frequent when having a few Chrome tabs open and scrolling around, etc. but not anymore."

 
##   Live Fast  
 

Ableton Live is one of the most creative Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) around. It lets you dig in and edit everything, just like Pro Tools and Logic Pro, but it is also geared heavily towards live performance, hence its name. Being able to run a complex project on a lightweight laptop is essential. 

 

Live 11.1 can now run directly on Apple Silicon Macs without using the Rosetta 2 translation layer that lets M1 Macs run older apps compiled for Intel chips. The result of this is a massive performance boost. Live was already pretty snappy on the new Macs because they are so snappy themselves. But the word across the music forums is that the app is not only running smoother but is also using far fewer resources. 

 
“The performance improvement is very noticeable."
 

That is, Live now idles the computer's CPU where previously it would rev the engine, even when doing nothing. "Base CPU usage in previous versions of Live was around 27%. Now it's 5%," says Ableton user and musician Badbass in the Elektronauts forum. 

 

This is good in abstract terms, but Live tends to encourage the use of lots of live effects and processing to create some wild music. The CPU reductions we're seeing reported are better than buying a whole new computer for many people. And on M1 Macs, this combines with the already-impressive power and long battery life to create perhaps the ultimate portable music studio. 

 
##   Plugin Perils  
 

It’s not all great news, though. Ableton, like all DAWs, lets you use plugins, which are third-party music apps that run inside the main app. Many have been updated to run on apple Silicon, but many have not. And those will not load in Ableton Live 11.1. If you have a project that was running fine yesterday, and you update, then your project will be broken. That’s precisely why musicians like to hold off updating for as long as possible. 

 

But there is a workaround. You can launch Live in Rosetta 2, Apple’s translation layer mentioned above. The problem is that Intel plugins cannot run inside an M1 host. So if you relaunch Live using its Intel-compatible version, those plugins will run again. 

 

That’s a good workaround until your favorite plugins are updated. You lose some of the performance boost, but not all. Musician and Elektronauts forum member v00d00ppl uses an older Intel Mac and still gets an impressive jump.

 

“The performance improvement is very noticeable. On my 2017 iMac Pro, I was getting 27-30% CPU on single tracks sometimes. Now I am running at 3-5% depending on what’s going on,” says v00d00ppl in the Elektronauts forum.

 

And Live still doesn’t support AUv3 plugins, which are the latest version of the Audio Unit plugins favored on Apple platforms. That’s not usually a big deal because plugin developers typically release their software in alternative formats, like VST, that are compatible with any host. But AUv3 is also the plugin format used on iOS.

 

There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of great AUv3 apps on the iPad, and many of those apps can run on M1 Macs now. If you use Apple’s Logic, you can load those plugins, which is pretty wild. In Ableton, you cannot. 

 

But this is still a milestone release for Live. M1 Mac-owning musicians are going to be very happy.
