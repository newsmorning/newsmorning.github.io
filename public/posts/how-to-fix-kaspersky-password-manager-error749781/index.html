Uninstall and install the application once again To uninstall the current version of Kaspersky Password Manager, first, open the Control Panel. Go to Programs and Features. Select your Kaspersky application and click Uninstall/Change. If the application is password-protected, enter the password. Click Continue. Click Next. Select the checkboxes beside the data you want to save and click Next again. Download the installer for Kaspersky Password Manager. Click Remove. Reboot the computer. It’s time to install the application once again. Start by downloading the installer from the official Kaspersky website. Run the .exe file. Select the appropriate language and click Install. Read the Kaspersky Lab End User License Agreement and the Privacy Policy notifications. Select the checkboxes if you agree to their terms. Click Accept. Also, read the Statement regarding data processing for marketing purposes. If you agree with the terms, click Accept. You may also click Cancel if you don’t want your data to be used for marketing purposes. Enter your Kaspersky account details and click Sign In.

This might not be music to your ears, but you can obviously disable studies again after your add-ons have been re-enabled.\nAs tempting as it may be, don’t delete your add-ons as this means that you are willing to lose any data related to the add-on too.\n3.
