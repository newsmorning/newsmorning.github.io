## Key Specs: Infinix Hot 12i
 
One main reason why you might want to get this smartphone is its processor. Not very often do we see budget smartphones like the Infinix Hot 12i feature a premium processor like the Mediatek helio G85. You only find this processor on mid-range and premium smartphones. The processor comes with two fast ARM Cortex-A75 cores (with up to 2 GHz) and six small ARM Cortex-A55 (with up to 1.8 GHz). This simply means this device will efficiently handle tasks thrown at it – and that includes graphic and CPU demanding mobile games. 
 
The design of the Infinix Hot 12i is similar to its predecessor, the Infinix Hot 11. It comes in a plastic body (typical of budget smartphones) and features a triple rear camera setup which includes a 13-megapixel main sensor, 2-megapixel sensor, and a QVGA AI sensor. You also get an 8-megapixel water drop selfie camera. You also get 3G of RAM (expandable UP to 6GB) and 64GB of internal storage. Furthermore, this device is powered by a 5000mAh battery, with no support for fast charging.
 
This smartphone comes in two variants (2GB/68GB and 3GB/68GB). The 2GB/68GB variant is available for a recommended retail price of 61,800 Naira ($149), while the 3GB/68GB will be selling for 67,000 Naira ($161). Infinix says the Hot 12i is available in partner stores (Jumia, Pointek, Konga, etc.) across the nation.
