However, sometimes, connecting it to your computer can be a challenging task, especially when you receive the “Windows cannot connect to the printer” error message. This issue is often frustrating and can significantly disrupt your workflow. If you’ve experienced problems connecting your printer, don’t worry. In this article, we’ll discuss some game-changing solutions to get your printer up and running.\nCheck your Network Connection The first thing you should do is check your network connection. Ensure that your computer and printer are connected to the same network. A weak or broken internet connection can cause printer connectivity issues. Try to reboot your router, modem, and printer if necessary.\nCheck Your Printer Connection Ensure that your printer is correctly plugged in and turned on. Check if it is connected to your computer via a USB cable or connected to the Wi-Fi network. Ensure that all cables are working correctly and securely connected to both the printer and computer.\nCheck Print Spooler Service Windows uses Print Spooler service to manage print jobs. Ensure that the Print Spooler service is running on your computer. To do this, press the Windows Key + R and type “services.msc” and press Enter. Locate the “Print Spooler” section, right-click, and select the “Start” option if it isn’t running.\nCreate a New Local Port Often, creating a new local port can resolve connectivity problems. To do this, head to the Printer settings and click on “Add a Printer.” Now, select “Add a Local Printer” and create a new port. Type the printer’s IP address and click “Next.” Windows will then locate your printer and install it.\nCheck Firewall and Antivirus Settings If your Firewall or Antivirus settings are too strict, they may block printer connectivity. Ensure that your printer’s IP address is allowed through your Firewall and Antivirus settings. Simply add the IP address to the exceptions list to allow it to run smoothly.\nReinstall Printer Drivers Another key cause of printer connectivity problems can be outdated or wrong Printer drivers. Check if the printer driver you installed is compatible with your Operating System. Uninstall the printer driver and then reinstall the latest version that’s compatible with your system.\nManually Install your Printer If all else fails, try to manually install your printer. To do this, go to the control panel and select “Devices and Printers.” Disconnect the printer from your computer, then click on “Add a Printer.” Now, choose the “Add a local or network printer with manual settings.” Select your printer model, add an IP address, and complete the installation process.\nConclusion\nGetting the “Windows Cannot Connect to Printer” message may be frustrating, but these 7 game-changing solutions can resolve the error message and get your printer up and running. Remember to check your network connection, printer connection, Print Spooler service, firewall, Antivirus settings, reinstall printer drivers, and manually install your printer. With these solutions, you can resume printing and avoid troubleshooting problems in the future.\nWhen your Microsoft Windows PC fails to connect to your printer, you get an error message: ”Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer.” You can’t print your documents or perform printer-related tasks when this happens.\nSome common reasons you get this error is that your printer is turned off, you don’t have the correct printer drivers installed, or your PC has a minor glitch. Once you fix these issues, your PC successfully connects to your printer, allowing you to print your documents.\n1. Turn On Your Printer One commonly overlooked reason your PC can’t make a connection with your printer is that your printer is turned off. Check that the printer is plugged in and turned on, and if you’re using a power strip, make sure that’s turned on, too.\n2. Use the Windows 10/11 Printer Troubleshooter Windows includes many troubleshooters to help you find and fix problems. One is a printer troubleshooter that helps identify and resolve any printer-related issues.\nThis troubleshooter detects and resolves most issues on its own, requiring minimal interaction from you.\nOpen Settings by pressing Windows + I at the same time. Select Update \u0026 Security in Settings. Choose Troubleshoot in the sidebar on the left. Select Additional troubleshooters on the right.Select Printer and choose Run the troubleshooter.Wait for the troubleshooter to find and fix your printer issues. 3. Restart the Print Spooler Service Windows’ print spooler service stores your print jobs until your printer is ready to print them. It’s worth stopping and restarting this service when you experience issues like ”Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer.”\nIt only takes a minute to turn this service off and back on.\nLaunch Run by pressing Windows + R at the same time. Type the following in the Run box and press Enter: services.msc Double-click Print Spooler on the right to open the Properties menu.Select Stop to temporarily stop the spooler service.Wait for about ten seconds. Reactivate the service by selecting Start. 4. Update Your Printer’s Drivers When you install a printer on your PC, Windows installs the required drivers to allow your printer to communicate with your machine. Over time, these drivers become outdated and cause various issues with your printer.\nYour ”Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer” error may result from outdated printer drivers. In this case, you can fix the issue by updating the installed drivers. Windows’ Device Manager automates the process, so you don’t have to find and install the latest drivers manually.\nOpen Device Manager by right-clicking the Start menu icon and choosing Device Manager. Expand the Print queues section, right-click your printer, and choose Update driver.Select Search automatically for drivers to let Windows find the latest printer drivers.Wait for Windows to find and install the updated drivers. If newer drivers aren’t available, you’ll see a message saying the best drivers for your device are already installed. In this case, you can still force your system to check for the latest drivers by selecting Search for updated drivers on Windows Update. 5. Remove and Reinstall Your Printer If you continue to see the ”Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer” error message, your printer may not be properly installed on your PC. This usually happens if you had minor issues when you installed the printer.\nYou can get around this printer error by removing and reinstalling the printer.\nAccess Settings by pressing Windows + I at the same time. Select Devices on the Settings window. Choose Printers \u0026 scanners from the sidebar on the left. Select your printer name on the right pane and choose Remove device.Select Yes in the prompt to uninstall your printer.Unplug and replug your printer into your PC. Follow your printer’s driver installation wizard. 6. Make Your Problematic Printer the Default Printer If you’ve installed multiple printers on your PC, make your faulty printer the default and see if that fixes the ”Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer” issue.\nLater, you can make any other printer the default if you want.\nOpen Settings by pressing Windows + I. Select Devices. Choose Printers \u0026 scanners on the left. Disable the Let Windows manage my default printer option on the right.Select your printer on the list and choose Manage. Select Set as default to set the selected printer as the default. 7. Fix Windows Issues by Installing Software Updates When you update your Windows PC, you get various bug fixes that help you resolve problems on your computer. Your ”Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer” error may be a system error, and updating Windows should likely fix that for you.\nIt’s free and easy to install Windows updates, as explained below.\nLaunch Settings by right-clicking the Start button and choosing Settings. Select Update \u0026 Security. Choose Windows Update in the sidebar on the left. Select Check for updates in the pane on the right.Download and install the latest updates. Restart your PC when you’ve installed the updates. The ”Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer” error is usually the result of a technical glitch, which you can fix by following the methods outlined above. Once you’ve applied those fixes, your printer should work with your PC, allowing you to resume your pending print jobs.\n","wordCount":"1389","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marcus Gregory"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/7-ways-to-fix-windows-cannot-connect-to-the-printer-732022/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Don't Let a Printer Problem Keep You Down: Learn These 7 Game-Changing Solutions for 'Windows Cannot Connect to the Printer'</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 4, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1389 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Marcus Gregory</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-turn-on-your-printer>1.
