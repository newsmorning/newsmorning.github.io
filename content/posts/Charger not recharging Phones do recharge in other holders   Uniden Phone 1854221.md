## Chosen Solution
 `Power Max 5.8  Model CLX 475-3
Their is a reading of 9.7 volts at the white wire going into back side of wall unit.   Read out on phone is check AC connection removed plug and reinstalled. Still no charging.
Thanks Wayne

 Hi,
Have you measured the voltage across the base unit  phone charging contacts at all? (i.e where the phone sits into the base unit)
There should be a set of pin connectors that the phone makes contact with so that it can be charged. They may be slightly hidden. Check the bottom of the phone to see how the pins would make contact.
If you cannot read at least a  3.8-4.4V DC voltage reading there then there is a problem between the DC-IN connector and the connecting pins in the base unit, possibly on a powerboard of some description. I have never opened one of these, but since there is 9V DC in and the phone only has 3.6V rechargeable batteries, then the 9V DC input must be the supply necessary to run the other functions in the base unit and approximately 4V DC is tapped off to charge the phone.
If you get a voltage reading, i.e. around 4V DC then the pins may have to be bent slightly inwards (I think) so that they place some tension on the connectors when the phone it set on them. Also check that they are bright and shiny so that there will be a good electrical connection.
