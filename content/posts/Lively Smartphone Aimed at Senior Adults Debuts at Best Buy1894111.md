Best Buy introduced a new smartphone on Thursday explicitly aimed at senior adult users. 

 

The device, called Lively Smart, is a simple smartphone with a large screen at 6.2 inches and a simple menu organized into an easy-to-read list. Among the regular features you’d find on a smartphone—such as calls and texts, a camera, and directions—the Lively Smart has access to Lively Health and Safety Services such as Urgent Response and Urgent Care that can connect users to trained Agents or registered nurses in one tap. 

 

Other features include a battery that lasts up to a full day, voice typing capabilities, brain games, and how-to guides to help users learn their new phone. Lively Smart costs $149.99 for the device plus monthly plans that range in price from $19.99 to $34.99. 

 

"Lively Smart expands our lineup of innovative phones and personal emergency response systems (PERS) that are tailored to the active aging population—a key demographic for Best Buy Health," said David Inns, Best Buy Health’s president of active aging, in the company’s announcement. 

 

"With Lively Smart, we’re continuing to innovate and create products that meet the needs of our customers and help them live independently at home."

 

Lively Smart joins the wide range of Lively products created for the aging community to keep them connected with technology, but in a simpler way than your average smartphone. 

 

Other products include the Lively Flip phone, the Lively Mobile + medical alert device, and the Lively Wearable2 that acts as a fall detection monitor but looks like a smartwatch.
