Transsion seems to be on a roll as we keep getting new devices. Over the past month or so, we’ve seen the Infinix Hot 10S, Tecno Camon 17, Tecno Spark 7P, just to mention but a few.
 
Keeping with the same pace (and confusing consumers even more), today Infinix Kenya is introducing yet another device in the Infinix Hot 10 line in form of the Infinix Hot 10T. 
 
Spec-wise, the Infinix Hot 10T is almost like a mirror image of its cousin, the  Tecno Spark 7P we highlighted earlier. The fact that the two devices have also been released days apart also goes to insinuate that these two are built from the same parts bin.
 
Below are the device’s specs
 
The Hot 10T is powered by the same Mediatek Helio G70 chipset that we saw in the Tecno Spark 7P. This is coupled with the Mali-G52 2EEMC2 that, while not the top of the line GPU, it more than holds its own.
 
Content consumption is taken care of courtesy of a 6.82-inch, 720×1640 display that, like the Camon 17 and the Tecno Spark 7P, has a 90Hz refresh rate.
 
On the software side of things, the Infinix Hot 10T comes with Android 11-based XOS 7.6 out of the box which is just as ad-ridden as previous skins. 
 
Add a 5,000mAh battery and you have a recipe for an all day device, just the way we like it. You also get a 8MP selfie shooter and a 48MP main sensor, a 2MP and a third sensor that Infinix calls an AI sensor.
 
## Availability of Infinix Hot 10T in Kenya
 
Now, the Infinix Hot 10T is available in the country starting today, May 5th, and is available across various accredited stores in the country. The 64GB model should run you a rather reasonable Ksh 15,500 while the top tier 128 GB goes for around Ksh 17,500. 
 
Here’s a PDF with a list of all accredited stores.
