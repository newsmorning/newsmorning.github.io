# Understanding The Error

The "bootmgr missing and no bios" error message is one that pops up on your screen when there is no operating system to boot from. This issue can occur due to various reasons such as corrupt or missing boot files, a faulty hard drive, or a damaged motherboard.

The BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is essential in starting your computer. It is responsible for functions such as controlling hardware settings, managing power settings, and allowing boot configuration. A malfunctioning BIOS can lead to the "bootmgr missing and no bios" error.

# Causes of Error

One of the most common causes of the "bootmgr missing and no bios" error is a corrupt or missing boot file. This critical system file is what allows your computer to boot up, and if it is missing or corrupted, then your computer won't be able to start up.

Another reason for the error could be due to a faulty hard drive. Hard drives are known to fail, and if your computer's hard drive is damaged, you may see this error message.

Lastly, a damaged motherboard could also lead to the "bootmgr missing and no bios" error. The motherboard is one of the most critical components of your laptop, and if it is damaged, it could prevent your computer from starting up correctly.

# How To Fix The Error

Now that we have discussed the causes of the "bootmgr missing and no bios" error let's move onto how to fix it. Here are a few things that you can try:

1. Repair your computer using Windows installation media: You can use your Windows installation media to repair your computer. If you do not have one, you can create a bootable USB drive using the Windows Media Creation Tool.

2. Check your hard drive for errors: Use the CHKDSK command in the Command Prompt to scan your hard drive for errors. This command checks the file system and the file system metadata of the drive.

3. Check your BIOS settings: Incorrect BIOS settings can cause the "bootmgr missing and no bios" error. Ensure that your BIOS settings are correctly configured.

4. Replace your hard drive: If your computer's hard drive is damaged, you may need to replace it. This can be a costly fix, but it is essential if you want to get your computer working correctly again.

 "hey. my Acer Aspire V5 431 cant boot up.. i think tis disk has been fully clean.. and i cant even use my win7 installation DVD to boot up.. it always display, "BOOTMGR missing""

 Hello mastermindmi7
Press F2 when power on the notebook and you will see BIOS
Change the Boot order as 1st : Optical Drive 2: HDD
restart the notebook with OS DVD
you can install new OS or if you having recovery option you can recover the notebook back

 I have done that and all I get is a flashing cursor.
