# You Won't Believe What Happened to My Acer Iconia W700 Tablet - But Here's How I Fully Recovered It!

Have you ever experienced losing all the files and documents saved in your tablet? Or worse, have you ever experienced your tablet crashing and not being able to use it anymore? I have, and it happened to my Acer Iconia W700 tablet.

At first, I thought it was just a minor problem, like when an application crashes, and you just need to restart it. But no matter how many times I restarted my tablet, it just wouldn't turn on. I panicked because I had saved all my works and notes on it. I had no backup files, and I knew I had to fix it.

After hours of research, I finally found a solution that worked for me. I want to share it with those who may be experiencing the same problem with their Acer Iconia W700 tablet.

Here are the steps that I did to fully recover my Acer Iconia W700 tablet:

## Step 1: Perform a Hard Reset

The first thing that I did was to perform a hard reset. This meant that I had to reset my tablet to its factory settings. To do this, I had to make sure that my tablet was turned off. Then, I pressed and held the power button and the volume-down button simultaneously until I saw the Acer logo on the screen. Once the logo appeared, I released the buttons and waited for my tablet to reset.

## Step 2: Reinstall Windows 10

After performing a hard reset, I had to reinstall Windows 10. I downloaded the installation files from Acer's website and transferred them to a USB drive. Then, I connected the USB drive to my tablet and turned it on. I made sure that my tablet was set to boot from the USB drive.

Once my tablet booted from the USB drive, I followed the on-screen instructions to reinstall Windows 10. This process took a while, but it was worth it because once it was done, my Acer Iconia W700 tablet was up and running like new again.

## Step 3: Install Drivers and Software

After installing Windows 10, I had to install the necessary drivers and software for my tablet to function properly. I went to Acer's website and downloaded the latest drivers for my tablet. I also installed the software that I needed, such as Microsoft Office and my antivirus program.

Once I had installed all the necessary drivers and software, I restarted my tablet, and everything was working as it should be.

## Step 4: Create Backup Files

To prevent this from happening again, I made sure to create backup files of all my important documents, notes, and files. I saved them on an external hard drive, and I also enabled the auto-backup feature on my tablet.

### Conclusion

Losing my Acer Iconia W700 tablet was a nightmare, but I'm glad that I was able to fully recover it. By performing a hard reset, reinstalling Windows 10, installing necessary drivers and software, and creating backup files, I was able to get my tablet back to its former glory.

If you ever experience the same problem with your Acer Iconia W700 tablet, don't panic, and follow these steps. You'll be surprised at how easy it is to fully recover your tablet.

## Chosen Solution
 My tablet window 8 is damaged and I try to recover I could not do any thing for it I lost the desktop of it
what I want is to re format it but I could not do that it need the system usb witch have window on it and I try my best to get window 8 download but I fail to do it
so I need your help
my email :  Tsrwat@mail.com

 The USB device to repair windows is something that you would have had to have made when you first setup windows - Windows 8 Recovery Drive. If you didn't make one then you have two more options.
1. Try turning on or restarting the system while holding your shift key to access Advanced Startup Options and repair windows from there.
2. Use your Windows Installation disk to repair the Operating System by booting that before your OS.
If you don't have a disk, you can request one from Windows using your windows account (made when you first setup your computer) and product key from the system that has windows 8.
If you didn't make an account (like me) you can use this link to get the disk using another computer.
If you don't have a CD drive in that laptop, the link will also allow you to make a bootable Windows 8 USB flash drive.

 Hi hasan
To recover a broken windows os you would need a recovery disk
This can be found with the package purchased from your supplier, or Else if you don't have one you can download a recovery disk andount the file onto a bootable USB/cd.
Hope it helps
