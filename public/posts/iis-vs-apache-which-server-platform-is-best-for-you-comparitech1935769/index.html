Two of the most popular server platforms are IIS (Internet Information Services) and Apache. Both of these platforms have their own strengths and weaknesses, but which one reigns supreme? In this article, we will examine the ultimate showdown between IIS and Apache, and find out which server platform comes out on top.\nRound 1: Performance\nWhen it comes to performance, both IIS and Apache have their own advantages. IIS is known for its faster processing of .NET code, while Apache is well-known for its scalability and ability to handle large volumes of traffic. Both server platforms are capable of providing excellent performance, but it ultimately comes down to your specific needs.\nWinner: Tie\nRound 2: Security\nIn the realm of security, IIS has a distinct advantage over Apache. IIS is known for its tight security features, and it is the only server platform to have received the highest level of certification for security from the National Security Agency (NSA). Apache, on the other hand, has had several security vulnerabilities in the past, which have led to several high-profile hacking incidents.\nWinner: IIS\nRound 3: Flexibility\nWhen it comes to flexibility, Apache takes the lead. Apache is an open-source platform, which means that it has a vast community of developers constantly working on new features and updates. This makes it easy to customize and modify Apache to suit your specific needs. IIS, on the other hand, is a closed platform, which means that it is more difficult to customize and modify.\nWinner: Apache\nRound 4: Compatibility\nBoth IIS and Apache are compatible with a wide variety of operating systems and programming languages. However, IIS is known for its better compatibility with Microsoft products, while Apache is known for its compatibility with Linux and Unix systems.\nWinner: Tie\nRound 5: Support\nWhen it comes to support, IIS has the advantage. Since IIS is a Microsoft product, it comes with complete support from Microsoft, which includes extensive documentation, community support, and dedicated customer service. Apache, on the other hand, relies mainly on community support, which can sometimes be limited.\nWinner: IIS\nConclusion\nAfter examining the ultimate showdown between IIS and Apache, it is clear that both server platforms have their own strengths and weaknesses. However, if we had to choose a winner, it would be IIS. While Apache has its advantages, IIS is the more secure and reliable option, particularly for businesses that need to run critical applications. Ultimately, the choice between IIS and Apache comes down to the specific needs of your business or website.\nWeb server software takes a lot of the work out of running your own Web sites. There are a number of Web application support options out on the market, but Internet Information Services and Apache HTTP Server lead the pack. According to Netcraft, IIS is the market leader in terms of the market share of all sites. In that league, IIS has 40.65% of the market, while Apache has 20.28%.\nIn terms of market share of domains, Apache is the leader with 33.99% of the market while IIS has 26.36%. So, both of these options are very widely implemented. By comparison, Google’s Web server software is only installed on 1.39% of all sites.\nIf you are kitting out a new server for your website, you are probably wondering which of these two systems to go for. In this guide, we will take a look at each option and explain the benefits of IIS and Apache. Armed with this knowledge, you will be in a better position to select both hardware and software to get your Web server operating.\nInternet Information Services (IIS) The software is backed by Microsoft and is frequently patched and updated to close off new hacker exploits. The security features of IIS have made it a safer option than Apache. As a commercial product, IIS competes in the marketplace with new developments that meet the needs of marketers. The tool is geared towards sales, which means it isn’t free to use. However, there is a limited free version, called IIS Express. The standard version of IIS is bundled in with Windows Server.\nA huge advantage of IIS is that it integrates with other Microsoft offerings, specifically .NET and the ASPX scripting language. Also, the management console is very slick and includes in-depth performance and analysis reports. In short, the choice of a Web server produced by a major software provider gets you a solid guarantee of cutting-edge security patches and an expectation of marketing-led features.\nThe biggest detraction of IIS is that it is proprietary and not free to use. Another major factor that may make you decide not to opt for IIS is that it only works on Windows environments. If you have already bought a Linux server, then you just can’t use IIS.\nApache HTTP Server The development of Apache is all performed by enthusiast volunteers. You don’t get access to a help desk for assistance if you face problems getting any part of the HTTP Server to work. However, there is an extensive user and enthusiast community on the Web and this channel provides a constant stream of tips and updated warnings on how to get the best out of the Server system. The open-source management of this option means you can comb through the code yourself and even adapt the software to produce your own customized implementation.\nApache isn’t restricted to one operating system. However, it is better suited to the Linux environment. So much so that it has become part of a bundle of Web services solutions that are known as LAMP. This acronym stands for Linux for the operating system, Apache for the Web server, MySQL for the database management system, and PHP for scripting. This is regarded as the “out of the box” Web server solution and was the industry leader for a very long time. IIS has only recently overtaken Apache as the leading Web server system. You aren’t limited to PHP for scripting with Apache HTTP Server because it also supports Perl and Python.\nThe core Apache can be extended to add on Transport Layer Security and cover HTTPS. Another add-on will give you FTP delivery capabilities.\nRelated Post: Best Apache Monitoring Tools\nMaking a choice If your website is media-rich, you would probably be better off opting for IIS. The server integrates with other Microsoft products and has better methods of dealing with audio and video playback. Another reason that IIS would be better for media sites is that it uses a lot less processing resources for each connection and media file transmission can use up a lot of processing time.\nFor portability, you would be better off with Apache HTTP Server. If you expect to trade in your server hardware any time soon, the operating system independence of Apache extends your purchasing options. Apache HTTP Server can operate on Windows as well as Linux.\nThe reason that these two systems have very close market share is that there is very little difference between the two in terms of vulnerabilities and performance. There are many test results available on the Web that show that either one or the other has better response times. However, the results are usually very close and the winner in those tests usually turns out to be the system that the tester favored from the very beginning.\nThe Web developer community is very clearly divided along the lines of Apache and IIS because programmers become adept in one language and one environment and employers don’t encourage them to cross over. So, your choice of Web server may lock you into one skills pool.\nThe biggest influence on your choice between these two systems will be your existing hardware and software resources. If you are a startup with no premises or equipment right now, you are free to choose either of these systems. If you already have equipment that runs Linux, you are more likely to opt for Apache HTTP Server. Although Apache can run on Windows, if you already have your business based on Microsoft products, you already have onsite skills that are more compatible with IIS than Apache.\nGetting your business online If you don’t already have onsite resources, then you are open to the option of Cloud-based Web servers. A big advantage of these services is that they will include the server software. So then your decision making will be based on pricing structures, scalability, and other services bundled in with the Web server.\nDecision making is a difficult task and the fact that there is little differentiation in performance between IIS and Apache actually makes the choice even harder. However, there is an upside to this similarity. Both of these systems are well-established and widely-used. Therefore, there is little risk that whichever of these two you use that you would have made the “wrong” choice.\nIIS is a proprietary system owned by Microsoft, while Apache HTTP Server is an open source system. The big influence that this difference has on the two Web server systems is that Microsoft integrates its Web server into the Windows operating system and it is already a part of Windows Server. Apache HTTP Server was designed to run in Unix and Unix-like systems, which includes macOS and Linux. However, it is also available for Windows. Both systems are free to use.\n","wordCount":"1604","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jerry Brown"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/iis-vs-apache-which-server-platform-is-best-for-you-comparitech1935769/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Shocking Truth Revealed: The Ultimate Showdown Between Iis and Apache - Find Out Which Server Platform Reigns Supreme!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 4, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1604 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jerry Brown</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#internet-information-services-iis>Internet Information Services (IIS)</a></li><li><a href=#apache-http-server>Apache HTTP Server</a></li><li><a href=#making-a-choice>Making a choice</a></li><li><a href=#getting-your-business-online>Getting your business online</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Article Title: Shocking Truth Revealed: The Ultimate Showdown Between Iis and Apache - Find Out Which Server Platform Reigns Supreme!</p><p>Introduction</p><p>In the world of web development, choosing the right server platform can make a significant impact on the performance and stability of your website.
