## Chosen Solution
 The right chanel in the PC speaker dont't work. If I connect to external speaker it's ok, so the problema is in the hardware. It's a production problema because other ACER's I tested have the same problem.

 I have read a lot about those Aspires with only one speaker.
I opened mine and had an extra connection for another speaker on the main-board but no speaker present.
Open yours, hope it has the connector and find some other speaker that fits the space you have there and fix your sound.

 Yes. You are right. I have the same computer which doesn't give the sound from two speaker. When i bought it, i realised that there is no sound from one of them. First i think it is broken but i understood from your writing that it is manufacturing problem or they did it on purpose. Thank you.
