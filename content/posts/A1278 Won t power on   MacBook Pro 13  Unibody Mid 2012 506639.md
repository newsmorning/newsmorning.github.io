Is Your MacBook Pro Dead? Learn How to Revive Your A1278 Unibody Mid 2012 with These Simple Steps!

MacBook Pro is one of the most popular laptops in the world. If you own an A1278 Unibody Mid 2012, you are one of the lucky ones. However, even the best laptops can fail at times, and there are chances that you may start to experience problems with your MacBook Pro. If that happens, don't panic. You can revive your MacBook Pro by following these simple steps.

1. Check the Battery

The first thing you need to do is check your MacBook Pro's battery. Make sure it's charged and connected properly. If the battery is dead, try to power it up using the power adapter. If it still doesn't turn on, leave the MacBook Pro to charge for a while and then try to turn it on again.

2. Reset the SMC

The System Management Controller (SMC) is responsible for controlling the hardware components in your MacBook Pro. If your MacBook Pro is unresponsive, resetting the SMC may help fix the problem. Follow these steps to reset the SMC on your MacBook Pro:

- Shut down your MacBook Pro
- Unplug the power adapter
- Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds
- Release the power button
- Plug in the power adapter and turn on your MacBook Pro

3. Reset the PRAM/NVRAM

The Parameter Random Access Memory (PRAM) and Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM) store the settings of your MacBook Pro, such as volume level and display resolution. If your MacBook Pro is not starting up or showing any signs of life, resetting the PRAM/NVRAM may help. Here's how to do it:

- Shut down your MacBook Pro
- Press the power button and immediately hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys
- Keep holding the keys until you hear the startup sound twice
- Release the keys and wait for your MacBook Pro to start up

4. Boot in Safe Mode

If your MacBook Pro is not starting up properly, try booting it in Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode that disables certain features and files that may cause problems during startup. Follow these steps to boot your MacBook Pro in Safe Mode:

- Shut down your MacBook Pro
- Press the power button and immediately hold down the Shift key
- Keep holding the Shift key until you see the Apple logo
- Release the Shift key and wait for your MacBook Pro to start up

5. Reinstall macOS

If none of the above steps work, you may need to reinstall macOS on your MacBook Pro. Before you do that, make sure you have backed up your data. Here's how to reinstall macOS:

- Shut down your MacBook Pro
- Press the power button and immediately hold down the Command and R keys
- Keep holding the keys until you see the Apple logo or a spinning globe
- Release the keys and wait for your MacBook Pro to start up in Recovery mode
- Select "Reinstall macOS" and follow the on-screen instructions

In conclusion, if your MacBook Pro is dead, don't lose hope. There are several things you can do to revive it. Check the battery, reset the SMC, reset the PRAM/NVRAM, boot in Safe Mode, or reinstall macOS. These simple steps may help you get your MacBook Pro up and running again.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi all
I have a MacBook Pro, Mid 2012, A1278 (EMC 2554).  It wont turn on from the power button.  Plugging the power cable in powers it up due to the Auto Power On feature.  I’m also unable to turn the device off by pressing and holding the button either.
The behavior makes me think the Button is at fault, however, unplugging the battery and removing the power adaptor and unplugging the keyboard then shorting the Power Pads on the motherboard also doesn’t turn the device on, This process apparently bypasses the button. Does anyone have any idea what I could try next?
I’m not afraid to go digging with a multi meter and I have a schematic and board view and confident with a soldering iron/hot air station.
Board number is  820-3115-B
Update (08/17/2021)
Yes the HDD is backed up
The MagSafe was originally orange, but once the battery was charged it turned green.
I have checked all of the following Power Rails and they are present and correct:
PP3v42PPBUS_G3HPP5VS5PP5VS3PPVRTC_G3H
When I short Pin 5 of the Keyboard connector to ground it still doesn’t turn on which is basically what the switch does.

 Ouch! This is starting to look like a dead CPU or GPU issue.
Let’s give this a try, Disconnect the battery and with another plugged in on the external ports press and hold the power button for a good 15 sec. Now carefully plug in the MagSafe charger did the fan try to start, did the system startup at all?
