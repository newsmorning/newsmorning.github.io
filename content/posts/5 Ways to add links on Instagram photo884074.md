With Instagram's latest updates, users can now add clickable links to their photos, making it easier to direct their followers to specific pages or products. In this article, we’ll teach you how to add links to your Instagram photos and revolutionize your social media game in just 5 minutes!

## Step-by-Step Guide To Adding Links To Your Instagram Photos

### Step One: Take A Photo or Choose An Existing One

The first step is to either take a photo or choose an existing photo that you want to post on Instagram. This photo can be a product shot, a lifestyle image, or anything that you want to share with your followers.

### Step Two: Edit Your Photo

Once you've selected the photo, edit it according to your preferences. You can add filters, adjust the brightness and contrast, and do anything else that you want to make your photo stand out.

### Step Three: Tap The Link Icon

After editing your photo, tap the link icon located at the bottom-left corner of your screen. This icon is denoted by an infinity symbol with an arrow pointing upwards.

### Step Four: Add Your Link

Once you tap on the link icon, you will be directed to a new screen where you can add your link. You can add a link to a specific webpage, your blog, your online shop, or any other webpage that you want to direct your followers to.

### Step Five: Post Your Photo

Once you've added your link, hit the "Share" button to post your photo. Your followers will be able to click on the link in your photo, which will take them directly to the webpage that you added.

## Tips For Adding Links To Your Instagram Photos

Here are some useful tips to consider when adding links to your Instagram photos:

* Be strategic: Only add links to photos that are relevant to your brand or your followers. Don't spam your followers with links that are irrelevant or uninteresting.

* Use a call-to-action: Encourage your followers to click on the link by adding a call-to-action in your caption. For example, "Click the link in our bio to shop our new collection!"

* Use Linktree: If you have multiple links that you want to share with your followers, use Linktree to create one clickable link that directs followers to a page where they can see all of your links.

## Final Thoughts

By following these simple steps, you can easily add links to your Instagram photos and make it easier for your followers to connect with your brand. Remember to be strategic with your use of links and always be mindful of what your followers are interested in. With a little practice, you'll be a pro at adding links to your Instagram photos and revolutionizing your social media game!

However, after showing off your organization’s content, how do you convert your profile visitors to website visitors, buyers, or leads?
 
You have to learn how to put links in your Instagram photos and videos. Read this article to the end, as we’ll show you five ways to do this free of charge.
 
## How do I put links on Instagram photos?
 
### 1. Add the link to your bio
 

 
The first place your profile visitors look is your bio. It is visible to everyone, even if your Instagram account is private. You can see the bio link as a base link where users should click to learn more about you or your organization.
 
Some users use links to their most recent content, hence change their bio links frequently. Others prefer to link to a specific page on their website or app and leave it at that.
 
There are benefits and disadvantages of both link strategies; hence, your choice depends on what outcome you desire.
 
If you want both, you can use a link service. They create a link for you to put in your bio, and clickers are directed to a page with various relevant links on your website.
 
Link services give you customization options to let the linked page match your brand design.
 
### 2. Insert the link in your Instagram stories
 
Instagram shows your timeline posts to only a fraction of your followers. Whereas, the application delivers your stories to every one of your followers.
 
For this strategy to work, your story has to catch your followers’ interest. It should also include a clear call-to-action that instructs viewers to swipe up.
 
Stories on Instagram last for a max of 15 seconds and disappear after 24 hours, so you have only a small window to make an impression.
 
Alternatively, you can also pin your IG stories with evergreen links to the highlights of your profile permanently.
 
To insert links in your Instagram stories, you must have at least 10,000 followers or a verified account. When done correctly, IG story links can be massively beneficial to B2C brands.
 
### 3. Use short links in post captions
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.

Expert tip:

Links you insert in your captions are not clickable, and that’s why brands look for other ways to link to their website or app.
 
However, your timeline posts and their captions are still some of the most viewed content on your account.
 
Note that this strategy needs your followers to type the link into their browsers manually.
 
Therefore, pasting your content link in your image or video captions is effective only when the link is either short or memorable. If your link is long, you can use a link shortener.
 
### 4. Use Instagram Shoppable stories and posts
 
Thanks to Instagram Shoppable posts, you can now embed links on your posts directly. If you’re not sure what Shoppable posts are, look out for posts with a shopping bag icon.
 
On tapping posts with this icon, you see a little popup saying Tap to view products. When you tap this message, it redirects you to the linked page or product.
 
You can add multiple product links to a single post. On the part of your customers, they’ll have a smooth transition from your post to the linked product.
 
Hence, with engaged audiences, this is a highly effective linking method.
 
### 5. Link using IG ads
 
While users search for how to put links in Instagram photos, Instagram already has a solution for this through. If you’ve used Facebook ads or other advertising services, you can use Instagram ads.
 
When you pay Instagram and publish an ad, you get to put your link directly below the photo you promote.
 
For this, your link has to be relevant to the promoted content. Instagram also lets you customize the button to match your design and the content.
 
If you have video content, IGTV allows you to insert clickable links directly in the video description. You’ve now learned how to put links in Instagram photos and videos. Is there any other method you use? Do let us know in the comments below.
