The brake lights are something that frequently needs replacing compared to other parts and it is important to make sure your brake lights are functioning properly. It will become dangerous to drive around in a car with no brake lights.
 
There are many other light bulbs to be used as brake lights available, but the one I recommend is the Sylvia 2357 long life mini bulb.
