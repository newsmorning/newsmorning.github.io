Revolutionize Your Data Analysis with Decision Trees: Everything You Need to Know, Plus a Head-to-Head Comparison with Random Forests!

Data analysis is a crucial aspect of modern-day businesses. With advancements in technology and the increasing amount of data that organizations collect, traditional methods of data analysis are no longer adequate. Decision trees and random forests are two popular techniques used in data analysis that have revolutionized the way organizations make sense of their data.

In this article, we will discuss decision trees and their importance in data analysis. We will also compare decision trees with random forests to help you choose the best technique for your specific needs.

What Are Decision Trees?

Decision trees are a hierarchical structure of choices and consequences that can be used to represent a set of decisions and their possible outcomes. They are used to solve classification and regression problems in machine learning.

Decision trees have the following characteristics:

- Each internal node represents a decision.
- Each branch represents an outcome of that decision.
- The leaves represent the final outcomes.

Decision trees are easy to interpret, and their graphical representation makes them useful for quick analysis. In addition, decision trees do not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data or the relationships between the variables.

How Does a Decision Tree Work?

Decision trees work by iteratively splitting the data based on the most informative feature. The feature with the highest information gain is chosen as the decision that splits the data into two subsets. The process continues until the leaves contain data samples from a single class, in the case of classification, or a single value, in the case of regression.

Decision trees are built using one of several algorithms such as ID3, CART, and C4.5. These algorithms calculate the information gain, which is a measure of how well a decision splits the data based on the target variable. The algorithm iterates over all features and chooses the feature that maximizes the information gain.

What Are Random Forests?

Random forests are an ensemble of decision trees. They are used to improve the accuracy and stability of predictions by combining the results of multiple decision trees. Random forests have become very popular due to their high accuracy and robustness to noise and overfitting.

Random forests have the following characteristics:

- They are made up of an ensemble of decision trees.
- Each tree is built using a random subset of features and data samples.
- The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all the decision trees.

How Does a Random Forest Work?

Random forests work by building multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data and features. Each tree is built using a random subset of features and data samples from the training data. The algorithm then averages the predictions of all the decision trees to arrive at the final prediction.

Random forests also have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance. These hyperparameters include the number of decision trees, the maximum depth of each tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.

Decision Trees vs. Random Forests: Which Is Better?

Both decision trees and random forests have their strengths and weaknesses. Decision trees are easy to interpret and require very little computation time, making them ideal for small datasets. However, decision trees tend to overfit the data, resulting in poor performance on unseen data.

Random forests, on the other hand, are more accurate and robust than decision trees. They are less prone to overfitting and can handle large datasets with high-dimensional features. However, random forests are computationally expensive and require more tuning of hyperparameters.

In conclusion, decision trees and random forests are powerful techniques for data analysis. Decision trees are easy to interpret and computationally fast, making them ideal for small datasets. Random forests are more accurate and robust but require more computation time and tuning of hyperparameters. Therefore, you should choose the technique that best suits your specific needs.

## What Is A Decision Tree? 
 
A decision tree is a flowchart in the shape of a tree structure used to depict the possible outcomes for a given input. The tree structure comprises a root node, branches, and internal and leaf nodes. An individual internal node represents a partitioning decision, and each leaf node represents a class prediction.

It is useful in building a training model that predicts the class or value of the target variable through simple decision-making rules. Given the information and options relevant to the decision, it aids businesses in determining which decision at any given choice point will produce the highest predicted financial return.
 

 
### 
Key Takeaways

 
- A decision tree is a directed flowchart drawn in a structure similar to a tree. The tree structure comprises root nodes, branches, internal nodes, and leaf nodes.The decision-making process is carried through branching out of nodes, which depicts various possibilities where the user decides to choose or discard an option. The results or concluding nodes are called a leaf.The structure enables decision-making by categorizing them as best or worstIt helps in concluding by allowing the interpretation of data visually

 
### Decision Tree Explained 
 
A decision tree is a classifier that helps in making decisions. It is depicted as a rooted tree filled with nodes with incoming edges. The one node without any incoming edge is known as the “root” node, and each of the other nodes has just one incoming edge. Similarly, a node with edges protruding out is an internal or test node. At the same time, the remaining nodes at the end are leaves, called terminal or decision nodes. In addition, each internal node in the structure divides the instance space into several sub-spaces by a particular discrete function of the values of the input attributes.
 
Each test takes into account a single attribute. Instance space then divides itself according to the attribute’s value. In cases involving numeric attributes, one can refer to it as a range. Each leaf receives a class that represents the ideal target value. In addition, the leaf may contain a probability vector displaying the possibility that the target property will have a specific value. According to the results of the tests along the path, one can categorize the instances. This is possible by moving them from the tree’s root to a leaf. In short, the stopping criteria and pruning technique directly control the tree’s complexity.
 
#### Structure
 
The structure contains the following:
 
- Root Node: The root node represents the entire population or sample. It then partitions into two or more homogenous sets.Splitting: The process of splitting involves separating a node into several sub-nodes.Decision Node: A sub-node becomes a decision node when it divides into more sub-nodes.Leaf or terminal nodes: Nodes that do not split are the leaf or terminal nodes.Pruning: Pruning is the process of removing sub-nodes from a decision node. One can describe it as splitting in reverse.Branch or Sub-Tree: A branch or sub-tree is a division of the overall tree.Parent and Child Node: A node split into subsidiary nodes is called the parent node. Sub-nodes are the offspring of a parent node

 
### Uses 
 
A decision tree is generally best suitable for problems with the following characteristics:
 
1. Instances represented by attribute-value pairs:
 
Instances possess fixed sets of attributes and their values. These trees aid decision-making with a limited number of possible disjoint values and allow the numerical representation of real-valued attributes such as level or degree.
 
2. Target functions possessing discrete output values:
 
It allows boolean (yes or no) classifications and functions with more than two possible output values and real-valued outputs.
 
3. Disjunctive descriptions: 
 
They are useful in representing disjunctive expressions.
 
4. Data with missing attribute values:
 
The method helps reach a decision even with missing or unknown values.
 
In real-world applications, they are useful in both business investment decisions and general individual decision-making processes. Decision trees are widely popular as predictive models while making observations. Additionally, decision tree learning is a supervised learning approach used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning.
 
### Examples 
 
Check out these examples to get a better idea:
 
#### Example #1
 
David considers investing a certain amount. Consequently, he considers three options: mutual funds, debt funds, and cryptocurrencies. He analyses them with one priority criterion- they must give a more than 60% return. Dave understands that the associated risk is also high, but the amount he is investing is extra money he is fine losing. Since only cryptocurrencies can give such returns, he opts for them. 
 
Check out the illustration of the decision-making process below. 
 
#### Example #2
 
Dave has $100,000 with him. He wants to spend it but is unsure how. He knows he wants a new car but also understands that it is a depreciating asset and its value tends to reduce over time. On the other hand, he has another option- investing in it. If he chooses that option, he could split them, put them in a Roth IRA (a special individual retirement account), and use the rest to purchase a house, which can earn him passive income through rent. He, therefore, chooses to invest.
 
### Advantages & Disadvantages 
 
Here are the main advantages and disadvantages of using a decision tree;
 
#### #1 Advantages
 
- It helps in the easy conclusion of decisions by allowing the interpretation of data visually.The structure can be used for a combination of numerical and non-numerical data.Decision tree classification enables decision-making by categorizing them according to the specification.

 
#### #2 Disadvantages
 
- If the tree structure becomes complex, one can interpret irrelevant data.Calculations in predictive analysis can easily become tedious, particularly when a decision route contains numerous chance variables.A minor change in the data can significantly impact the decision tree’s structure, expressing a different outcome than what is possible in a normal setting.

 
### Decision Tree vs Random Forest vs Logistic Regression 
 
- A decision tree is a structure in which each vertex-shaped formation is a question, and each edge descending from that vertex is a potential response to that question. Random Forest combines the output of various decision trees to produce a single outcome. Thus, it solves classification and regression issues; this method is simple and adaptable.Logistic regression calculates the probability of a particular event occurring based on a collection of independent variables and a given dataset. The dependent variable’s range is 0 to 1 in this method.

 
While all of them are concerned with arriving at a conclusion based on probability, all three are different.
