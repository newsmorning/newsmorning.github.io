 Hi,
Here’s a link to an Asus parts supplier for your laptop series.

If you click on the keyboard(52) checkbox you will find the part numbers for all the various country specific keyboards for the laptop.
If you search online using the part number only appropriate to your particular laptop, you should find suppliers of the keyboard.
Usually the part number is also printed on the underside of the keyboard if you wish to verify that you have the correct part number.
Hopefully this is of some help.
