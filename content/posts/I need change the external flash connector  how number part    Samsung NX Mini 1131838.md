Title: Secret Samsung NX Mini Hack: Learn How to Easily Upgrade Your External Flash Connector and Take Your Photography Game to the Next Level!

Are you tired of being limited by the built-in flash of your Samsung NX Mini? Do you want to take your photography to the next level with an external flash, but find that the external flash connector on your camera is not compatible with most external flashes? Fear not, for we have discovered a secret Samsung NX Mini hack that will solve your problem!

Here's how to easily upgrade your external flash connector and take your photography game to the next level:

Step 1: Get a TTL adapter

The Samsung NX Mini comes with a hot shoe mount that only works with Samsung's own SEF7A external flash. However, with a TTL adapter, you can convert the hot shoe mount to a standard hot shoe that is compatible with most external flashes. You can find TTL adapters online or at your local camera store.

Step 2: Connect the TTL adapter to the hot shoe mount

Attach the TTL adapter to the hot shoe mount on your Samsung NX Mini. Make sure that it is securely fastened in order to avoid any damage to your camera.

Step 3: Connect your external flash to the TTL adapter

Now that your hot shoe mount has been converted to a standard hot shoe, you can easily connect your external flash to your camera via the TTL adapter. Just make sure that your external flash is compatible with your camera and that you follow the manufacturer's instructions for attaching it to the adapter.

And there you have it! With this simple three-step process, you can upgrade your Samsung NX Mini's external flash connector and take your photography game to the next level. No longer will you be limited by the built-in flash of your camera - you can now explore the world of external flashes and unleash your creativity!

In conclusion, this secret Samsung NX Mini hack is a game-changer for those who want to take their photography to the next level. With the help of a TTL adapter, you can easily upgrade your external flash connector and gain access to a wider range of external flashes. So what are you waiting for? Give this hack a try and watch your photography skills soar!

 @framosnt you need to change it from what to what? I assume you are needing a Hot Shoe adapter for your camera.  Take a look at this type of adapter. Nope, iFixit does not sell items like this.
