The Zero 20 and the Note 12 are the latest Infinix phones that are set to revolutionize the way we use our smartphones.

The device comes powered by a MediaTek Helio G95 chipset and is backed by 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. You can expect snappy performance even while running multiple apps, playing intensive games, or editing videos on this device.\nThe Infinix Zero 20 doesn’t just excel in visual and performance aspects.

Both devices boast cutting-edge features that are sure to delight users who are looking for a premium smartphone experience. If you’re in the market for a new smartphone or phablet, these devices are worth checking out.\nIn a strategic effort to continuously reserve a seat at the table of top influential smartphone manufacturers, Infinix is continuously updating its portfolio. They just released their top-of-the-range Infinix Zero Ultra 5G featuring a 200MP camera and an ambitious 180W Thunder Charging. They also did not forget about the midrange-tier phone category. It is within this category that they will boast the Infinix Zero 20 and the Infinix Note 12 (2023) with pretty competitive specs. Both have just been announced as 2023 feature devices. So let us have a look at what each of them brings to the table.\nAlso Read: Infinix Zero Ultra 5G With 180W Thunder Charging: Here’s What We Know\nInfinix Zero 20: Features And Specs As you would expect, the Infinix Zero series will typically be superior to the Note series. And the Infinix Zero 20 is no exception. In terms of screen real estate, expect a 6.7-Inch AMOLED display with a dazzling 90 Hz of refresh rate. The SoC is the Helio G99 from MediaTek driving a nifty 1080p FHD+ display resolution. To stand out from the already crowded tier, the Infinix Zero 20 is the only 2022 phone to feature Optical Image Stabilisation(OIS) on a 60MP selfie camera.\nAt the back of the Infinix Zero 20, you will find a 108MP main camera, a 13MP wide-angle sensor, and a 2MP auxiliary sensor. Battery capacity and Fast Charging are the other important smartphone features that this new device keeps up with the competition. The Zero 20 comes with a 4500mAh battery coupled with 45W fast charging. This device comes with Android 12 out of the box but you will have to live with the Infinix XOS skin.\nThe colors available at the moment are Gold and Gray, that’s not a lot to choose from. The same applies to the RAM and Storage, there’s just the 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage configuration. For an Helio G99, some may find the Infinix Zero 20 overpriced at €460. There is no official retail price in Kenya but you can expect it to range between ksh45,000 and Ksh52,000 based on prices in other countries.\nAlso Read: Vivo Kenya hints at the Vivo V25 5G launch: Specs and Price In Kenya\nInfinix Note 12 (2023): Specs And Features As highlighted earlier, the Infinix Zero 20 is the more interesting and superior of the 2 devices we are discussing today. However, that does not condemn the Infinix Note 12 (2023) to be a terrible device, quite far from the truth. As you can already see, Infinix is now re-launching devices with a different “year-label”. Unlike the Infinix Zero 20, the Infinix Note 12 (2023) is not a new device per se. At it its simplest, the Infinix Note 12 (2023) is very similar to the Infinix Note 12 Pro with a few upgrades.\nFirst, they ditched the 108MP main shooter for a 50MP sensor. Secondly, the new device packs a single speaker as compared to the incumbent’s dual speaker setup. All other departments appear to remain unchanged. This means the SoC is an Helio G99 from MediaTek. At the back you will also find a 2MP auxiliary snapper then the front has a 16MP selfie shooter. The screen is still a 6.7″ AMOLED display. The battery is slightly larger than the Zero 20 at 5,000mAh.\nHowever, the charging capabilities have been turned down to 33W Fast Charging. This device also comes with Android 12 out of the box with the Infinix XOS skin attached to it. Available colors for this device are Grey, White, and Blue with a single 8GB RAM and 128GB storage setup. This Infinix Note 12 (2023) is currently retailing at Ksh 28,000 in Kenya.\nAlso Read: iPhone 14: Here’s Prices and Where to Buy the iPhone 14 devices in Kenya\nFeatured Image Courtesy: Phone Bunch\nRelated ","wordCount":"1250","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Roberta Eccleston"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-zero-20-and-infinix-note-12-2023-features-specs-prices-1393176/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionary Infinix Devices for 2023 Unveiled!
