Title: You Won't Believe How Improperly Installed Screws Can Make Your MacBook Pro Inoperable!

As a MacBook Pro user, you know how important it is to maintain your device in good condition. However, you may not have realized that even small mistakes during repairs or upgrades can cause significant hardware damage. One of those mistakes is improperly installed screws.

Yes, screws can be the cause of your MacBook Pro's failure! If screws are not tightened correctly, they can come loose and cause severe damage to the internal components of your machine. This may result in data loss or even rendering your MacBook Pro inoperable.

The screws in your MacBook Pro are crucial for holding various components in place, including the battery, motherboard, display, and keyboard. Tightening and securing these screws correctly is essential to keep all of these parts aligned and in place, and prevent the risk of damage that could render your MacBook Pro unusable.

Unfortunately, inexperienced repair technicians or DIYers may unintentionally cross-thread, strip, or over-tighten screws, leading to costly repairs and replacements. Moreover, using the wrong type or size of screws can damage the motherboard, which is one of the most expensive parts to replace in your MacBook Pro.

Furthermore, if the screws are not tightened correctly or are missing, your MacBook Pro may emit strange noises, or its fan may start to sound louder than usual, which signals that the internal parts are not aligned correctly.

So, what should you do to avoid such mistakes?

Firstly, make sure you seek professional help from authorized Apple technicians or service providers when you need repairs or upgrades for your MacBook Pro. Ask for their credentials, certifications, and expertise to be sure they know how to handle your MacBook Pro's complicated internal components.

Secondly, be cautious when working on your MacBook Pro yourself. Research and read the user manual or online tutorials carefully before proceeding, so that you don't make simple yet costly mistakes.

Thirdly, always use the correct screws, and do not over-tighten them. You can use screw organizers or magnetic screwdrivers to keep the screws in place and avoid confusion.

Your MacBook Pro is a valuable investment that needs care and attention to keep it running at its best. Do not ignore the importance of screws during repairs or upgrades, or you may end up paying more than you bargained for.

In conclusion, remember that screws play a vital role in keeping your MacBook Pro in excellent condition, and improper handling of them can cause severe damage. Therefore, it's crucial to follow the correct installation procedures and seek the help of professionals when unsure.

## Chosen Solution
 I have to use 2 hands, one to push the button, and a fingernail between display and lower case to get the computer open. I read that the wrong screw length caused this, but I cannot find it referenced in any repair manual.
Update (08/31/2017)
Thanks. the problem is that when you push the button, it doesn't spring open when resting horizontally. The upper hooks release when I push the button, but it won't open without assist by a fingernail or screwdriver. If I let go of the button, it re locks closed.  Are there springs that are supposed to propel it open?

 There are two latches in the top and the receptacles are in the bottom with the magnets. Carefully close the lid and see if they line up and see if the top latches are being pulled down. Gently push the top case in the direction it needs to go after observations. You can also inspect the hooks to see if they are broken or bent.
