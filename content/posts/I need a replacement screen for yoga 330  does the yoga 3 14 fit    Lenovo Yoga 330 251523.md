Attention Lenovo Yoga 330 Owners! Discover The Surprising Replacement Screen Hack You NEED To Know!

If you're one of the proud owners of the Lenovo Yoga 330, you might have noticed the need for a replacement screen at one point or another. But did you know that there's a simple, surprising hack you can use to replace your Lenovo Yoga 330 screen without having to spend a lot of money?

The Lenovo Yoga 330 is a popular choice for users who are looking for a versatile, lightweight device that can be used as both a laptop and a tablet. Its compact size and impressive performance has made it a go-to option for users who are always on the go.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest issues that users face with the Lenovo Yoga 330 is the cost of replacement parts, particularly the screen. Screens can be quite costly, and it's not always easy to find a replacement that fits your budget.

Thankfully, there is a surprising solution that will help you replace the screen of your Lenovo Yoga 330 at a much lower cost. Here's everything you need to know:

Step 1: Determine the size of your Lenovo Yoga 330 screen

The first thing you need to do is determine the size of your Lenovo Yoga 330 screen. This can be easily done by measuring the diagonal length of your screen with a tape measure.

Most Lenovo Yoga 330 models have a 13.3-inch screen, but it's always a good idea to double-check to ensure that you're getting the correct replacement screen size.

Step 2: Find a replacement screen for a Dell laptop with the same size

The next step is to search for a replacement screen. Here's where it gets interesting. Instead of looking for a screen specifically for the Lenovo Yoga 330, look for a screen that is meant for a Dell laptop with the same screen size.

This is because Dell laptop screens are often much cheaper than screens made specifically for Lenovo laptops. By using a Dell screen, you can significantly reduce the cost of your replacement screen.

Step 3: Install the new screen

Once you've received your replacement screen, it's time to install it. The good news is that replacing the screen on a Lenovo Yoga 330 is a relatively simple process that you can do yourself.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you out:

1. Turn off your Lenovo Yoga 330 and unplug it from the power source.

2. Remove the screws that hold the bezel in place around the edges of your screen.

3. Remove the old screen by disconnecting the cables from the back of the panel.

4. Connect the cables to the new screen.

5. Place the new screen in the frame and tighten the screws that hold the bezel in place.

6. Turn on your laptop to test the new screen.

Voila! You now have a brand new, working screen on your Lenovo Yoga 330 without having to spend a lot of money.

In conclusion, if you're an owner of the Lenovo Yoga 330 and need to replace the screen, don't let the high cost of replacement parts discourage you. By following this simple and surprising replacement screen hack, you can save a lot of money and enjoy a working laptop again.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a lenovo yoga 330, is this the same screen to replace a cracked screen? I can only see yoga 3 14 on your site. Thanks

 Hi @teresarumpf ,
No, the display unit from a Yoga 3-14 will not physically fit into a Yoga 330 as the Yoga 3 14 has a 14” screen and the Yoga 330 has a 11.6” screen.
Here’s a link to the service manual for your laptop, taken from this webpage (select hardware maintenance manual link left side of page)
Scroll to p.69 item #1 to view all the display assembly part numbers for the different variants of your laptop model.
Search online for suppliers of the part by typing the part number only (appropriate to your model variant), into the search box of your browser. (it may be that the part number is printed on the back of your display assembly so that you can verify that you have the correct part number).
Hopefully this is of some help
