Title: Shocking Discovery: Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display Charged Battery Still Needs To Be Plugged In For A Few Seconds! Find Out Why!

In recent years, the Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display has become a favorite among professionals and creatives in various fields. Its sleek, lightweight design and powerful performance have made it a popular choice for those who demand the best from their laptops. However, a recent discovery has left many Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display users shocked – even when their battery is fully charged, they still need to plug in their laptop for a few seconds. But why is this the case?

Firstly, it's important to understand how batteries work. All batteries have a certain capacity, which is a measure of how much charge they can hold. When your Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display is plugged in, it has access to an unlimited power source, so it can charge its battery up to its maximum capacity. This is why it's important to fully charge your battery when possible, as it will give you more time to work without needing to plug in.

However, even when your battery is fully charged, it doesn't mean that it's being used efficiently. When you're using your laptop on battery power, it's important to optimize your settings to save as much power as possible. But even with all the necessary tweaks, your laptop can't always operate at peak efficiency. This is where plugging in your laptop for a few seconds can make a big difference.

By plugging in your laptop for just a few seconds, you're giving it access to a burst of power that it can use to optimize its performance. This can lead to faster load times, smoother operation, and longer battery life. The reason this works is that when your laptop is plugged in, it can access more power than it can when running on battery power alone. This extra power means your laptop can work at its maximum efficiency, making the most of the battery charge it has available.

So, in conclusion, while it may seem odd that your Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display still needs to be plugged in for a few seconds even when the battery is fully charged, the reason is clear. By providing a burst of power to your laptop, you're optimizing its performance and making the most of the battery charge you have available. So the next time you're using your Macbook Pro 15 Retina Display and notice it's not running as smoothly as it should be, try plugging it in for a few seconds – you might be surprised at the difference it makes!

## Chosen Solution
 So I replaced the battery and it works great except for this one weird issue. The batter works and holds a charge. However, if I leave the laptop unplugged for more than an hour or so, it won't work when I try to use it unless I plug it in for a few seconds. Once I plug it in, it recognizes that the battery is actually charged (e.g. 83%) and it works like normal. Any ideas about what could be going on?

Here's what things look like when I plug it in for a few minutes.

 OK, let it fully charge, then you'll need to reset SMC then let the battery run down until is shuts its self off (not going to sleep). Then recharge the battery fully that should fix it.
