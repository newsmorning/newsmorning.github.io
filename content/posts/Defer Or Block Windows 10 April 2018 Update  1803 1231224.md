You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Defer or Block the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803 – Protect Your Computer Now!

If you're a Windows 10 user, you're probably aware that Microsoft releases updates to the operating system regularly. These updates are meant to improve the performance of your computer and address security vulnerabilities. However, the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803 has caused a lot of problems for users, and many want to defer or block it altogether. Fortunately, there are several ways to do so, and they're not complicated.

Defer the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803

The easiest way to defer the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803 is to change your Windows Update settings. This won't stop the update from being downloaded, but it will delay its installation. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.
2. Click on "Advanced options."
3. Under "Choose when updates are installed," select "Semi-Annual Channel" from the drop-down menu.
4. Restart your computer.

This will delay the installation of the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803 for up to 365 days. You can also defer quality updates for up to 30 days by selecting "Pause updates for 7 days" under "Update settings."

Block the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803

If you want to block the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803 completely, you can use the "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter tool provided by Microsoft. This tool allows you to hide or block specific updates from being installed on your computer. Here's how to use it:

1. Download the "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter tool from the Microsoft website.
2. Open the tool and click on "Advanced."
3. Select "Hide Updates."
4. Choose the update you want to block (in this case, the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803) and click "Next."
5. The tool will now hide the selected update, and it won't be installed on your computer.

This method is more aggressive than deferring the update, as it completely blocks it from being installed. However, it's a good option if you have experienced problems with the Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803 and want to avoid them in the future.

Protect Your Computer Now!

The Windows 10 April 2018 Update 1803 has caused a lot of headaches for users, from performance issues to hardware compatibility problems.

The April 2018 Update (version 1803) will be rolled out in a few weeks from now. The April 2018 Update is a feature update for Windows 10, meaning it includes new features, capabilities, and fixes.
 
When Microsoft rolls out a feature update to Windows 10, the update is rolled out in a phased manner, meaning that the update will not be available to everyone immediately. The update might take a few weeks of time to show up on your PC.
 









 
Feature updates are first made available to PC users who have subscribed to Windows Insider program before rolling out to everyone else. So, feature updates are mostly safe to install immediately after the public release.
 
That said, if you would like to wait and watch a few weeks or months before upgrading, you can block or defer the April 2018 Update on your Windows 10 PC.
 
In Windows 10, there is a provision to defer or block feature updates. Using this provision, you can defer, or block April 2018 Update up to 365 days.
 
Complete the directions given below to block or defer Windows 10 April 2018 Update up to 365 days.
 
## Defer or block Windows 10 April 2018 Update
 
Step 1: Open the Settings app. Navigate to Update & security > Windows Update.
 
Step 2: In the Update settings section, click Advanced options link.
 
Step 3: Scroll down to Choose when updates are installed section. Here, you will see “A feature update includes new capabilities and improvements. It can be deferred for this many days” option.
 
Select a number between 1 and 365 to defer the Windows 10 April 2018 Update for that many days. For instance, if you choose 365, Windows 10 April 2018 Update will not be installed via Windows Update for 365 days on your PC.
 
When you want to install the April 2018 Update, simply set back the value to 0 days.
 
## Another way to defer or block April 2018 Update
 
As you likely know, Windows 10 does not download Windows Updates over metered connections. You can defer April 2018 Update by setting your internet connection as metered. You can set both Wi-Fi networks and Ethernet as metered connection.
 
Refer to our how to set Wi-Fi as metered connection, and how to set Ethernet connection as metered in Windows 10 for step-by-step directions.
 
Note that Windows 10 might automatically download the April 2018 Update if and when you connect to a Wi-Fi network that is not set as metered on your PC.
 
Of course, you can also disable the Windows Update service to permanently disable the Windows Update, but that is something which we don’t recommend.
