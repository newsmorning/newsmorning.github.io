Is Your Washing Machine Possessed? The Sinister Hissing Sound You Need to Hear to Believe!

If you're like most people, your washing machine is an essential appliance in your home. It's hard to imagine life without the convenience of being able to quickly and easily clean your clothes. But, what if your washing machine is trying to tell you something? What if it's possessed? And, what if you're hearing a sinister hissing sound that you can't ignore?

Believe it or not, there are many possible causes of a hissing sound coming from your washing machine. Some of them are harmless, while others can be quite sinister. Let's take a closer look at this phenomenon to help you determine what's going on with your beloved appliance.

First, it's important to understand that a hissing sound coming from your washing machine is not normal. While there are certainly some sounds that are normal, such as the sound of water rushing into the machine, a hiss is a sign that something is not right. So, what could be causing this?

One of the most common causes of a hissing sound in a washing machine is a faulty water inlet valve. This valve is responsible for controlling the flow of water into the machine, and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it can cause a hissing sound. In some cases, the valve may need to be replaced.

Another possible cause is a clogged hose or drain. If the hose that carries water into the machine is clogged, it can cause a hissing sound. Similarly, if the drain is clogged, it can cause water to back up and create a hissing sound.

Finally, a hissing sound can also be a sign of a more serious issue, such as a damaged drum or motor. If you hear a hissing sound that is accompanied by a thumping or banging noise, it could be a sign that the machine's drum or motor is damaged and in need of repair.

So, what should you do if you hear a hissing sound coming from your washing machine? The first step is to try to determine the cause of the sound. Check the water inlet valve, hoses, and drain to see if any are clogged or damaged. If you're not sure, it's best to call a professional to take a look.

In the meantime, it's important to be careful. If the hissing sound is caused by a damaged drum or motor, the machine could be a safety hazard. It's best to avoid using the machine until it can be repaired by a professional.

In conclusion, a hissing sound coming from your washing machine is not something to take lightly. While some causes are harmless, others can be quite serious. If you hear a hissing sound, be sure to investigate the cause and take action to address the issue. Your safety and the safety of your appliance are too important to ignore.

## Chosen Solution
 I have LG Direct Drive Front load washing mashine, everything sounds and work fine except this annoying hissing sound when the drum (metal barrel) rotate during different wash cycles
its not a loud sound, to hear it you should isolate every sound in the surroundings
its like an electrical or magnet hiss sound i don’t know how to describe it,
it sounds like sssssssssss
please help because it’s irritating on long periods washing cycles
thank you all

 That is usually the water inlet valve leaking.  Do you ever have a little water in the tub after it has been sitting for a while?  Is there a specific action the machine is doing when you hear it?
