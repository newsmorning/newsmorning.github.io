We purchased Logitech's G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

Logitech is a go-to brand for gamers looking for a lag-free wireless mouse. The G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse is an updated version of the company’s G602, and based on the spec sheet alone, the new version looks like an ideal companion for a MMO, MOBA, or Battle Royale gamer. We tested the G604 to see how well it performs in real time. Through hours of gameplay, we evaluated the mouse’s design, controls, comfort, software, and overall feel to ultimately determine whether or not the peripheral is worth its price tag.

 
##   Design: Attractive, but a little large  
 

The G604 is relatively large, clocking in at 130 mm tall, 80 mm wide, and 45 mm in depth. It has a full thumb rest and 15 customizable controls, six of which are micro buttons located on top of where your thumb sits along the thumb rest. The thumb rest is on the left side of the device, so the mouse is designed for right-handed players.

 

The all-matte black finish is aesthetically pleasing and should look good with most rigs, while the textured, rubberized finish on the center of the mouse adds some grip. The scroll wheel is solid metal, and combined with a AA battery and big chassis mean the mouse weighs 135 grams, on the heavier side.

The battery cover has a weak magnet to help it stay in place, and so far we haven’t had the battery cover accidentally slip off during gameplay.

 
##   Setup Process: Plug and play  
 

Crack open the box and you’ll find the G604 mouse with the USB connector stored inside the battery cover, a single AA-alkaline battery, an adapter that allows you to extend your USB connection, documentation materials, and a logo sticker. Connecting the mouse to your rig is simple, as you pretty much just slip the battery into the mouse, plug the USB dongle into your computer, and play (or pair it via Bluetooth).

 
##   Software: Uses Logitech’s latest, though perhaps not greatest  
 

You perform the G604’s customization and firmware updates through Logitech’s G Hub software (in lieu of the older Logitech Gaming Software that many fans of Logitech accessories have grown fond of). After exploring G Hub for several hours, we grew to like the software, but not love it. 

 

In G Hub, you can assign buttons with commands from a list or go much more in depth. 

 

The Macros section is incredibly useful. This is where you can program custom commands that aren’t already on the list. You can create a macro that adds a modifier to a key command (like Shift or Alt), performs repeat actions (like constant mouse clicking with one button push), or executes a sequence. You can also assign system controls, and use the G Hub software to adjust your mouse’s CPI (its sensitivity). 

 

You can also set up game-specific profiles in G Hub. When you run a game for which you’ve created a profile the software will automatically activate it, which can be finicky at times, but you can also just make a single, persistent profile.

 
##   Performance: Precise movement and a long battery-life  
 

The G604 delivers precise movement and pinpoint accuracy. This is due in large part to the mouse’s HERO (High Efficiency Rated Optical)16K sensor, the product of extensive research and development. The HERO accurately tracks at up to 400 inches per second with zero smoothing or filtering, which means it can keep up with even your wildest sweeping movements. The G604 lets you adjust the sensitivity between 100 and 16,000 CPI, so it can be as responsive (or sluggish) as you want. 

 

We ran the device through mouse input lag testing and click latency testing, where the G604 performed exceptionally well. The Lightspeed wireless connection proves to be at least as efficient as a hard-wired connection. 

 

More importantly, we also tested the G604 during gameplay. We played hours of Apex Legends, World of Warcraft Classic, and a few hours of Battlerite. The ability to assign multiple different keys to the side micro buttons was extremely useful, as we didn’t have to reach for out-of-the-way keys. There was never a point when the cursor was playing catch up, nor was there any noticeable input lag.

You can switch the G604 between Bluetooth and Lightspeed mode via the dongle. Although we haven’t used the Bluetooth mode as much as the Lightspeed mode, the Bluetooth mode is nice to have if you’re short on USB ports (or lose the dongle). 

 

The battery life is impressive, as it lasts for up to 240 hours. In Bluetooth mode, the battery lasts for up to five and a half months. The battery goes into standby mode when you’re not using the device, so you don’t have to worry about switching the mouse on and off. 

 
##   Comfort: Quickly feels like your mouse  
 

A gaming mouse should feel like an extension of your hand. The ideal gaming mouse is one you don’t think about—the controls should feel so natural that you use it without thinking. You shouldn’t have to make concessions to make the mouse fit your needs. 

 

When you game with the G604, it may take a few matches or levels for it to feel like your mouse (especially if you’re moving up from a smaller and more lightweight mouse, like the Razer DeathAdder Elite or the Logitech G302). However, in about a day, the mouse should start to feel just right. 

 

The ergonomic G604 has a full thumb rest, and the six micro buttons that sit above your rested thumb are ideally positioned, so you can press the front buttons with the tip of your thumb and the back buttons with the center of your thumb. 

 

You can switch the scroll wheel between continuous/hyper scroll and ratcheted scroll. Plus, the scroll wheel has left and right tilt. Behind the scroll wheel, there are two buttons, which by default change the scroll wheel between continuous or ratcheted scroll and switch the mouse between Lightspeed and Bluetooth mode. However, these buttons are perhaps the most difficult buttons to access, as you have to move your index or middle finger out of position to press them. 

 

Along the side of the main left-click button, there are plus and minus buttons you use to adjust the DPI (by default). The plus and minus buttons are easy to access, although the customization options for these particular buttons cooperate better with some games than others.

 
##   Price: Worth the extra money  
 

The Logitech G604 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse retails for $100, which is on the expensive side. But for an extra $50 bucks or so, you’re getting a wireless mouse with exceptional performance, accuracy, and deep customization options. 

 
##   Logitech G604 vs. Logitech G602   
 

The G604 is an upgraded version of Logitech’s G602—a smaller wireless mouse with a lower max CPI that features Logitech’s Delta Zero sensor. We have no major complaints about the more affordable G602, but it’s beginning to show its age. 

 

However, the 602 uses Logitech Gaming Software for its configurations, which some people may prefer if they’re still using LGS for their other accessories (like headsets and keyboards). The G602 retails for $80, but you can often find it on sale for around $40 to $50. 

 
Hits the right marks.The Logitech G604 is a quality wireless gaming mouse that’s comfortable and adaptable. With some characteristics of high end peripherals designed for professional (Esports) players, and other features you’d see in a more affordable accessory, some might say the G604 seems a bit disjointed. But because it excels in areas where it counts, like accuracy and speed, and because it’s loaded with a huge swath of buttons, MMO and MOBA players will appreciate what the G604 has to offer.
