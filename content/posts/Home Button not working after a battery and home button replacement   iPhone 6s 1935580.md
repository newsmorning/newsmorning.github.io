# iPhone 6S Users Beware: Battery and Home Button Replacement Causes Glitch that Renders Home Button Useless!

If you own an iPhone 6S and have recently had your battery or home button replaced by a third-party repair service, you may want to read this article carefully. It appears that a glitch triggered by a software update could cause your home button to become unresponsive, forcing you to use an on-screen AssistiveTouch button instead.

The issue has been reported by several iPhone 6S users who had their battery or home button replaced by non-Apple services. According to them, after updating to iOS 11.3, their home button stopped working properly. Some users also reported a rapid battery drain issue, which could be related to the same glitch.

Apple has acknowledged the problem and warned that third-party repairs could damage certain components or alter the software, leading to various issues. The company advises customers to always use authorized Apple service providers to avoid such problems.

However, many iPhone 6S users have turned to third-party services to save money on costly repairs. These services may use non-original parts or perform the repair incorrectly, which could damage the phone or void its warranty. This is especially true for battery and home button replacements, which are delicate procedures that require expertise and specialized equipment.

Replacing the battery of an iPhone 6S involves opening the device and disconnecting various cables, risking damage to the screen or other components. If the battery is not a genuine Apple part, it may not work properly or even pose a fire hazard. Similarly, replacing the home button may lead to problems with Touch ID or other features that require the button.

The glitch affecting some iPhone 6S units is related to the pairing of the home button and the logic board, which is encrypted and tied to the Secure Enclave chip. If this pairing is disrupted, the home button may stop working or trigger a software lock-out that prevents its use. The only solution to this issue is to restore the device to its original state by replacing the home button or logic board with genuine Apple parts.

In conclusion, if you own an iPhone 6S and need to replace your battery or home button, it's important to choose a reputable and authorized service provider to avoid potential glitches or damage. While third-party services may offer cheaper options, they may also compromise the functionality and stability of your device. Apple provides a list of authorized service providers on its website, and you can also find reviews and recommendations from other customers to help you make an informed decision. Don't risk losing your home button or facing other problems by choosing the wrong repair option.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the battery in a iPhone 6s and the home button stopped working, so I thought I’d try replacing the home button too. But it still doesn’t work. I’ve tried easing the tension on the flex cables and that hasn’t changed anything. I’m a bit stumped.

 did you check properly if your lcd flex connector to the board is properly connected or your home button to the lcd.

 when you opened the phone and removed the LCD screen assembly to pull the old battery, did you disconnect the battery first?
when you put the phone back together, reconnecting the motherboard to the new LCD screen, did you connect the battery last?
if you answered “no” to either or both, it’s possible that you may have shorted something out working the connectors with the battery attached.  that’s just a possibility.
another situation could be some dust or debris that got into the FCP socket during the repair and is blocking a contact or two.  i’d disassemble the phone again.  visually inspect all the connectors (plugs and sockets) that you disconnected/reconnected.  personally, i’d use a touch of 99% IPA and a soft toothbrush to clean the contacts.  if you’re not comfortable doing that, you don’t have to.  or, even though apple says not to use compressed air, you can very, very gently blow a low pressure puff (a very light press) across the connectors to blow any dust out.  do not use high pressure and do not use your own breath (you’d be surprised how much micro-droplets of saliva actually come out in what you think is a dry breath.
i’d actually put the original button back in and re-test, but bear in mind the home button connector as well as all the flex cables are very easy to damage if you’re not careful.  hopefully this isn’t the case, but it’s a possibility
