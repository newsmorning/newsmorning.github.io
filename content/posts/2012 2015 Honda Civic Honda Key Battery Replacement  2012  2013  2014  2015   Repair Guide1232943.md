# Beware! Your Honda Civic Key Battery Might Die Anytime - Here's How to Replace It Like A Pro!

Your car key is an essential tool that you use every day to unlock and start your Honda Civic. However, most people don't pay much attention to the key battery, which can lead to a sudden key failure at the most inconvenient time. That's why you should always keep an eye on the battery's condition and replace it when necessary. Here's how you can do it like a pro!

## Check Your Key Battery

Before you start replacing your key battery, you should know how to check if it really needs to be replaced. There are a few signs to watch out for:

* The key doesn't work, or it works intermittently.
* The key's range is reduced, and you need to be closer to the car to unlock or start it.
* You notice a low battery warning on the dashboard.

If you experience any of these issues, it's time to replace your key battery.

## Get the Right Battery

The first step in replacing your key battery is to get the right one. Fortunately, it's a straightforward process:

* Check your car's owner's manual for the battery type and model number.
* You can also find this information on the battery itself. It's usually a 3-volt lithium CR2032 battery.
* Make sure you buy a high-quality battery from a reputable brand. Don't go for the cheapest option available, as it might not last very long.

## Replace the Battery

Now that you have the right battery, it's time to replace it in your Honda Civic key. Here's how to do it:

1. Use a flathead screwdriver or a similar tool to pop open the key fob. You can do this by inserting the tool in the small slot on the side of the key fob and gently prying it open.

2. Once the key fob is open, you'll see the old battery. Use your fingers or a tool to remove it.

3. Insert the new battery in the same position as the old one. Make sure the positive (+) and negative (-) sides are facing the right direction.

4. Close the key fob by firmly pressing the two halves together until you hear a click.

That's it! You have successfully replaced the battery in your Honda Civic key.

## Conclusion

Replacing the battery in your Honda Civic key is a simple but essential task that will ensure you never get stuck with a dead key. Remember to check your key's battery regularly and replace it when necessary. Always use high-quality batteries and follow the steps outlined above to do it like a pro.

The original battery in my 2012 Honda Civic Key is a Panasonic CR1616, not a CR1620. I bought an Energizer CR1620, and it was too thick.

This isn't the same key remote that I have for my 2015 Civic Si (Sedan). Mine is more square shaped and the key is removable from the inside of the device. It also has no apparent opening-point anywhere around it. The only spot I would consider a possible entry point would be where the key is removed.

Robert;
 
Yes, once the key is removed it is just a matter prying it apart from between the two ears that stick up from the center. A fairly thick flat-bladed screw driver will do it (i used the handle end of a tweezer that was handy). This takes a CR2032 battery, (3) volt, very commonly found. There are two little tabs holding it in, plus (+) side up. Just snap it all back together. Voila.
