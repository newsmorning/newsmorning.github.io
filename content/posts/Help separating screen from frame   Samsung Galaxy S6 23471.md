# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Separate The Screen From The Frame Of Your Samsung Galaxy S6 - A Step-By-Step Guide!

The Samsung Galaxy S6 is a great phone with a sleek design and stunning features. However, accidents happen, and the most common damage on smartphones is a cracked or shattered screen. The good news is, if you're facing this issue, you don't need to replace your entire phone - you just need to replace the screen. But before getting to that, you'll need to separate the screen from the frame of your Samsung Galaxy S6. And the better news is, it's not as hard as you might think. In this step-by-step guide, we'll show you how to easily separate the screen from the frame of your Samsung Galaxy S6.

## What You Will Need

- A flat and safe working surface
- A hairdryer or a heat gun
- A plastic pick or blade
- A suction cup

## Step 1 - Power Down The Phone

Before starting, make sure that your phone is turned off, and the battery is removed. This will prevent any mishaps from occurring.

## Step 2 - Heat The Edge

The adhesive holding the screen to the frame is often quite strong. Heating the edge with a hairdryer or a heat gun will make it easier to separate the screen.  Hold the heat source around the edges of the screen for 2-3 minutes before proceeding.

## Step 3 - Use A Plastic Pick

Once the adhesive has been heated, use a plastic pick or blade to gently pry the screen away from the frame. Insert the tool between the screen and the frame and work around the edges until you're confident that it's loosened up.

## Step 4 - Apply Suction

Next, apply a suction cup to the screen. Make sure it sticks firmly and evenly across the center. This will help to keep the screen from lifting up while you work with the tool.

## Step 5 - Continue Separating The Screen

With the suction cup, you can now apply pressure to the screen and continue separating it from the frame with the plastic pick or blade. Slowly work your way around the edges of the screen until it is entirely separated from the frame.

## Step 6 - Remove Adhesive

Once the screen has been separated, remove any remaining adhesive residue from the frame. Use a cleaning solution to remove any leftover adhesive.

Congratulations! You have successfully separated the screen from the frame of your Samsung Galaxy S6. Now it's time to replace the screen or have it professionally repaired. Always remember to work patiently and carefully when repairing your phone. 

## Wrapping Up

Separating the screen from the frame of your Samsung Galaxy S6 can feel daunting, but with the right tools and a little patience, it's a task you can accomplish in no time. Following the steps we've outlined in this guide, you can easily replace the damaged screen of your phone and save yourself the cost of replacing an entire device.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I'm strugging with removing the display as described in step 30 of this guide:
Galaxy S6 (Verizon) Charging Daughter Board
I've destroyed two displays trying to slip the guitar pick between the frame and the display. Each time I end up sliding the pick underneath the black backing of the LCD exposing the silver material inside the LCD. In the guide it shows the blue pick sliding from the outside of the frame and then being visible when it reaches the inside part of the frame. Whenever I do it, the pick slides under the frame and is not visible when it reaches the inside portion of the frame. I am using heat to soften the adhesive.
Please help!

 Are you doing charging port replacements on S6?
I strongly advise against removing the screen to do charging ports on these as damaging the LCD is almost guaranteed.
The more ideal way to do it is to shield the components with thermal tape / kapton tape surrounding the charging port, and replace the charging port itself via soldering / micro-soldering. You will need to lift up the charging daughter board a bit so that it's away from the phone's mid-frame to distance it away from the screen.
I use a hot-air rework station to remove the charging port from the daughterboard to replace it. There should be some videos on YouTube on how to do this.
