# Without This Tiny Piece, Your Toshiba Laptop Is Useless: The Hunt for the Elusive CMOS Tab Connector!

If you are a Toshiba laptop owner, you may have come across a problem where your laptop won't turn on or boot up. This could be caused by a variety of reasons, but one of the most common ones is a faulty CMOS Tab Connector. This tiny piece of hardware is responsible for keeping your laptop's clock and system settings intact even when it's turned off. Without it, your laptop is useless. But don't worry, in this article, we'll get into the details of what a CMOS Tab Connector is, why it's important, and how you can get your hands on one.

## What is a CMOS Tab Connector?

The CMOS Tab Connector is a small piece of hardware that connects the laptop's motherboard to the battery. It is responsible for keeping the laptop's clock and system settings intact even when the laptop is turned off. The CMOS Tab Connector is an essential component of any computer or laptop that uses a CMOS battery to power its internal clock and the system settings.

## Why is it important?

As mentioned earlier, the CMOS Tab Connector is responsible for keeping your laptop's clock and system settings intact even when it's turned off. Without it, your laptop's battery will drain faster, and you will lose all your system settings every time you turn off your laptop. This can be a frustrating and time-consuming issue to deal with.

## How to get your hands on a CMOS Tab Connector?

The biggest hurdle in finding a CMOS Tab Connector is that it is not readily available in computer or electronic stores. You cannot buy it as a separate part, and the only way to get it is to buy a new motherboard. And that's an expensive and time-consuming process that is not worth the effort if you have an otherwise working laptop.

That said, some online stores sell the CMOS Tab Connector as a separate part, but you need to search carefully. Some of the best online stores to check for these connectors include eBay, Amazon, and Alibaba. Do your research, and you might find a seller who has the connector you need.

Another option is to contact Toshiba's customer service center and order a replacement connector. You will need to provide them with the specific model number of your laptop and the part number of the connector. Keep in mind that this process can be time-consuming as you will need to wait for the connector to be shipped to you.

## Conclusion

The CMOS Tab Connector may be a tiny piece, but it's an essential component in any Toshiba laptop that uses a CMOS battery to power its internal clock and system settings. If your laptop's CMOS Tab Connector is faulty, you need to replace it to avoid losing your system settings every time you turn off your laptop. Getting a new motherboard is not always practical or possible, but with some research, you can find an online seller or contact Toshiba's customer service center to order a replacement connector.


## Chosen Solution
 I need the CMOS tab connecter information for a Toshiba Satellite c855-s5194 Motherboard PN: 1310A2541004 BD SYSTEM. On boot bios password is required and this is not known. Have pulled Battery and there are no visible CMOS terminals to be found on the system board. Tried all possible answers so hope there is an expert answer here.

 IF resetting the CMOS will clear the BIOS pw is unknown. For some systems yes. There is mothing in the manual about resetting the CMOS. Without the CMOS jumper, the next thing is to remove the battery. If the main battery is still in, remove that also. Short the CMOS battery holder terminal or let the unpowered computer sit for a long while. Reassemble. Maybe you will get lucky.
