If you're an iPhone 6 user, you might want to be aware of a critical home button malfunction that has been discovered. Apple has confirmed the issue, which makes it difficult for users to access important features on their devices.

The home button is a vital component of the iPhone. It serves as the primary way to exit apps, go back to the home screen, and unlock the device. However, if the home button doesn't work correctly, it can become frustrating and negatively affect the user experience.

The issue reportedly affects iPhone 6 devices that were manufactured between 2014 and 2015. Users have reported that the home button becomes unresponsive or feels "sticky" when pressed. In some cases, there may be a delay in the response time, or the button may not work at all.

So, is your device affected? If you're an iPhone 6 user, it's essential to check if your device is one of those affected by the malfunction. You can follow these steps to check:

1. Go to Settings > General > About.

2. Look for the Model number.

3. If the Model number starts with "A1549," then it's an iPhone 6.

4. Check the fourth and fifth digits of the serial number. If they're within the range of VQ, VR, VS, VT, VU, or VX, then your device may be affected.

If your device is affected, don't worry. Apple has offered a solution to the problem. The company has acknowledged the issue and is providing free repairs for affected devices. You can take your iPhone 6 to an Apple store or an authorized repair center to get it fixed.

In conclusion, if you're an iPhone 6 user, it's crucial to make sure your device is not affected by the home button malfunction. If it is, get it fixed as soon as possible. The home button is a vital component of the iPhone, and without it working correctly, you may face difficulties accessing important features.

## Chosen Solution
 Just wondering if anybody has any other troubleshooting methods to get the button working again, fingerprint sensor works fine
- Replaced home button extension cable
- Restored/updated phone
- tried recalibrating
or does anybody know a shop that can transfer the IC etc over to a new home button?
The cable hasn't been ripped and it just stopped working

 It is possible that the small part under the button is damaged ( I forgot what it is called)

But if you can fill the "Click" or you know the part is not Damaged follow these steps
1.Press the Sleep/Wake button to lock your device.                                                                                                                   2.Wait a couple of seconds.
3.Press the Home button. Your device should wake up.
If your device doesn't wake up, follow these steps. Test the Home button after each step:
1.Restart your device.
2.Check for debris or dirt around the Home button and clean it with a soft cloth.                                                      3.Remove any protective film or case that covers the Home button.
If the Home button still doesn't wake the device, or if the button is damaged, contact Apple Support.
