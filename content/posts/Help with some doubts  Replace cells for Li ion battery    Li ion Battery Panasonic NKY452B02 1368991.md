## Chosen Solution
 This battery is a Panasonic 25.2V 13.2Ah Li-ion battery for an electric bicycle. It is 7 or 8 years old.  When new, a full charge was good for 70km and now just  20km. Buying a new battery from Panasonic costs 304 USD and sending it to a third party to have the Li-ion batteries inside costs 210 USD and 290USD. And they only guarantee  60 to 80% or the original charge in the cheaper option and 80% in the more expensive one. So it is better to spend the money on a new one or so I thought . The “cells” inside the battery are normal 18650 Li-ion batteries and the are pretty cheap, even the Sony branded ones. 20USd for a pack of 4 I think and there are some even cheaper on amazon-jp 

I found a video in youtube for the exact model as my battery, the guy just tears the battery apart and doesn’t show how he changed the li-ion batteries or how he welded them together (  watch?v=yH_ZpWyQtzY  ).
So my question is, why are the batteries in the center mixed with negative and positive and the side ones just positive or negative. I will just follow the same pattern to avoid any issues, just wondering WHY??!!.
Checa the before and after from that video and see how the center batteries are mixing + and - on the same side (same circuit?).



I am also buying a cheap spot welder from amazon to weld the batteries to my DIY metal board, the original was torn apart in the process of freeing the batteries inside. Like in the image below.

Any help, regarding  the correct way to handle Li-ion batteries will be much much appreciated, by me and my wallet.

 @ecolmi the original 18650 Li-ion batteries  is a 3.7V and somewhere between 1800mAh and 3500mAh (mili-amp-hours).   In order to get the voltage and the amperage needed by your bike (25.2V 13.2Ah  ), the batteries are connected in series and some in parallel. It’s called series-parallel. Take a look on here for an indepth explanation. We would have to see a picture of exactly they individually are connected to do the math :-)
So, when you rebuild yours, make sure that you absolutely follow the old one for your pattern . Li-ion batteries are finicky and you would not want anything to go off in smoke. I’ve rebuild battery packs for power tools etc. and have not had any big issues. I do not have a fancy spotwelder so I use a soldering iron :-)
