If you're a fan of bagels, then you know the importance of a good toaster with a bagel switch. A bagel switch ensures that your bagel is toasted perfectly, with the cut side crispy and the other side soft and warm. But did you know that there's a tiny part that could make or break your breakfast routine? That's right, we're talking about the crumb tray for your GE bagel switch toaster.

Why is the crumb tray so important?

The crumb tray is where all the crumbs from your toast and bagels collect. It's a small part that is often overlooked, but it plays a vital role in keeping your toaster clean and functioning properly. If the crumb tray is not emptied regularly, it can cause your toaster to malfunction. The crumbs can also start to burn, which can result in a fire hazard.

How can you get the part number?

If your GE bagel switch toaster is missing a crumb tray or if your current crumb tray is damaged or broken, you'll need to get a replacement. The best way to get the part number and purchase a new crumb tray is by contacting GE directly. You can call their customer service line or visit their website to find the part number and place an order.

Why is this urgent?

If you're someone who enjoys their bagels and toast in the morning, you know how important it is to have a functioning toaster. You don't want to be left without your favorite breakfast because your toaster is out of commission. Furthermore, a malfunctioning toaster can be a safety hazard in your home, so it's essential to keep your toaster in good condition.

In conclusion, the crumb tray may seem like a small and insignificant part of your GE bagel switch toaster, but it plays a crucial role in keeping your breakfast routine on track. If you notice that your crumb tray is missing, damaged or broken, be sure to contact GE customer service to get the part number and order a replacement. Don't let a tiny part ruin your morning routine. Take action now to keep your toaster functioning properly and enjoy your bagels and toast as you like them.

## Chosen Solution
 I lost my book for the toaster , and was wondering how do I get a replacement manual with parts numbers in it

 I do not think there is one out there
You best bet is to contact General Electric and tell them the part you need
