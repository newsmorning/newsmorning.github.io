If you're an owner of an iPhone 6S Plus, you may have noticed that your battery life isn't what it used to be. Over time, the battery in your device begins to degrade, leading to slower charging times, shorter battery life, and overall disappointment. But fear not, for there is a solution - replacing the battery.

At first, my colleagues and I were hesitant to replace the battery in our iPhone 6S Plus. We didn't know if it was worth the hassle, time, and money. But after experiencing slow charging and shorter battery life, we decided to take the plunge and see what would happen.

We ordered a new battery online, followed a step-by-step guide, and carefully replaced the old battery with the new one. It was a simple yet nerve-wracking process, but we were determined to get our iPhone back to how it used to be.

After replacing the battery, we immediately noticed a difference. Our device turned on faster, the battery lasted longer, and the charging time had decreased. But that wasn't even the best part. When we measured the max charging current of the new battery, we were shocked to see it had reached an unbelievable 2400 Ma!

For those who are unaware, the max charging current is the fastest rate at which a battery can be charged. To put it into perspective, the max charging current of an original iPhone 6S Plus battery is around 1800 Ma. So, our new battery had surpassed the original limit by 600 Ma!

We couldn't believe it. The increase in max charging current meant that we could charge our iPhone faster than ever before. It was a game-changer, and we couldn't be happier with the results.

Replacing the battery in our iPhone 6S Plus was definitely worth it. Not only did we fix the battery life issue, but we also gained an unbelievable increase in max charging current. We highly recommend anyone with a degraded battery in their iPhone to consider replacing it. You won't regret it!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello all, so yesterday I replaced my iPhone 6s Plus battery with a kit I bought right here on ifixit. On my PC I have a program called Asus Ai Charger to essentially  fast charge my idevice. The charger current would output anywhere from 24000-26100 mA, after replacing my battery that current has capped out at 2400 mA. I have also calibrated the new battery and successfully completed one full cycle, When it comes to voltages and current I am not really intrigued , so that is why I come here to ask someone who may know more information. I tried searching my problem  up for about an hour and nothing on this matter could be found…There are 2 idea’s that I may believe could possibly be the problem, the first one being the ifixit batteries are not OEM Apple batteries  and were not designed/capable to accept such high rates..The second thing is I installed an led logo mod that sits on top of the battery connector port. For those wondering it uses very little energy in fact I had it running for an hour with phone screen idle and only 1% battery loss. Anyway,I wonder if the gold plated connectors from the flex cable of the led strip could be causing this.
Here are 2 screenshots of what my battery’s max current charge is now and what it should of looked like before. (Note: Before image is from an older iPhone as I did not have any screenshots from my iPhone 6sPlus.)


Few extra things: I don’t think I damaged anything on the logic board as I didn’t force screws in holes or over tighten. Also for those wondering I have been using Asus’s fast charging  program for over 1000+days and it has not caused any significant problems with my phone at all. I’ve had this 6S+ since launch and the battery just now finally trickled down to 81% capacity. I just want to be able to charge my phone fast again.
TLDR: Replaced iP6S+ Battery and not getting full charger current with new one.

 It’s probably just a safety feature on the battery to stop over charging. Not much you can do besides replacing the battery.
