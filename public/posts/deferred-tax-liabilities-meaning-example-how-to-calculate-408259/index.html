Do you find yourself scratching your head when it comes to calculating deferred tax liabilities? Are you confused about how to factor in potential future taxes on your financial statements? This guide will help you understand the basics of deferred tax liabilities and provide real-life examples to help you calculate them like a pro.\nWhat are Deferred Tax Liabilities? Deferred tax liabilities (DTL) are taxes that a company or individual owes but has not yet paid. They are called “deferred” because they are expected to be paid in the future, not currently. DTLs are typically created when the financial accounting methods used to prepare financial statements do not match the tax accounting methods used to file tax returns.\nWhen a company or individual reports income on its financial statement, it must also report its estimated tax expense for that income. The tax expense is an estimate of the taxes that the company or individual will owe for that income when it files its tax return. However, because the financial statement reports income on an accrual basis, and taxes are calculated on a cash basis, there can be differences in the timing of income and tax recognition.\nWhen income is recognized in a financial statement but not yet taxed, a DTL is created. This is because the income has already been recognized for financial statement purposes, but the tax expense associated with that income has not yet been recognized for tax purposes. As a result, the company or individual must “defer” the recognition of the tax expense until the tax return is filed in a future period.\nHow to Calculate Deferred Tax Liabilities Calculating DTLs can be complex, but the following steps can help simplify the process:\nDetermine the difference between the tax basis and the financial accounting basis of each asset and liability. Calculate the tax rate that will be in effect when the asset or liability is settled. Multiply the difference in the tax and financial accounting basis by the applicable tax rate. Add up all of the DTLs you have calculated to get the total. Here is an example of how to apply these steps in a real-life scenario:\nSuppose a company purchased a machine for $100,000. The company depreciates this machine over five years for both financial accounting and tax purposes. However, the tax code allows for a more accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes, resulting in a lower taxable income and therefore lower taxes.\nThe financial accounting basis for the machine after three years is $60,000, while the tax basis is $40,000. The company expects to settle the tax liability related to this machine in two years, at a tax rate of 35%.\nTo calculate the DTL for this machine, we would use the following formula:\n($60,000 - $40,000) x 35% = $7,000\nThis means that the company would owe an additional $7,000 in taxes when it files its tax return in two years, resulting in a deferred tax liability of $7,000.\nWhy Deferred Tax Liabilities are Important DTLs are important because they can significantly impact a company’s financial statements. They can affect key financial metrics such as earnings per share, net income, and income taxes payable. As a result, companies must include DTLs on their financial statements to provide investors and stakeholders with an accurate picture of their financial health.\nDTLs can also impact a company’s future tax liabilities. If a company has a significant DTL, it may be at risk of future tax audits or penalties. Therefore, it is important for companies to carefully calculate and manage their DTLs to avoid any potential legal or financial issues.\nConclusion In conclusion, understanding deferred tax liabilities is crucial for any business or individual that wants to accurately reflect its financial position. By following the steps outlined above and using real-life examples, you can calculate DTLs like a pro and ensure that your financial statements are accurate and reliable.\nDeferred Tax Liabilities Meaning In simple words, Deferred tax liabilities are created when income tax expense (income statement item) is higher than taxes payable (tax return), and the difference is expected to reverse. DTL is the amount of income taxes payable in future periods due to temporary taxable differences.\nYou are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Deferred Tax Liabilities (wallstreetmojo.com)\nThey are created when the income tax expense is higher than the taxes payable.

The income tax expense equation that equates tax expenses recognized in the income statement and taxes payable to the tax authorities, and changes in deferred tax assetsChanges In Deferred Tax AssetsA deferred tax asset is an asset to the Company that usually arises when either the Company has overpaid taxes or paid advance tax. Such taxes are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and are eventually paid back to the Company or deducted from future taxes.read more and liabilities are below:\nIncome Tax Expense= taxes payable + DTL – DTA\nDeferred Tax Liabilities Example A good example is when a firm uses an accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes and a straight-line method of depreciationStraight-line Method Of DepreciationStraight Line Depreciation Method is one of the most popular methods of depreciation where the asset uniformly depreciates over its useful life and the cost of the asset is evenly spread over its useful and functional life. read more method for financial reporting. A deferred tax liability considers that the company will pay more income tax because of the transaction that has happened in the current period, for example, installment sale receivableInstallment Sale ReceivableAn installment sale is a revenue recognition method. The seller allows the buyer to make payment in installments over the specified period without fully transferring risk and rewards at the time of sale. The seller recognizes the revenue and expense while collecting cash rather than at the time of sale.read more.\nBelow is the company’s income statement for financial reportingFinancial ReportingFinancial reporting is a systematic process of recording and representing a company’s financial data.

We have not changed the income and expenses numbers to highlight this concept.\nHere we assumed that the Asset is worth $1,000 with a useful life of 3 years and is depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method – year 1 – $333, year 2 – $333, and year three as $334.\nWe note that the Tax Expense is $350 for all three years. Let us now assume that for tax reporting purposes, the company uses an accelerated method of depreciationAccelerated Method Of DepreciationAccelerated depreciation is a way of depreciating assets at a faster rate than the straight-line method, resulting in higher depreciation expenses in the early years of the asset’s useful life than in the later years. The assumption that assets are more productive in the early years than in later years is the main motivation for using this method. read more. The depreciationDepreciationDepreciation is a systematic allocation method used to account for the costs of any physical or tangible asset throughout its useful life. Its value indicates how much of an asset’s worth has been utilized. Depreciation enables companies to generate revenue from their assets while only charging a fraction of the cost of the asset in use each year. read more profile is like this – year 1 – $500, year 2 – $500, and year 3 – $0\nWe note that the Tax Payable for Year 1 is $300, Year 2 is $300, and Year 3 is $450. As discussed above, using two different kinds of depreciation for financial reporting and tax purposes results in deferred taxes.\nCalculation of Deferred Tax Liability. Deferred Tax Liability Formula = Income Tax Expense – Taxes Payable + Deferred Tax Assets\nYear 1 – DTL = $350 – $300 + 0 = $50Year 2 – DTL = $350 – $300 + 0 = $50Year 3 – DTL = $350 – $450 + 0 = -$100 Cumulative Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance SheetBalance SheetA balance sheet is one of the financial statements of a company that presents the shareholders’ equity, liabilities, and assets of the company at a specific point in time.

It is the future tax payment a company is expected to pay to the tax authorities.DTL is expected to reverse, i.e., caused by temporary differences, and result in future cash flows when the taxes are paid. It is most often created when an accelerated depreciation method is used on the tax return and straight-line depreciation is used on the income statement.In simpler terms, it is the amount of taxes a company has underpaid which will be made up in the future. It does not mean that the company has not fulfilled its obligation; rather, the fact is paying the obligation on a different timetable.For example, a company that has earned net income for a specific year understands the fact that it has to pay corporate income taxesCorporate Income TaxesCorporate tax is a tax levied by the government on the profits earned by a company at a fixed rate each year and is calculated in accordance with specific tax regulations.read more. Since the tax liability is applicable for the current year, it must reflect an expense for the same period. But in this scenario, the tax will not be paid until the next calendar year. To rectify this cash timing difference, the company records the tax as the deferred tax liability. Effect of Tax Rate Changes When the tax rate changes DTL is adjusted to reflect the transition to the new rate, and DTL values on the balance sheet must be changed as the new tax rate is the rate expected to be in force when the associated reversals occur.An increase in the tax rate will increase both firms’ deferred tax liabilities and assets in their income tax expense. A decrease in the tax rate will decrease a firm’s DTA and income tax expense.Changes in the balance sheet values of deferred tax liabilities and assets need to be accounted for the change in the tax rate that will affect income tax expense in the current period.Income tax expense= taxes payable + DTL – DTA. If rates increase, the increase in the DTL is added to the tax payable, and the increase in the DTA is subtracted from the tax payable to arrive at income tax expense. Deferred Tax Liabilities Video Conclusion To summarize, if taxable income (on the tax return) is less than pre-tax income (on the income statement) and the difference is expected to reverse in the future years, the deferred tax liability is created. DTL will result in future cash outflows when the taxes are paid. DTL is most commonly created when an accelerated depreciation method is used on the tax return, and straight-line depreciation is used on the income statement. For an analyst, this line item of the financial statementThe Financial StatementFinancial statements are written reports prepared by a company’s management to present the company’s financial affairs over a given period (quarter, six monthly or yearly).
