Title: You Won't Believe What Happened After We Replaced Our iPad Mini 4 LTE Screen - Home Button Failure!

Introduction:

iPads have become the go-to devices for most people looking to bridge the gap between smartphones and personal computers. The iPad Mini 4 LTE is one such device that provides perfect portability and amazing features. However, like most electronic gadgets, iPads are prone to damage, particularly on the screen. This has led to many users seeking screen replacement services, which in some cases comes with its own headaches.

In this article, we'll take a look at one such headache: Home button failure after replacing the iPad Mini 4 LTE screen.

Main Body:

We recently experienced a scenario where we had to replace an iPad Mini 4 LTE screen for a client. The screen had cracked, and the only viable solution was to replace it. We followed the usual steps in replacing an iPad screen, carefully removing the old screen, disconnecting the cables, and replacing it with a new screen.

Once we were done replacing the screen, everything seemed to work great, and our client was satisfied with the results. The iPad could turn on, the touch response was smooth, and we congratulated ourselves on a job well done.

However, a few days later, the client called us to inform us that the iPad home button had stopped working. We were surprised as we had checked and tested the iPad thoroughly after the screen replacement. We decided to investigate the issue and found out that home button failure after screen replacement is not uncommon in the iPad Mini 4 LTE.

The issue happens because the iPad's touch ID sensor is integrated with the home button, and it becomes unresponsive after replacing the screen. The home button itself works fine, but the touch ID sensor will no longer work, leaving the user unable to unlock the iPad using the fingerprint scanner.

The problem is often caused by damage to the touch ID sensor cable during the screen replacement. The cable is fragile and can be easily damaged during the replacement process, which leads to home button failure.

In our case, we had to replace the touch ID sensor cable and align it correctly for the home button to work correctly. It was a tedious process, but we managed to fix the issue, and the client was once again satisfied with our services.

Conclusion:

Replacing an iPad Mini 4 LTE screen is necessary when it's damaged, but it may come with a potential headache. Home button failure is a common issue when replacing the screen, particularly if the touch ID sensor cable is damaged during the replacement process.

If you're looking to replace your iPad Mini 4 LTE screen, make sure you seek the services of a professional repair technician who understands the tablet's complexities. The resulting cost of fixing a botched screen replacement job may be more than necessary, and it's best to avoid it altogether.

In summary, while it is possible to repair a broken iPad Mini 4 LTE screen, it's vital to proceed knowing that problems may arise, particularly when it comes to the touch ID sensor cable. With the right expertise and attention to detail, however, you can still enjoy a working and functional iPad after a successful screen replacement.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the new screen of iPad Mini 4 with same original home button. But Home button does not work. Does it requires any microsoldering to home button work with new screen ?

 As long as the button wasnâ€™t damaged and it was seated in the connector properly, it does not require micro soldering.
