Title: You Won't Believe the Accidental Spill Inside this Storage Reservoir of the McCulloch MC 1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner! See What Happens Next!

Are you looking for a durable cleaning device that can help you get rid of stubborn dirt and grime in your home or office? The McCulloch MC 1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner is a popular choice among homeowners and professional cleaners. This heavy-duty cleaner is designed to tackle tough cleaning chores using the power of steam.

However, what happens when you accidentally spill something inside the storage reservoir of this cleaning device? Will it still work the same way or will it be damaged beyond repair? Let's find out!

The McCulloch MC 1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner features a large water tank that can hold up to 48 ounces of water. This is enough to provide you with 45 minutes of continuous steam cleaning without the need for refilling. The tank is also removable for easy filling and cleaning.

But what if you accidentally spill something inside the reservoir? Whether it's soap, detergent, or any other cleaning solution, you might be worried that it will affect the performance of the steam cleaner. The good news is that the McCulloch MC 1275 is designed to handle such mishaps.

If you accidentally spill something inside the water tank, there's no need to panic. Simply empty the tank and flush it with clean water. Refill the tank with water and let the steam cleaner run for a few minutes to remove any residue. The steam cleaner should be back to its optimal performance in no time.

However, it's important to note that the McCulloch MC 1275 is designed to work with water only. Adding cleaning solutions or chemicals to the water tank can damage the internal components of the steam cleaner. This can also void your warranty, so it's best to stick to water when using this device.

In conclusion, the McCulloch MC 1275 Heavy Duty Steam Cleaner is a reliable and durable cleaning device that can handle accidental spills inside the water reservoir. However, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions and avoid adding chemical solutions to the water tank to ensure the longevity of the device. With proper use and maintenance, the McCulloch MC 1275 can last for many years and provide you with effective cleaning results.


## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I need some guidance. I was filling the tank but I dropped the funnel and spilled water outside the water compartment and into the storage compartment. Water started to pour out from the sides of the unit and from the bottom. I haven’t turned the unit on since I don’t know if I should wait to that water to dry. What should I do? Please advise!!

 honestly…. if it spilled in there and you didnt have it plugged in i would try and flip the unit on its side and get as much of the water out just with gravity. once youve done that either you can take a hair dryer and let it run for a little bit (be sure to not melt the plastic if there is any on the unit) or just let it sit for a day or so and dry out.
