## Chosen Solution
 I just replaced the screen and home button. When I powered the iPad back on, the home button worked, but it had to be pressed rather hard in order to work. The button isn't squishy at all, whereas it  doesn't press down hardly at all. I opened it back up to try to realign it, with no luck so far.
Keep trying to realign it or is there something I should know?
(BTW, I'm a high schooler and this is a project, so I'm a little on the novice side!)
(Just a little...)

 Hi Sarahhukill,
With the iPad 2 the home button, as you know is adhered to the back of the screen and pressing on the 2 contacts on the Dock port.
I would check the home button itself by holding it on the dock port contact and seeing if it activates properly when pressed (if it still needs to be pressed harder) it maybe that there is a fault with the Home Button and it needs replacing.
Also I would check the adhesive is properly keeping it in place and it is aligned correctly as this might be causing you to need to press the button further to create the contact.
