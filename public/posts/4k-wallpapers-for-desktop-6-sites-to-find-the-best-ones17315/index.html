This subreddit is home to a large community of wallpaper enthusiasts who share their favorite finds, as well as their own creations.\nBut before you start downloading your favorite wallpapers, make sure your desktop can handle the resolution. 4K wallpapers require a significantly higher resolution than standard wallpapers, so it’s important to ensure your monitor can handle it.\nWith these top 6 sites for stunning 4K wallpapers, you’re sure to find something that will revamp your desktop and brighten up your workspace. Happy wallpaper hunting!\nPreviously, we covered the best sites to discover aesthetic wallpapers for your desktop background and today we’re going to cover the best sites to find awesome looking 4K wallpapers for those who have ultra high-definition monitors.\nIf you read our previous article on what kind of setups our writers have for their home-based offices, you’ll notice that a lot of us are using widescreen monitors for our work. I personally am using the new Pro XDR display and it’s not worth looking at unless you have a 4K or higher resolution wallpaper on it.\nBest Sites To Find 4k Wallpaper Desktop Options InterfaceLIFTWallhavenSimple DesktopsHDwallpapersWallpaperStockDeviant Art InterfaceLIFT InterfaceLIFT offers stunning wallpaper for widescreen and double-screen computers, but also for mobile devices (Android and iPhone). There are thousands of great 4K wallpapers for desktop here that you can get by clicking the Download button next to the one you want, and get a copy of the wallpaper, along with details about the image.\nThe site also detects your display resolution automatically and shows you high-quality wallpapers matching that particular size. They’re sorted by date, but you can click the Sort by line and sort them randomly, by rating and number of downloads.\nInterfaceLIFT isn’t a new site though; it’s been offering beautiful wallpapers for a long time, and has a large online community of people who make system themes, icon packs and more.\nIts main drawbacks is the ads that make the site look busy, drawing your attention away from the wallpaper images, and the drop-down menu may be confusing when you use it for the first time.\nWallhaven Initially, Wallhaven was a project to improve or replace the now defunct Wallbase, and is popular as it offers high resolution wallpapers that are 1080p or above. To use this site, browse the homepage or use the top list, random and latest buttons to find a wallpaper you like.\nIt’s easy to find wallpapers similar to what you’re looking for thanks to the Tags or Search for similar options. This way, you get to view comparable images, and even select images based on a color you want and search by that variable.\nWhen you’re done, you can choose the Crop \u0026 Scale feature under the Tools section to crop and resize the wallpaper, and then download it in a different resolution.\nThe site has a massive community, large database, and infinity scroll that lets you view as many wallpapers as you want instead of clicking through several pages to see more options.\nIts wallpapers are unique and stunning, and there’s so much to choose from including abstract wallpapers, in portrait or landscape sizing, as well as different resolutions for multiple monitors.\nSimple Desktops As evidenced by the name, this site offers simple 4K wallpapers for desktop with minimal and clean designs, unlike the cluttered offerings on other sites. They’re appealing to the eye, and it’s easy to browse and click on the wallpaper you want, and save to your computer.\nIt’s free to use, doesn’t have irritating ads and other clutter, and offers high-resolution wallpapers, which you can also crop to fit smaller displays.\nThe wallpapers include text snippets, patterns or iconographic images, which look attractive without being distracting or busy. It’s ideal if you want your desktop to look beautiful without standing out too much or becoming a distraction to you while you work.\nThere are options for mobile devices, plus a Mac desktop app, and each image has some information about the artist who made it too.\nHDwallpapers This site offers high-definition photos, illustrations and other wallpapers every day, which you can sort by latest, featured, popular, or browse based on color or category.\nWhen you’re ready to download, you can select your computer resolution or mobile device, or a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter cover photo.\nIt also lets you pick from Available Resolutions on the wallpaper’s download page if you don’t want to download in your native resolution. However, it makes you wait for 10 seconds before the wallpaper is downloaded, so if you’re looking to download multiple wallpapers, it may slow you down.\nHowever, there are many HD wallpapers you can pick from for a variety of subjects, which work for double or triple screen displays.\nThe site is free to use and offers lots of 4K, HD and 8K images, but it’s ad-heavy so you may not enjoy a clutter-free experience as with Simple Desktop.\nWallpaperStock This site offers a huge amount of 4K wallpapers for desktop or any other purpose. You can check for categories such as animals, cars, world, and more, and select the resolution you want, though you can still see the resolution when you open the wallpaper’s page.\nThe site also detects the display resolution for your desktop device, which makes it easy for you to click and open the wallpaper in the size you want, and then save to your computer.\nThere’s a huge volume of high-quality, 4K wallpapers for your desktop computer in any category you want, plus it’s easy to navigate through the site and find what you want for free. Once you pick the wallpaper you want, you can download it for a specific screen resolution, mobile device or social media platform.\nIt’s a free to use site so you’ll have to make do with the ads, which can be distracting, but there are thousands of free wallpapers that are worth a look. You can also subscribe to RSS updates for wallpaper categories you want, and if you enter your email, you’ll get the week’s top 10 wallpapers delivered straight to your inbox.\nDeviant Art DeviantArt offers thousands of original artwork that are hand-painted, hand-drawn, photo-edited or computer-painted by amateur artists and other members.\nYou may not be able to use the search function to check for wallpapers as with other sites because its interface isn’t structured to find the wallpapers. You’ll find artwork that suits your personal preferences though, which you can add to your computer as your desktop wallpaper.\nIt also offers an optional paid membership service for more community features and faster browsing, besides a huge collection of wallpapers from illustrations, photos to fantasy, abstract digital art or fanart of your favorite game, movie or comic franchise.\nYou can pick wallpaper from a category, or sort from the most popular or latest wallpapers.\nHowever, it doesn’t let you filter specifically for display size or screen resolution so it may be a challenge finding exactly what you want. Plus, not all artwork on the site is free, and each wallpaper is only available in one size.\nWhat sites do you get your 4K wallpapers for desktop from?
