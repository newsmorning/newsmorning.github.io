# Get Ready to be Amazed: Discover the Secret Charging Contacts on the iRobot Roomba 960 - Your Vacuuming Game Will Never be the Same!

Are you getting tired of managing those tangled cords and limited range of your typical vacuum cleaner? Look no further, as the iRobot Roomba 960 is here to revolutionize your cleaning experience. With its advanced features and impressive technology, this robot vacuum can significantly reduce the time and effort you spend on cleaning your home. And with its secret charging contacts, your cleaning game will never be the same.

## What are Charging Contacts, and How do They Work?

In the case of the iRobot Roomba 960, Charging Contacts are two small metal fixtures located at the bottom of the robot vacuum. These contacts serve as a charging port that connects the Roomba 960 to its charging station. When the robot vacuum is running low on battery power, it will automatically navigate back to its docking station to recharge itself. The charging contacts allow the Roomba to dock precisely and replenish its charge with minimal fuss and high accuracy.

## Why are Charging Contacts Advantageous for Your Cleaning Needs?

One of the most significant advantages of having Charging Contacts in your robot vacuum is the ease and convenience of the charging process. Unlike the traditional vacuum cleaner that requires you to fumble with cords and hassle with plugs, the Roomba 960 can dock and recharge itself without your intervention. You don't have to worry about the charging time or keeping track of the machine, allowing you to save time and focus on other essential tasks.

Moreover, the Charging Contacts on the Roomba 960 can enhance its efficiency and performance in several ways. The contacts ensure that the robot vacuum always maintains full power, allowing it to operate for long hours and cover large areas without interruption. The charging process also prevents the Roomba from getting stuck or lost, as it can always recharge itself and resume the cleaning process.

## How to Ensure Your Roomba Maintains Its Charging Contacts?

To ensure that your Roomba 960 maintains its charging contacts and maximizes its cleaning potential, there are several things you can do. First, make sure that the robot vacuum is always connected to its docking station when not in use. This way, the Roomba can recharge itself and be ready for the next cleaning session.

Second, ensure that the charging contacts are clean and free of debris or dust. Dirt or other residues can affect the charging process and reduce the Roomba's overall performance. You can use a soft cloth or brush to clean the contacts regularly and ensure that they remain in top condition.

Lastly, be sure to check the charging status of your Roomba 960 regularly. The Roomba app can provide you with up-to-date information on the charging process, battery status, and cleaning progress, allowing you to monitor and manage your robot vacuum more efficiently.

In conclusion, the Charging Contacts on the iRobot Roomba 960 are a game-changer for your cleaning needs. With their superior technology and ease of use, they can significantly enhance your cleaning experience, providing you with a smarter, more efficient way of keeping your home clean and tidy. So, get ready to be amazed and discover the secret charging contacts on your Roomba 960 – your vacuuming game will never be the same!

## Chosen Solution
 I need to repair my Roomba. How can I remove the charging contacts from the body?

 Same problem here with my Roomba 880. I ordered replacement charging contacts at Ebay for 6 euro’s. My Roomba makes a ‘ticking’ sound when charging.  Installing the replacement contacts could be difficult as these have to be installed under the main print. I’ll let you know if i managed to replace them!
