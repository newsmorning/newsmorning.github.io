Title: Unlock the World of Anime: Discover 5 Effortless Ways to Access Crunchyroll from Anywhere Outside the US!

Introduction:

Anime is a popular genre of animation with its roots in Japan. Over the years, it has gained immense popularity worldwide, thanks to the creation of platforms like Crunchyroll. However, accessing Crunchyroll outside the US has been an uphill task. As an anime enthusiast, trying to access Crunchyroll from a country outside the US means restricted access to some anime titles, and that can be frustrating. This article will explore five effortless ways to access Crunchyroll from anywhere outside the US.

1. Using a VPN:

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an effective and efficient way to access Crunchyroll from outside the USA. A VPN will give you a new IP address that will trick websites like Crunchyroll to think you're accessing it from the US. There are many reliable VPN providers to choose from, such as CyberGhost, NordVPN, and ExpressVPN, among others.

2. SmartDNS:

SmartDNS is another method of accessing Crunchyroll from outside the USA. SmartDNS works by routing the DNS requests through a proxy server, masking your location and giving you access to Crunchyroll's content. Services like Unlocator, Smart DNS Proxy, or OverPlay offer SmartDNS subscriptions making it easy to access Crunchyroll from anywhere outside the US.

3. Proxies:

Proxies work differently from VPNs or SmartDNS. A proxy server will reroute your internet traffic through a US-based server, and you'll be able to access Crunchyroll's geo-restricted content. Free proxy servers, however, can be unreliable and not secure. You can consider paid proxy services like Smartproxy or Luminati to access Crunchyroll with the least downtime.

4. Tor:

Tor is a popular open-source browser that will help you access Crunchyroll outside the USA. The browser's built-in encryption and server connection make it highly secure when accessing Crunchyroll. However, Tor is significantly slower than other methods of accessing Crunchyroll, making it a less desirable option.

5. Crunchyroll Guest Passes:

Crunchyroll Guest Pass gives temporary access to Crunchyroll's premium content to non-subscribers. These passes last for 48 hours, and they allow access to Crunchyroll's premium content. You can obtain a guest pass by asking your friends or anime communities for one.

Conclusion:

Accessing Crunchyroll from outside the USA doesn't have to be a challenging task anymore. With the five easy methods outlined in this article, you can now enjoy seamless access to Crunchyroll's content, regardless of your location. You can choose from a VPN, SmartDNS, proxies, Tor, or Crunchyroll Guest Passes, depending on your preferences. However, VPNs and SmartDNS remain the most practical and convenient methods of accessing Crunchyroll's content outside the US.

Crunchyroll, like many other streaming services, uses a technology called geo-blocking to block certain content based on the country you log in from.  This can be due to licensing agreements, country restrictions, or oftentimes is purely market driven. So, how can you watch Crunchyroll outside the US?
 
Streaming content on services like Crunchyroll shouldn’t be a hassle, and it doesn’t have to be.  By reading through these techniques and know-how, you can discover how to watch the normal US Crunchyroll content with ease and in the way that works best for you.
 
## Check the Listings in Your Country
 
If you created your account and normally use it in one country and then try to use it while visiting a country, there may be nothing to do but log in to your Crunchyroll account. Some countries experience less geo-blocking of Crunchyroll content.
 
Depending on the country you log in from, the anime episode or manga you’re looking for may be available. The easiest way to find out is to log in and search!
 
## Use a Proxy Browser Extension
 
If your favorite anime isn’t available in your country due to licensing, a proxy browser extension could help you bypass such problems.
 
Look for an extension that is made by a trusted software, and encrypts your data.  Some proxy extensions however, have been blocked by Crunchyroll so if the first one you try doesn’t work you can try another.
 
These types of browser extensions are very easy to use.  To use a proxy browser extension, you should:
 
- Install the extension for your favorite browserChoose from what location you want your proxy server to be. If the extension gives you more than one location in the US, choose the closest one to get the fastest connection.Log in to your Crunchyroll account and choose from all the US Content.

 
You must be careful using these browser extensions however.  There are many options out there, and a lot of them are not safe to use.  They have poor security, and some even secretly share your private information!
 
## Use Smart DNS
 
If the idea of proxy browser extensions have you worried about security, or if you haven’t found a browser extension that works, then Smart DNS could be the solution.
 
Smart DNS will only affect your Crunchyroll content.  It doesn’t reroute all Internet traffic.  This service is extremely safe and easy to use.  To use this specialized service:
 
- Find the Smart DNS service you want to useSign up for itFollow the instructions to configure it on your computer or mobile deviceChoose the Crunchyroll channel or app to allow you access to US Crunchyroll content

 
Smart DNS Proxy is a particularly easy version to use as it also gives you step-by-step directions and a video to show you how to set it up.  Once Smart DNS is properly configured, you should now be able to access the entire library of Crunchyroll anime and manga.
 
## Use a VPN Service
 
If you want a service that will provide you with ways to watch your Crunchyroll content, while not sacrificing security and at the same time having a range of price points: from the big spender to the broke college student, a VPN service would be the best decision. 
 
A VPN Service is perhaps the most common way of bypassing Crunchyroll’s geo-restrictions.  This service will connect you to a different server that will handle all the internet traffic.  This means that you can have a US server give you US Crunchyroll content no matter where you are in the world.
 
VPN services are very easy to set up.  Some of them are free, so you don’t even need to enter any credit card information.  Simply choose the VPN service you want, sign up for it and follow their instructions.  Most VPN services have very detailed and broken down instructions to guide you through the process. 
 
Nearly all VPN services can be used on a vast amount of Internet connected devices, such as:
 
- ComputersMobile DevicesSmart TVs

 
To make watching your content even easier, choose the US VPN server that is closest to you to get the best connection.
 
## Buy a VPN Router
 
Even though VPN routers are a large investment, they can be a great way to access Crunchyroll content if you are staying in another country for a long period of time or expatriating completely.
 
VPN Routers take the idea of a VPN service and package it into a router.  Many VPN services promote, and even sell such routers.  These routers are extremely secure because, unlike a service running on a computer or mobile device, VPN routers use their hardware to connect to the VPN server.
 
Configuring the VPN for this kind of router is very easy as the manufacturer provides instructions, along with the VPN service you are using.
 
## Conclusion
 
No matter what country you are logging in from, there are easy ways to access Crunchyroll content.  If the anime you want to watch isn’t geo-blocked, it’s as easy as logging into Crunchyroll and watching.  However, if your favorite anime or manga is blocked, then there are easy options.
 
Finding your favorite anime or manga in another country can be frustrating and complicated, but it doesn’t have to be.
