You Won't Believe The Shocking Secret Behind Why Your iPhone 6S Home Button Doesn't Work - And This Simple Extension Cable Is The Solution!

Are you tired of your iPhone 6S home button not working? Believe it or not, there is a shocking secret behind why this happens â€“ and a simple solution you can use to fix it.

The issue lies within the design of the home button itself. Unlike previous iPhone models, the 6S home button is connected to the phone's logic board via a small extension cable. Over time, this cable can wear down and become damaged, causing the home button to stop functioning.

The good news is that there is a simple extension cable available that can help fix the issue. This cable is made of a high-quality, durable material and is designed to replace the damaged cable in your iPhone 6S. With just a few simple steps, you can have your home button working like new again.

To install the extension cable, all you need is a small toolkit and some basic technical knowledge. First, you will need to carefully remove the damaged cable from your iPhone 6S. Then, using the toolkit, you can install the new cable in its place. Once the cable is in place, your home button should start working again, just like it did when you first got your phone.

It's important to note that if you are not comfortable with technical repairs, it is best to seek professional assistance. Attempting to repair your phone on your own can lead to further damage and may even void your phone's warranty.

In conclusion, the shocking secret behind why your iPhone 6S home button doesn't work is a small extension cable that connects the button to the phone's logic board. By replacing this cable with a high-quality, durable replacement cable, you can fix your home button and get your phone working like new again. Just remember to proceed with caution and seek professional assistance if necessary.

## Chosen Solution
 Trying to replace a torn home button extension flex cable on an iphone 6s and can not find any online after extensive searching, short of just buying the digitizer replacement which obviously comes with one.  Any ideas where I can find one? I can only find them for the 6s plus and the 6. I am capable of replacing the cable myself as I was the one who tore the cable while replacing the rear facing camera. Thank you for the help.

 It's built into the 3D-Touch sensor/backlight panel. You have to replace them all, there is no "just home button" extension cable to begin with.

 I also have been looking 6s extension cable but i couldn't make it. So I ordered assembly today about $20.  I will tear it and put that cable from that out. Can not believe nobody sells that parts all around online market.
