You won't believe what happened when I replaced the screen digitizer and sleep/wake sensor on my iPad Mini 4 LTE!

As an avid tech enthusiast, I always love to get my hands dirty and tinker around with electronic devices. Recently, I got ahold of a faulty iPad Mini 4 LTE and immediately set to work on repairing it.

The problem with the iPad was pretty obvious â€“ the screen digitizer and sleep/wake sensor were both malfunctioning. The digitizer, which is responsible for sensing touch inputs, was completely unresponsive in certain areas of the screen. Meanwhile, the sleep/wake sensor, which is responsible for detecting when the iPad is opened or closed, was not working at all.

To fix these issues, I decided to replace both components myself. This was no easy task, as the iPad Mini 4 LTE is notorious for being one of Apple's most difficult products to repair. Nevertheless, armed with the proper tools and some online tutorials, I set out to tackle the job.

It took several hours of careful disassembly and reassembly, but in the end, I successfully replaced both the screen digitizer and sleep/wake sensor. I was ecstatic to see that the iPad was now fully functional again.

But that wasn't the most surprising part.

After turning on the iPad and testing out the new components, I immediately noticed a significant improvement in performance. The touchscreen was far more responsive and accurate than before, and the sleep/wake sensor was incredibly fast and reliable.

In fact, the iPad Mini 4 LTE now felt like a completely different device. It was smoother, more responsive, and overall much more enjoyable to use.

I couldn't believe just how much of a difference replacing the screen digitizer and sleep/wake sensor had made. It goes to show that sometimes, small and seemingly insignificant repairs can have a huge impact on the performance of electronic devices.

Overall, I learned a lot from this repair project, and I can't wait to tackle more challenging fixes in the future. If you're ever faced with a faulty electronic device, don't be afraid to take it apart and try to fix it yourself. You might just be surprised at what you can accomplish.

## Chosen Solution
 I'm about to replace my wife's iPad Mini 4 LTE's LCD/digitizer (fused). The guide says to remove the connector with 6 solder pads on it, the home button, and some posts talk about a component that affects the sleep/wake function of the iPad.
Appreciate any help with some concerns:
1.) The 6 pads that need to be desoldered and resoldered, is it better to release it with a heat gun or use a soldering iron and peel it slowly away?
2.) How do I know if the replacement screen/digitizer has the component needed for the sleep/wake function
3.) Should the replacement not have it, what does the component look like and how do we remove it? Soldering Iron? Heat Gun?
Thank you all! (m  _   _  m) (kneeling)

 You want to remove it using a soldering iron with a small hoof tip, at the lowest temperature your solder can handle. Using leaded solder here will make your job a lot easier. Pop a small amount of flux paste on the existing joints before desoldering, too.
I'd recommend against using a heat gun - the kind of heat needed to melt the solder would destroy the plastic flex - or desoldering wick/braid, for a similar reason.
It'd be pretty obvious if the new display assembly doesn't already have the sensor, as there will be an exposed copper pad array in that location, ready for a sensor to be soldered onto it.
This is what the part looks like:
