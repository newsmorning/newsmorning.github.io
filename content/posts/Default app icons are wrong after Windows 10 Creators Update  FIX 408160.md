# Are Your App Icons Broken Since the Windows 10 Creators Update? Here's How to Fix Them - It's Shockingly Simple!

If you're a Windows 10 user and you've recently updated to the Creators Update, you may have noticed that some of your app icons are broken. This can be frustrating, especially if you rely on these apps for work or play. But don't worry – there's a simple fix that you can use to get your icons back to their former glory.

## The Problem

The Creators Update introduces a new feature called App Installer, which is designed to make it easier to install and manage apps from the Windows Store. Unfortunately, this feature can sometimes cause problems with app icons, especially if you've manually pinned them to your Start menu or Taskbar.

When you install an app using App Installer, it creates a new shortcut on your Start menu or Taskbar. But if you've already pinned the app to these locations, the icon may not update properly, leaving you with a broken or missing icon.

## The Solution

The good news is that fixing this problem is surprisingly simple. Here's what you need to do:

1. Open the Start menu and search for the app that has a broken icon.
2. Right-click on the app and select "Unpin from Start" or "Unpin from Taskbar," depending on where the broken icon is located.
3. Open the Windows Store and search for the app.
4. Click on the app to open its page in the Windows Store.
5. Click the "Install" button to install the app using App Installer.
6. Once the app is installed, open the Start menu or Taskbar and locate the new shortcut. If the icon looks correct, you're all set!
7. If the icon is still broken, right-click on the shortcut and select "More > Open file location."
8. This will open the folder containing the app's executable file. Right-click on the executable file and select "Properties."
9. In the Properties dialog box, click the "Change Icon" button.
10. Select a new icon from the list or browse to a new icon file on your computer. Click "OK" to save your changes.
11. Close the Properties dialog box and return to the Start menu or Taskbar. The app icon should now be fixed!

## Conclusion

If you've experienced broken app icons since updating to the Windows 10 Creators Update, don't worry – you're not alone. But with this simple fix, you can get your icons back to their proper state in just a few easy steps. So don't let broken icons slow you down – take a few minutes to fix them today!

Many Windows 10 Creators Update users have reported that the default Windows 10 app icons are broken after the upgrade. More specifically, all apps feature the same image, as you can see in the image above.

Of course, this is not a major issue as all the apps are fully functional. However, some users may be annoyed by the fact that the default Windows 10 apps display wrong icons. It is worth mentioning that only Mail and Edge feature the right app icons.
 
Simply selecting the app again from the list won’t fix this problem. Fortunately, one resourceful user has come up with a solution to restore the right default app icons.
 
### Fix: Windows 10 default app icons are wrong
 
1. Go to Apps & features > search for every default app one at a time. They are Maps, Groove Music, Photos, and Films & TV.
 
2. Once you’ve located the app, click on Advanced options.
 

 
3. Select Reset and confirm.
 
This action may delete data stored on your computer. Keep in mind that the apps and live tiles may need to reconfigure themselves when you first launch them again.
 
The reset does affect the individual app settings. Don’t forget to reopen Maps and grant location access and set a default location in case you rely on those features. Also, check the Mail app to see if your account is still working.
 
It appears that this issue with the Windows 10 default app icons occurs only on computers that upgraded from the Anniversary Update OS to Windows 10 Creators Update. Insiders report that they haven’t encountered this problem.
 
Have you encountered this issue after upgrading to Windows 10 Creators Update? Did you upgrade from AU to CU or from an Insider build to CU?
 
I think this only happens on PC’s that were upgraded from AU to CU (without Insider builds in between). I used Insider builds and I don’t have this issue but when I upgraded my mothers PC from AU, it does have it.
