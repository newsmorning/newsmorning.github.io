Title: Unlock the Mysteries of Accounting: Shocking Truths Revealed in Debit vs Credit Showdown with Infographics!

Introduction:
Learning accounting can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. The terms, formulas, and process behind it can be challenging to understand. However, accounting is a crucial aspect of any business, big or small. It helps in making informed decisions and understanding the financial health of the business. In this article, we'll take a look at debit vs credit, two fundamental concepts of accounting, and uncover some shocking truths through the use of infographics.

What is Debit and Credit?
In accounting, debit and credit are two opposite entries that balance each other out. Debit entry is an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities or equity. Credit entry is a decrease in assets or an increase in liabilities or equity. It's important to remember that debit does not always mean a positive amount, and credit does not always mean a negative amount.

The Shocking Truths about Debit and Credit:
One of the biggest misconceptions about debit and credit is that they are interchangeable. However, that's not the case. Debit and credit have specific rules that need to be followed. One such rule is the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. For each transaction, the equation needs to balance out, meaning that debit and credit need to balance each other out as well.

Another shocking truth is that debit and credit do not always represent an inflow or outflow of cash. For example, if a business takes out a loan, the loan amount will be credited to the liabilities account, but there won't be an inflow of cash. Similarly, if a business makes a sale and receives payment at a later date, the revenue will be credited to the income account, but there won't be an inflow of cash.

Infographics: 
Infographics can be a great way to understand complex concepts easily. Here are some infographics depicting the relationship between debit and credit.
