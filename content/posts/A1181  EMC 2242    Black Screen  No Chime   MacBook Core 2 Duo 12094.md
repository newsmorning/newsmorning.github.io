# Shocking Macbook Failure: A1181 EMC 2242 goes BLACK SCREEN with no chime! Find out why!

When it comes to technology, there’s nothing quite as frustrating as a sudden failure. And that’s exactly what many owners of the A1181 EMC 2242 Macbook model have been experiencing – a black screen with no startup chime.

This has left many users feeling helpless and unsure of how to fix the problem. However, after extensive research and troubleshooting, we’ve compiled some possible explanations for the mysterious failure.

## Aging Hardware

One possibility for the black screen could simply be due to aging hardware. The A1181 EMC 2242 was released in 2007, meaning that it’s at least 14 years old at the time of writing. At this point, components like the motherboard, hard drive, and RAM could be failing due to wear and tear.

If this is the case, then the only solution may be to replace the faulty hardware. However, this can be a costly and time-consuming process, especially if the issue can’t be pinpointed quickly.

## Faulty Logic Board

Another potential culprit for the black screen is a faulty logic board. The logic board is responsible for controlling a Macbook’s various components, including the display.

If the logic board is failing, then it could be preventing the Macbook from booting up properly. Unfortunately, the only solution in this case would be to replace the logic board entirely, which could be expensive and difficult to find for an older model like the A1181 EMC 2242.

## Corrupted Operating System

Sometimes, the issue isn’t with the hardware at all, but instead with the software. If the Macbook’s operating system is corrupted, then it could prevent the computer from booting up properly.

To troubleshoot this possibility, users can try booting up their Macbook in Safe Mode by holding down the Shift key during startup. If the Macbook is able to start up in Safe Mode, then the issue is likely with the operating system.

In this case, users can try reinstalling the operating system or restoring from a backup. However, it’s important to note that this could result in data loss, so it’s important to back up important files beforehand.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, a black screen with no chime on an A1181 EMC 2242 Macbook can be a frustrating and confusing issue to deal with. While there are several potential causes for the failure, the solutions are often costly and time-consuming.

If you’re experiencing this issue with your Macbook, it’s recommended to seek out professional assistance to properly diagnose and fix the problem. With luck and the right expertise, you’ll be back to using your Macbook without any issues.

## Chosen Solution
 I have recently acquired a MacBook Core 2 Duo (Model A1181 - EMC 2242) from a friend, on the basis that "if I can fix it, I can keep it or sell it".
This thing has beaten me, to the point where I don't particularly care if I sell it or make use of it - I just want to see it working again out of defiance.
When connecting to the power adapter, the MagSafe light is green. The removable battery appears to charge, and work as normal.
After pressing the power button, the screen may flicker briefly once and then stays solid black with no backlight. The indicator light on the front of the machine stays solid white. There appears to be some mechanical noise from inside the machine.
There is no Apple chime, and the machine does not boot.
The CD drive will not accept, or eject any media.
I have tried connecting to an external display, with no result.
The side USB ports, however, will power peripherals that are connected to it.
I have tried all the tips I can find, including SMC reset, PRAM reset, etc etc, and have tried reseating RAM chips (including trying to see if either one of the RAM ports is faulty by only leaving a single RAM chip in place, and then swapping them over). I've also tried using different RAM chips.
I have stripped the machine down, as per the iFixit guide, and cannot see any obvious faults, or liquid damage.
Currently, all signs point to a faulty logic board... but before I decide to accept defeat and ditch this thing... does anyone have any other possible solutions?

 A multimeter will do you some good, you could check test points and see where the power issue is, do you at least hear the fans spinning when you power it on?
