Title: Warning! Is Your Macbook Pro 13 Touch Bar Late 2016 Struggling with Mysterious Lines Across the Screen?

If you own a Macbook Pro 13 Touch Bar Late 2016 model, you might have noticed a strange phenomenon of mysterious lines appearing on the screen. Don't panic yet, as you're not alone, and there's a solution to this problem.

Before we dive into the solution, let's understand the root cause of this problem. The culprit here is the display flex cable that connects the display to the logic board inside the device. Over time or due to excessive use, the cable gets worn out, leading to a faulty connection that causes the screen to display strange lines or flickering.

If you're experiencing this problem, you're not alone. Many Macbook Pro 13 Touch Bar Late 2016 users have reported similar issues across various online forums. The problem generally occurs after around two years of usage, which is beyond the warranty period for most users.

But don't worry, as there's a fix available for this issue. The first and foremost solution is to take your device to an authorized Apple service center. They will replace the affected display flex cable with a new one, resolving the issue once and for all.

However, if your device is out of warranty, this fix may cost you a pretty penny, and not everyone might be willing to pay for it. Fret not, as there's a second option available that is both cheap and easy.

You can purchase a replacement display flex cable online and try replacing it yourself. You can easily find a reliable and affordable replacement display flex cable on websites like Amazon or eBay. There are also plenty of tutorials and videos available online that can help you carry out the process step-by-step.

However, it's essential to note that self-repairing your device might result in other issues that can further damage your device. If you're not confident about your technical skills, it's better to leave the repair job to the experts.

In conclusion, If you own a Macbook Pro 13 Touch Bar Late 2016 model, and you're experiencing mysterious lines on the screen, don't worry, as there's a solution available. You can either take your device to an authorized Apple service center or purchase a replacement display flex cable online and try repairing it yourself.

## Chosen Solution
 Theres a problem which started yestersay where there were lines at the bottom of on Macbook's screen. It forms like bottom of the screen of when it start. (If you don't understand you can look at the image) It also fades a little when I don't use it. (Like in the image) The mouse is still slightly visible when its moved toward the glitched area. The lines also flicker very slightly.

I think the cause of this was the Macbook overheated and brunt some display cable in the device. I have been using it for very, very long. It was also making air rushing noises.
If you could see whats going on and suggest a way to fix it I would be very grateful. Thanks!

 Youâ€™er not alone!
