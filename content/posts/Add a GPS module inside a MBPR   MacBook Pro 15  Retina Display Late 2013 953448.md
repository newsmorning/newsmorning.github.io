# You Won't Believe How Adding a GPS Module Inside Your MBPR MacBook Pro 15 Retina Display Late 2013 Will Revolutionize Your Navigation!

Are you tired of getting lost while traveling or looking for directions? Do you wish you had a reliable navigation system that could guide you through unfamiliar terrains and geographies? Well, you're in luck because the solution is closer than you think. In fact, it's inside your MacBook Pro 15 Retina Display Late 2013, and it's called a GPS module.

GPS (Global Positioning System) is a network of satellites that orbit Earth and transmit signals to GPS receivers on the ground. By determining the distance between the receiver and the satellites, GPS can accurately pinpoint the receiver's location on Earth. This technology has revolutionized the way we navigate and travel, making it easier and more convenient than ever before.

To take advantage of this technology, you can add a GPS module to your MacBook Pro 15 Retina Display Late 2013. This small device plugs into your computer's USB port and provides it with GPS functionality. With a GPS-enabled MacBook Pro, you can:

## Navigate with Confidence

Do you ever feel anxious about driving in a new city or going on a long road trip alone? With a GPS-enabled MacBook Pro, you can navigate with confidence and ease. The device will show you the most efficient and safest route to your destination, highlight any obstacles or delays along the way, and alert you to upcoming turns and intersections. Not only does this make your travel less stressful, but it also saves you time and energy by avoiding unnecessary detours or delays.

## Explore New Places

Want to explore new places and attractions but don't know your way around? With a GPS-enabled MacBook Pro, you can easily discover new cities, towns, and landmarks with just a few clicks. The device will show you the nearest points of interest, provide you with directions to get there, and even recommend other popular destinations along the way. This makes your travel more adventurous, exciting, and memorable.

## Track Your Fitness

Are you a fitness enthusiast who loves to track your workouts and progress? With a GPS-enabled MacBook Pro, you can monitor your fitness activities in real-time. The device can track your running routes, measure your speed and distance, and even calculate your calories burned. This makes your fitness routine more measurable, motivating, and effective.

## Manage Your Business

Are you a business owner who needs to manage a fleet of vehicles or assets? With a GPS-enabled MacBook Pro, you can keep track of your vehicles and assets in real-time. The device can show you their exact location, speed, and direction, as well as their status and performance. This makes your business more efficient, productive, and profitable.

## Conclusion

Adding a GPS module to your MacBook Pro 15 Retina Display Late 2013 is a game-changer for your navigation, travel, fitness, and business. It's a small investment that pays off in a big way by making your life easier, safer, and more productive. So, why wait? Get a GPS-enabled MacBook Pro today and experience the benefits of this amazing technology firsthand. You won't believe how much it will revolutionize your navigation!

## Chosen Solution
 The space left inside a MBP is scarce but I believe that a tiny GPS module could fit inside. Does anyone know how it could be powered from the motherboard? The purpose would be to track back a stolen device...

Unless you modify the EFI, I believe that the Find My Mac is useless if the thief has some informatics skills. And most of the 'Tiles' I am aware of are Bluetooth trackers with limited range of detection. That's why I believe that a hidden GPS module embedded in the computer and powered by its battery would be an efficient solution, provided that, of course, the case is not an obstacle to the signal transmission...

 If you can't set it up with iCloud and "Find My Mac", you can insert what is called a Tile to track it:

 I highly doubt there is a way to add a GPS module to a MacBook.  If you are worrying about tracking a stolen device, Find My Mac through iCloud works fine.

 I think this is a better option: Anti-Theft Solution

 You may have to find solder points on the logic board that gives the correct voltage to your tracker. It may be 3.3v or 5v. I don’t think you’ll find much info so I recommend looking at schematics (if you know how to read them) or use a multimeter to look for points that will give the correct voltage. Try to use points that are closely related to ac and battery power since I believe those are the best to draw additional current out of. Drawing current from points that lead to other components like the backlight, cpu, etc. may make the board malfunction. I don’t know anything about this on MBPs, I’m speaking from adding 12v led’s and 3.3v/5v glitch boards on Xbox 360s. Which is not the same as you’re trying to do.

 I’d love to do this. How about the camera? I never use mine as it is a POS. Double check first, but the camera wire runs from the motherboard and is a modified USB connection with GND, 2 USB data lines, and a 5V power line. Snip it, reroute the tiny cable to somewhere it will fit and hope that it registers as a USB device :-)

Apple cameras (“iSight”, or more recently “FaceTime”, embedded cameras) have been USB based for a number of generations of MacBook, since at least 2006.  Similar to normal USB, the camera connector traditionally contains 5V, GND, and two USB data lines
