# Stop Swiping Left! 5 Foolproof Fixes for OkCupid's General Authentication Error You Must Try Now

Are you tired of seeing the dreaded "General authentication error" message on OkCupid? It's a frustrating experience that can ruin your online dating experience. But don't worry, we've got you covered with these foolproof fixes that you must try now.

## 1. Clear Your Cache and Cookies

One of the simplest and most effective fixes for the general authentication error on OkCupid is to clear your cache and cookies. These are temporary files that your browser stores, which can sometimes cause authentication issues. To clear them, go to your browser's settings and click on the "Clear browsing data" option. Make sure you select the "Cookies and other site data" option and the "Cached images and files" option. Then click on "Clear data" and try logging into OkCupid again.

## 2. Disable Your Ad Blocker

Ad blockers can sometimes cause issues with OkCupid's authentication process. If you have an ad blocker enabled, try disabling it and then try logging in again. This should resolve any authentication issues caused by ad blockers.

## 3. Use a Different Browser

Another simple fix is to try using a different browser to access OkCupid. Sometimes, certain browsers may not be compatible with OkCupid's authentication process, which can cause issues. Try using a different browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, and see if you can log in without any issues.

## 4. Reset Your Password

If none of the above fixes work, you may need to reset your password. Go to OkCupid's login page and click on the "Forgot password?" link. Then follow the prompts to reset your password. Once you've reset your password, try logging in again and see if the authentication error is resolved.

## 5. Contact OkCupid Support

If you've tried all of the above fixes and you're still seeing the general authentication error on OkCupid, then you may need to contact OkCupid support. They can help you troubleshoot the issue and provide a resolution. You can contact OkCupid support by clicking on the "Help" button on the bottom of the OkCupid login page.

## Why does OkCupid show a general authentication error?
 
OkCupid is an excellent platform to find the one you are looking for or simply a mate for your lonely life. However, the app throws a fair share of bugs and glitches that hamper a smooth user experience.
 
For some OkCupid users, this problem shows up when they try to log in to the platform. The app loads after entering their credentials and shows a general authentication error.
 
However, when you try to send a message, you will come across a general authentication error message. If it sounds tricky, worry no more as the below solutions should help you fix it.
 
## How can I fix OkCupid’s general authentication error?
 
### 1. Restart your device
 
#### ➡ Smartphone
 
- Press the Power button.
 - Select Restart.
 - After waiting for 10 seconds, power on your phone.

 
#### ➡ PC
 
- Open the Start menu.
 - Click on the Power button.
 - Select Restart from the pop-up menu.

 
Restarting your device will load up all the essential system files required for the device to work correctly from scratch, which might have been missed during the previous session.
 
### 2. Check if your account is banned
 
If you violated OkCupid policies and conditions, your account would be banned without prior notice.
 
Since OkCupid deals with a lot of personal information and allows you to showcase yourself and interact with others, there are some strict guidelines in place.
 
Note that Okcupid actually bans your IP address. If you want to get back to using it, you just have to access it with a different IP, and the simplest way to do that is with a VPN.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.
 
Expert tip:

We suggest you use Opera’s built-in VPN feature because it is free and has no data limits. It’s right before the address bar, enable it and try to connect again. It will mask your actual IP and thus remove the ban.
 
If you are able to connect, it is very possible that you have been banned. You can continue using Opera’s VPN, but if you think this is a mistake on their part, contact the customer support team.
 
⇒ Get Opera
 
### 3. Update the app
 
- Open Play Store.
 - Tap on your Profile icon.
