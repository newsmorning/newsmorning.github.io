If you are a proud owner of an iPhone 5, you may have noticed strange lines and splotches on your screen. Before you panic and think the worst, we're here to tell you that it's not always a hardware issue. In fact, it could be something as simple as a software issue, or even something as mundane as a dirt or grime buildup on your screen. So, don't jump the gun and call the Apple store just yet, read on to learn more about what's causing these strange lines and splotches and how you can fix it.

**Hardware Damage:**

One of the most common reasons for lines and splotches on your iPhone 5 screen is hardware damage. A damaged screen, water damage, or impact can all cause these lines and splotches to appear. If you suspect any hardware damage, it's best to take your phone to a certified technician to have it repaired. Attempting to fix the damage at home may cause further damage to your device.

**Software Issues:**

Software issues are another reason lines and splotches may appear on your iPhone 5 screen. Outdated or corrupted software, or an app that is not compatible with your phone can cause strange lines and splotches to appear. In this case, the solution is relatively simple. All you need to do is either update your software or delete the incompatible app and reinstall it after updating your phone.

**Dirt and Grime on Your Screen:**

If your iPhone screen isn't properly cleaned, it can cause lines and splotches to appear. Everyday use of the phone can cause an accumulation of dirt and grime that appear as lines or splotches. The solution is as simple as giving your phone screen a thorough cleaning with a soft cloth and a cleaning solution.

**What to Do Next:**

If you are experiencing strange lines and splotches on your iPhone 5 screen, you should begin by ruling out any hardware damage. If that's not the issue, then move on to checking for software issues or dirt and grime buildup on your phone screen. Once you have identified the root cause, take the necessary action to fix it.

In conclusion, strange lines and splotches on your iPhone 5 screen can be caused by many different things. Sometimes it's a straightforward hardware issue that needs professional attention, while other times, it's a software issue or dirt and grime buildup. Either way, it's important to take care of your phone and address the issue before it's too late.

## Chosen Solution
 I ATTEMPTED to replace my cracked screen, glass only, and thought I did a terrific job! Until I put back the cables and turned it on. Crap. There are thick and thin vertical lines, blue, green, red.... and random black splotches, that looks as if I spilled ink on my screen, I really do not want to spend $120 getting it fixed,my dad wouldn't like spending so much on my phone. Our phone bill is enough. Do I check the cables? Missing screws? Dust the inside? I'm almost certain it's an LCD issue though..

 Helen, " that looks as if I spilled ink on my screen" sure sounds like a broken LCD. That is the problem with glass only repairs. Unless one has the right tools and plenty of practice it's an mishap waiting to happen. To fix it I'd suggest that you replace the complete display assembly. Here is the guide for it and the part is available right here as well as many other places. You may find it of lesser quality but cheaper at other places.
