# You Won't Believe What We Found Inside This Brother Printer - Shocking Streaks on the Scanner Glass!

When it comes to office equipment, many people don't give much thought to printers. They simply assume that they do their job and that's all there is to it. However, as we recently discovered, there can be some surprising things lurking inside a printer.

We were recently called in to repair a Brother printer that was experiencing some performance issues. Initially, we thought it was just a simple mechanical problem, but when we took a closer look, we were shocked to discover what was really going on.

As soon as we opened up the printer's scanner cover, we noticed streaks on the scanner glass. These streaks were unlike anything we had ever seen before - they were long, thin, and almost seemed to be etched into the glass itself.

After removing the scanner glass from the printer and taking a closer look, we discovered what was causing these strange streaks. Believe it or not, it was actually ink that had somehow gotten inside the scanner assembly and was being spread around on the glass.

But how could ink get inside the scanner assembly? As it turned out, the printer's owner had been using non-genuine ink cartridges that were prone to leakage. Over time, ink had leaked out of the cartridges and found its way into the scanner assembly.

This ink had then been spread around as the scanner head moved back and forth during scanning. Eventually, it had built up to the point where it was creating visible streaks on the scanner glass.

Removing the ink from the scanner glass was a painstaking process that required a lot of time and effort. We had to disassemble the scanner assembly completely and clean it very carefully to avoid further damage.

In the end, we were able to remove all of the ink from the scanner glass and reassemble the printer. Once we were done, the printer worked as good as new and the streaks on the scanner glass were gone.

So what can we learn from this experience? First and foremost, always use genuine ink cartridges for your printer. Not only will they give you better print quality, but they will also help prevent issues like the one we encountered.

Secondly, don't neglect your printer's maintenance. Regular cleaning and upkeep can help prevent issues from occurring and prolong the life of your printer.

Finally, if you do encounter issues with your printer, don't hesitate to call in a professional. Trying to fix the problem yourself can often make things worse and end up costing you more in the long run.

In conclusion, our encounter with this Brother printer was a shocking reminder of just how important it is to take care of your office equipment. By following these tips, you can help ensure that your printer stays in good working order and avoid any unexpected surprises down the line.

## Chosen Solution
 Looks like moisture leaked in. Scans all have vertical streaks. I can see this on inside of glass but I can’t get to it to clean it. Need to disassemble.

 Hi,
Here’s a link to the service manual for the printer.
On p.3-66 it shows the removal of the scanner unit.
Maybe doing this will allow access to the underside of the scanner glass or even to be able to remove the glass if necessary.
