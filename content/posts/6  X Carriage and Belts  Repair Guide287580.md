# Revamp Your 3D Printer with These Genius Fixes for Carriage and Belts!

If you're an avid 3D printer user, you know that printer maintenance is as important as utilizing the printing features. One of the most common issues that hinder the smooth operation of 3D printers is the carriage and belt. In this article, we will walk you through some smart solutions that will help you revamp your 3D printer with just a few tweaks. 

## The Carriage 

The carriage is an essential part of the 3D printer that holds the print head and moves back and forth while printing. However, if the carriage is not calibrated correctly, it can lead to print offset and quality issues. Here is how you can fix these issues:

### 1. Lubrication

Lubrication is crucial for your printer system to run smoothly. The carriage slides against the rails to move, and with time, dust, grime, and debris can accumulate, causing the carriage to stick or slide unevenly. Applying lubricant to the rails and the wheels on the carriage will eliminate such problems. 

### 2. Tightening the Carriage

If the carriage is too loose, you'll notice wobbling while printing, resulting in uneven prints. Tightening the carriage will help stabilize the print head, leading to more precise and accurate prints. 

### 3. Calibrating

Calibrating the carriage is essential to prevent prints from offsetting or even failing. A common method is to adjust the belt tension and belt height error. You can use calibration software such as Poke-Home Calibration, which simplifies the process to save you time and effort. 

## The Belt 

The printer belt is responsible for moving the print head and ensuring that precise movements occur with every print. If the belt is not tensioned correctly, it will lead to inconsistent prints and lower precision. Here are some fixes to consider: 

### 1. Replacing the Belt

If your printer belt has become too old or worn out, replacing it is the best solution. With newer, high-quality belts, you'll get more precise prints, and the printer's reliability will improve. 

### 2. Tension Adjustment

A loose printer belt can result in poor print quality and even failure. To avoid this, you need to tighten the belt. Identifying the optimal tension is critical, and it can take some time to achieve. Some methods you can use include adjusting the motor position and using tensioners. 

### 3. Belt Stabilization 

If you've tried tightening the belt but the problem persists, the issue may lie in the belt stabilizing system. You can stabilize the motor mount and add a dampener or shock mount to the printer frame, which minimizes movement and increases stability. 

To Conclude

Your 3D printer's carriage and belt are essential parts that require maintenance and attention. By following the tips and methods discussed in this article, you can revamp your 3D printer, leading to better performance and stunning print quality. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, implementing these fixes is a great way to take your printing to the next level!

Step 1

                  Belts Rear Plate               


 
- 
 - The belt lockers that came in the kit are experimental and should not be used. It's been found that they are not strong enough to hold the belts. The zip-tie method is the only recommended method to secure your belts.
 - 
 - You should have 1 long belt. Start by cutting it in half. It doesn't have to be exactly in half because you will have extra belt length when finished.
 - 
 - Feed the belts through the belt guides on the rear plate. When the rear plate is installed the belt teeth fill be towards the X 2020 extrusion.
 - 
 - If you don't want to use superglue move to the next step.
 - 
 - For added security I like to use a few drops of superglue(I use Loctite Gel). Fold the belt over so the teeth interlock. The belt only needs to overlap no more than about 1 inch. Using a pair of needle nose pliers to hold the belts for about a minute to give the glue time to set.

Step 2

                  Belts Rear Plate               


 
- 
 - Using 4 small zip ties, fasten the belt. Give the long end a few tugs to make sure it doesn't slip.
 - 
 - Cut the "tail" of the zip-tie off. Do not through these away. We will use them later to help route the belts.

Step 4

                  Belt Routing               


 
- 
 - This step isn't required but it makes it easier to route the belts because it gives you something to grab and you can bend the zip-tie to direct it around the pulleys.
 - 
 - Take the zip-tie tails you cut off in step 2. Using superglue, glue the tail to the end of the belt. You don't need more than 10mm of zip-tie glued to the belt.

Step 5

                  Belt Routing               


 
- 
 - Refer to the belt routing PDF in the introduction. Make sure the belt doesn't twist. There's one spot each belt is meant to be flipped otherwise it should be straight.
 - 
 - Looking at the back plate(standing behind the printer) take the "lower" belt and feed it to the left
 - 
 - With the smooth side of the belt touching the bearing, go around the bearing towards the rear corner.
 - 
 - Loop the belt around the lower bearing. The smooth side of the belt will touch the bearing. Pull the belt slack through and towards the other rear corner.

Step 6

                  Belt Routing               


 
- 
 - The picture with the red line shows the belt pulled straight through to the other corner. This is incorrect.
 - 
 - The belt needs to be rotated 180 degrees
 - 
 - The belt is fed through the back corner bearing with the smooth side touching the belt and the teeth facing the rear 2040. Rotate the belt 180 degrees so now the teeth are facing towards the front of the printer.
 - 
 - The graphic shows the belt routing into the Left Corner. The red arrows show the direction to feed the belt and the orange indicates the smooth side of the belt

- 
 - Loop the belt around the Right X Mount bearing with the smooth side against the bearing towards the X carriage
 - 
 - Take your X Carriage Front Plate and feed the belts through their openings. The "lower" belt feeds into the left and the "upper" feeds into the right.
 - 
 - Be sure to route the belt through the back of the Front Plate pulling out any slack in the belt loop.
 - 
 - Secure the Front Plate to the Top Block and the M3x27 standoffs with 4x M3x10 socket head screws.

Step 13

                  Belt Locker               


 
- 
 - When we pull the belts tight to lock them in place we want a little counter tension on the tensioners. Tighten the tensioner knob a few turns until the tensioner looks similar to this.
 - 
 - It is not advised to use the belt lockers that come in the metal kit. They are beta parts but the preferred way is zip-ties
 - 
 - Pull the belts through the front plate so they're tight. I used a few drops of superglue on the smooth side of the belt.
 - 
 - I clamped the belt to the 2020 to give the glue time to dry.
 - 
 - Remove the clamps after 5 minutes. Tighten the zip-ties and cut off the tail and the extra belt length.

I wasn’t paid to write these guides. Ben asked me to do it as a favor to him. Considering all that he’s done for our community I felt it was the least I could do. To be honest even though it took about 2 months to build and document, I had a lot of fun doing it. It forced me to write guides in a manner that was easy for everyone to understand and cleanup my Github so I could share any files that were used that aren’t part of the original download. You’re not obligated but if you would like, feel free to donate.
