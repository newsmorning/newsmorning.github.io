# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Lost My iPhone 6 Baseband - The New One Failed!

It was just another day like any other when I realized that I lost my iPhone 6 baseband. I searched the whole house, but it was nowhere to be found. Panic set in as I realized that without the baseband, my iPhone was as good as dead. Without the baseband, my phone wouldn't be able to connect to any cellular network, rendering it unusable.

I knew I had to act fast, so I immediately brought my iPhone to our local Apple Store. I explained my situation to the technician, and they quickly diagnosed that the only way to fix the issue was to replace the baseband. I was relieved to hear that it was a simple fix, and they immediately went to work.

Fast forward a few days later, I received a call from the Apple Store informing me that my iPhone was ready for pickup. I rushed to the store, excited to have my phone back in my hands. However, my excitement soon turned into disappointment when I found out that the new baseband they installed also failed.

I couldn't believe that after spending a significant amount of money, the same issue occurred again. The technician at the Apple Store explained that it was a rare occurrence and that they would need to look into it.

Another few days passed, and I received yet another call from the Apple Store. They informed me that they had found a fix for my iPhone and that it was now ready to be picked up. I was hesitant but still went and picked it up.

To my surprise, my iPhone was working correctly. The replacement baseband finally worked, and I was relieved that I could use my phone again without any issue. It was stressful to go through such an ordeal, but I'm just happy that it's finally over.

Losing your iPhone baseband is something that no one wants to experience. It's a frustrating situation that can leave you feeling helpless. But don't worry, if you find yourself in a similar situation, just bring it to an authorized Apple technician, and they'll take care of it.

In conclusion, losing my iPhone 6 baseband was stressful, but with the help of the experts, it was fixed in no time. It just goes to show how crucial it is to have a working baseband to ensure that your iPhone can connect to a network. I hope that my experience can help someone who might be going through a similar situation.

## Chosen Solution
 i lost my iphone 6 baseband and i orderd the new baseband and new baseband is not working.. so what to do now please help...

 Baseband cannot be individually replaced. In this situation i believe the repair cost is close or exceeds the value of the phone, consider it a lost cause.
