See Specs and Price Now!\nGone are the days when gaming was just a hobby, now it has become a lifestyle. With the increasing number of game lovers, there has been a clamor for quality gaming devices that offer top-notch gaming experiences.\nInfinix Hot 10 Play, the latest addition to Infinix Hot series, provides everything a gamer could ever ask for. The smartphone is designed to unleash the ultimate gaming experiences with its exceptional specs, user-friendly features, and affordable price. Let’s take a look at what it offers.\nDisplay\nThe phone comes with a massive 6.82-inch LCD screen display, perfect for gamers who love to immerse themselves in their games. Additionally, the screen display has a 720 x 1640 pixel resolution with a 20.5:9 aspect ratio, delivering bright and clear colors.\nProcessor\nFor a smooth gaming experience, the Infinix Hot 10 Play is equipped with a MediaTek Helio G25 processor, which handles intensive graphics with ease. It also has a 2.0 GHz Octa-core CPU, which makes the device faster, allowing you to handle demanding apps swiftly.\nMemory\nInfinix Hot 10 Play boasts a large memory capacity that satisfies gamers’ needs. It has 4GB of RAM that enables gamers to play games seamlessly without any interruption, even when multitasking. In addition to that, it has a 64GB internal storage, expandable up to 512GB with a MicroSD card, providing ample space for games, music, and other apps.\nBattery performance\nThe device has a massive 6000mAh battery coupled with a power-efficient MediaTek Helio G25 processor. This ensures long hours of uninterrupted gaming, music, and web browsing without the need for a recharge.\nCamera\nInfinix Hot 10 Play isn’t just about gaming; it also sports a powerful camera setup. On the back, it has a 13MP primary camera with AI technology that enables you to capture stunning photos with vivid colors and details. The front-facing camera has an 8MP lens with an AI-powered algorithm, perfect for selfies.\nPrice\nNow, the biggest surprise- The Infinix Hot 10 Play is priced at a pocket-friendly range of $150. It’s perfect for game lovers who want to enjoy quality gaming without breaking the bank.\nConclusion\nThe Infinix Hot 10 Play is an ultimate gaming device that caters to the needs of avid gamers. It boasts powerful specs, an expansive screen for a better gaming experience, and a large battery capacity that lasts for long hours of uninterrupted gaming. If you’re looking for an affordable device with high-end gaming features, the Infinix Hot 10 Play should be your go-to option.\nThe year’s still relatively new and OEMs are still busy releasing new gadgets for their customers. Infinix has launched the battery-centric Infinix Hot 10 Play smartphone in Uganda. The device comes with slightly-improved features compared to the predecessor HOT 9 Play.\nWhat’s New? There’s very little differences between the Infinix Hot 10 Play and its predecessor, the Hot 9 Play. They both have the same 6000mAh battery size, same 13MP rear and 8MP front camera setup, similar 6.82 inch LCD screen, the same 32/64 GB inbuilt storage, and the same Android 10 Go edition.\nThe only difference is that the Hot 9 Play wasn’t launched in Uganda last year and it looks like Infinix slapped the new name Hot 10 Play to an old phone and patched a few things.\nThe chipset and GPU are among the patched-up features. Hot 10 Play packs the 12nm MediaTek Helio G25 chip optimized for games and a better video experience.\nThe phone also has MediaTek HyperEngine Game Technology, which supports an intelligent switch between LTE and Wi-Fi, reduces game lag effectively, making your online phone experience smarter than ever.\nConnectivity options include Wi-Fi, GPS, USB OTG, Micro-USB, FM radio, 3G, and 4G. Sensors on the phone include an accelerometer, ambient light sensor, compass/ magnetometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, and fingerprint sensor.\nRelated Article: What to Expect From Transsion (TECNO, Infinix, and itel) in 2021\nInfinix Hot 10 Play Key Specs Colors: Aegean Blue, Morandi Green, Obsidian Black \u0026 PurpleSIM: Dual SIM (Nano-SIM)OS: Android 10 (Go edition), XOS 7Display: 720 x 1640 pixels(~263 ppi density), 6.82 inches IPS LCD capacitive touchscreenCPU: Mediatek Helio G25Memory: 32GB 2GB RAM | 64GB 4GB RAM Camera: 13MP Rear or dual AI dual rear camera and an 8MP Front CameraBattery: Fast charging 10W Non-removable Li-Po 6000 mAh battery\nAlso Read: A Full List of the Best Infinix Phones in 2020\nPrice and Availability Infinix Hot 10 Play is available at every Tecno or Infinix shop countrywide.
