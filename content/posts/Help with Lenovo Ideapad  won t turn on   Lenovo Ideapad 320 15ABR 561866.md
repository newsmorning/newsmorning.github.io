If you are the owner of the Lenovo Ideapad 320 15Abr, you may be familiar with the annoying issue of your laptop not turning on. You press the power button, but nothing happens. The screen remains black, and there are no signs of life. This can be a frustrating experience, especially if you rely on your laptop for work or personal use. But don't panic, as there is an instant solution to this problem that you can try right now.

First, let's look at some of the reasons why your Lenovo Ideapad 320 15Abr may not be turning on. One common cause is a drained battery. If your laptop has been running low on battery for a while and you haven't charged it in some time, it may not have enough power to turn on. Another possibility is a faulty power adapter or charger. If your laptop doesn't receive power from these sources, it won't turn on.

Here's what you can do to fix the problem:

1. Charge the battery

Plug in your laptop and let it charge for at least a few hours. Then try turning it on again. If the battery was the issue, your laptop should start up without any problems.

2. Check the power adapter

Make sure your power adapter is plugged in correctly and there are no loose connections. If you have another adapter, try using that to see if it makes a difference.

3. Perform a power reset

Sometimes a power reset can help fix the issue. To do this, unplug your laptop and remove the battery if possible. Then hold down the power button for around 15 seconds. This will drain all the remaining power from your laptop. Reconnect the battery and power adapter, and then try turning it on again.

4. Contact Lenovo support

If none of these solutions work, it may be a hardware problem that requires professional assistance. Contact Lenovo support for further help and advice.

In conclusion, the Lenovo Ideapad 320 15Abr not turning on can be an alarming issue, but there are simple solutions to it that you can try before contacting support. In most cases, it's a battery or power adapter issue that can be fixed quickly. If you have tried all the troubleshooting steps and your laptop still won't turn on, don't hesitate to reach out to Lenovo support for further assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi there
I have a Lenovo Ideapad 320 (Model number 80XS00DJUS) thats about almost three years old now. I will say that I did drop it at one point, and parts did come off, and the hard drive died which I did replace with a smaller GB drive but nonetheless it still worked for a good while. One day it just didn’t wanna come on though, even when connected to the adapter.
I opened it up and took a look inside, everything “looks” fine but obviously something isnt. My guess is probably the battery, maybe the motherboard?
My question is if I should buy the battery only first just to save some money or could it be more of a motherboard issue?

 Hi @pago ,
Have you tried a different compatible adapter at all, you didn't say?
Is the AC Power adapter status light on the laptop blinking, solid (which colour?) or even on when the adapter is connected to the laptop?
If not on at all, it may be a problem with the DC-In jack and maybe the battery has been depleted because it couldn't be charged.
Before buying a battery you need to check if voltage is being applied to the motherboard by the charger.
Here’s the hardware maintenance manual for your model laptop.
On p.21 it shows how to test if the adapter’s output voltage is OK.
On p.60 it shows the necessary pre-requisite steps and then the procedure to remove the systemboard so that the DC-In socket which is hard mounted on the board can be accessed and tested with an Ohmmeter, to ensure that there is a good electrical connection between the input to the socket and the motherboard. Check if the socket feels “loose” on the board
