## Chosen Solution
 Hi, My samsung galaxy note 5 has a black screen
and sometimes it flickers when ever I do certain things. Sometimes I can see the home screen and use it then it either goes to sleep or turns back to black I don't know which. Cannot even see the boot screen I can only hear volume and the home button also still works but the back is cracked.

 It sounds like you have a bad lcd.  Did this start happening after the back was cracked?
