# Revolutionize Your Charging Game - Transform Your Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 Wi-Fi with this Simple Hack!

Are you tired of waiting for hours to fully charge your Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 Wi-Fi? Do you wish to charge your tablet faster and more efficiently? Look no further, as we have a simple hack that will revolutionize your charging game and transform your tablet's charging performance.

Before we reveal the hack, let us understand some basics of charging. Your Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 Wi-Fi comes with a battery that has a capacity of 5000mAh. The charger that comes with the tablet has an output rating of 5 volts and 1.55 amperes. This means that the charger is capable of supplying a current of up to 1.55 amperes to your tablet.

Now, here's the hack: Use a charger that has a higher output rating than the one that came with your tablet. For example, if you use a charger with an output rating of 5 volts and 2.4 amperes, you can increase the charging current to your tablet, which, in turn, will significantly reduce the charging time.

But wait, before you go ahead and use any charger that you may have lying around, it is essential to use a charger that is compatible with your tablet. Using a charger that is not compatible may cause damage to your tablet's battery and hardware.

Therefore, the best option here is to invest in a charger that is specifically designed for your Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 Wi-Fi. One such charger is the Adaptive Fast Charging Wall Charger. This charger has an output rating of 5 volts and 2.0 amperes, which is higher than the charger that came with your tablet. This charger is designed to provide fast and efficient charging to your tablet while keeping it safe from any damage.

In addition to using a compatible charger, here are some other tips to help you charge your Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 Wi-Fi faster and more efficiently:

1. Charge your tablet when it's switched off or in airplane mode.

2. Use a high-quality charging cable that is not frayed or damaged.

3. Avoid using your tablet while it's charging as this increases the charging time.

4. Keep your tablet in a cool and well-ventilated spot while charging.

By following these tips and using a compatible charger, you can significantly reduce the charging time of your Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 Wi-Fi and extend the battery life of your tablet.

In conclusion, revolutionize your charging game and transform your Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 Wi-Fi's charging performance with this simple hack. Investing in a compatible charger and following some charging tips can make a significant difference in the charging time and battery life of your tablet. So, what are you waiting for?
