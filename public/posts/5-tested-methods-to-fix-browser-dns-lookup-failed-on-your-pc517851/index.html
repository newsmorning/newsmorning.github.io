Have you ever experienced browsing the internet when suddenly, an error message pops up saying “DNS lookup failed” or “ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED”? If you have, then you’re not alone. DNS lookup errors are among the most common issues users encounter when browsing the web.\nBut what exactly is a DNS lookup error? How does it affect your browsing experience? Most importantly, how can you fix it? In this article, we’ll explore these questions and provide five ultimate solutions to help you fix DNS lookup errors on any PC.\nWhat is a DNS Lookup Error and How Does it Affect Your Browsing? DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is a network protocol used to translate domain names into IP addresses. Every time you type in a URL or click a link, your web browser sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address. The IP address is used to establish a connection between your device and the remote server hosting the website you’re trying to access.\nWhen a DNS lookup error occurs, it means that the DNS server failed to translate the domain name into an IP address, causing your browser to fail to connect to the website. This error message can be frustrating, especially if you’re in the middle of an important task or research.\nDNS lookup errors can be caused by different factors, including incorrect DNS settings, network connectivity issues, expired DNS cache, or the website you’re trying to access is down.\n5 Ultimate Solutions to Fix DNS Lookup Errors on Any PC Here are five ultimate solutions that you can try to fix DNS lookup errors on any PC:\nSolution #1: Clear DNS Cache One of the most common causes of DNS lookup errors is an expired DNS cache. Your device stores a cache of recently visited websites to speed up the browsing experience. However, over time, the cache may become corrupted, causing DNS lookup errors.\nTo fix this issue, you need to clear your DNS cache. Here’s how:\nOpen Command Prompt as an administrator by right-clicking on it and selecting “Run as administrator.” Type “ipconfig /flushdns” and hit Enter. Wait for the process to complete, then restart your browser and try accessing the website again. Solution #2: Switch DNS Servers If the issue persists after clearing your DNS cache, the problem may lie with the DNS server you’re using. Your internet service provider (ISP) may be using a slow or unreliable DNS server, causing DNS lookup errors.\nTo resolve this issue, you can switch to a different DNS server, such as Google DNS or OpenDNS. Here’s how:\nOn your device, go to Control Panel \u003e Network and Sharing Center.\nClick on “Change adapter settings” on the left-hand menu.\nRight-click on the network adapter you’re using and select Properties.\nIn the properties window, scroll down to “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)” and click Properties.\nSelect “Use the following DNS server addresses” and enter the DNS server address provided by your preferred DNS provider (e.g., Google DNS – 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).\nClick OK and save the changes. Restart your browser and try accessing the website again.\nSolution #3: Disable Firewall or Antivirus Software Sometimes, firewall or antivirus software can interfere with your device’s network connections, causing DNS lookup errors. If this is the case, you can try disabling the software temporarily to see if it fixes the issue.\nTo disable firewall or antivirus software, follow the instructions provided by your software vendor. Make sure to enable the software again once you’ve finished browsing.\nSolution #4: Release and Renew IP Address Another common cause of DNS lookup errors is an incorrect IP address. Your device may be using an outdated IP address or a conflicting IP address, causing connectivity issues.\nTo resolve this issue, you can release and renew your IP address. Here’s how:\nOpen Command Prompt as an administrator by right-clicking on it and selecting “Run as administrator.” Type “ipconfig /release” and hit Enter. Wait for the process to complete, then type “ipconfig /renew” and hit Enter. Wait for the process to complete, then restart your browser and try accessing the website again. Solution #5: Reset Network Configurations If none of the solutions above works, you may need to reset your network configurations. This will reset all network configurations to their default settings, eliminating any customization or modified settings that may be causing the DNS lookup errors.\nTo reset network configurations, follow these steps:\nOpen Command Prompt as an administrator by right-clicking on it and selecting “Run as administrator.” Type “netsh winsock reset” and hit Enter. Wait for the process to complete, then restart your device and try accessing the website again. Conclusion DNS lookup errors can be frustrating, but they’re not impossible to fix. By following these ultimate solutions, you can say goodbye to browser frustration forever and enjoy seamless browsing experience. Clearing DNS cache, switching DNS servers, disabling firewall or antivirus software, releasing and renewing IP address, and resetting network configurations are easy fixes that can help you resolve most DNS lookup errors.\nThe DNS lookup failed message on the browser is a net connection error. The Google Chrome error message states This webpage is not available. The server at… can’t be found, because the DNS lookup failed.\nCheck the browser cookies and cache or switch to a public DNS server Users reported getting DNS lookup failed errors when using their browsers.\nIf you too encountered this error message, clear the browser cookies and cache, or flush the DNS, amongst other methods here.\nAlso, find out how to find the DNS server in Windows.\nEasy migration: use the Opera assistant to transfer exiting data, such as bookmarks, passwords, etc.\nOptimize resource usage: your RAM memory is used more efficiently than in other browsers\nEnhanced privacy: free and unlimited VPN integrated\nNo ads: built-in Ad Blocker speeds up loading of pages and protects against data-mining\nGaming friendly: Opera GX is the first and best browser for gaming\nDownload Opera\nThe error message prevents users from accessing the website, but it, in most cases, doesn’t have to do with the website at all. Rather, the error is related to misconfigured browser settings, the presence of conflicting applications, or issues with the current DNS server.\nMany came across the error in these cases:\n504 DNS lookup failed FortiGate: Users with the FortiGate firewall have reported encountering the error frequently, and disabling the firewall did the trick. DNS lookup failed VPN: When encountering the error while using a VPN, switching to a reliable VPN should fix the error. So, let’s find out how you can fix the DNS lookup failed error on your browser in the following sections, and all about the error itself.\nWhat does it mean when DNS failed? A DNS failed error basically indicates the inability to connect to the corresponding IP address of the website. It could be to problems with the DNS server itself, misconfigured network settings, or third-party applications conflicting with it.\nIn most cases, the solutions are simple and things are up and running in a jiffy. Many recommend switching to public DNS servers, such as that of Google, to eliminate errors like these.\nQuick Tip: If Google Chrome persists in showing you the error message even after you tried all troubleshooting solutions, you should try using a different browser instead. Opera is a great alternative.\nNot only is it incredibly powerful and lightweight, but it is also extremely stable, receiving updates after updates that are constantly maintained in peak condition.\nWhy do we need DNS? Every website on the Internet is assigned an address, which consists of a string of numbers and characters. To simplify things for users, websites are also assigned a domain name. For instance, https://windowsreport.com/, is the domain name and not the IP address.\nOpera A web browser that balances out stability, performance, a high level of customization, and low system requirements.\nNow, while people understand the domain name, computers, on the other hand, use the assigned IP address.\nThis is where the DNS (Domain Name System) server comes into the picture. When you enter the domain name in the address bar of the browser, it locates the corresponding IP address and opens the website. And when the DNS fails, the website won’t open.\nWhat to do if the browser stops working after DNS fail? 1. Clear cookies and cache Launch the browser, and press Ctrl + Shift + Del to open the Clear browsing data utility. Select All time from the Time range dropdown menu. Select the checkboxes for Browsing history, Cookies and other site data, and Cached images and files, and then click on Clear data at the bottom. If the manual method seems like too much of a hassle, you could always opt for a third-party PC cleaner. This type of tool will scan your browser for unnecessary clutter and let you know what can be removed.\nSome PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.\nExpert tip:\nSPONSORED\nAlongside cleaning your browser, dedicated cookie cleaners generally include other PC optimization tools such as registry cleaners and startup editors.\nOn top of that, some browser cleaners will help you remove unwanted toolbars and plugins, remove spam/useless emails, and more.\nWe recommend CCleaner from the list of software we tested, which performs thorough cleaning, as one of the best tools for this task.\nCCleaner makes it simple to get the most out of your computer because PC maintenance has to be at the top of the priority list. Furthermore, if you can tune up your computer on a regular basis, you’ll be more satisfied with its overall performance.\nOnce done, check if the DNS lookup failed error on the browser is fixed.\n2. Open the Internet Connections Troubleshooter Press Windows + I to open the Settings app, and click on Troubleshoot on the right. Next, click on Other troubleshooters. Locate the Internet Connections option here, and click on the Run button next to it. Then go through the suggested resolutions from the troubleshooter. Once done, check if the DNS lookup still fails intermittently on the browser. If that’s the case, head to the next method.\n3. Change the DNS Server Press Windows + S to launch the Run command, enter ncpa.cpl in the text field, and click OK. Right-click the active connection to select Properties. Now, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), and click the Properties button. Select the Use the following DNS server addresses radio button, and enter the following DNS server in the two fields: Preferred DNS server: 8.8.8.8 Alternate DNS server: 8.8.4.4 Click the OK button at the bottom of this and other windows to save the changes. 4. Flush the DNS Press Windows + S to open the Search menu, enter Terminal in the text field, right-click on the relevant search result, and select Run as administrator. Click Yes in the UAC prompt. Press Ctrl + Shift + 2 to open Command Prompt in a new tab. Now, paste the following command and hit Enter:ipconfig /flushdns Flushing the DNS cache is a straightforward potential resolution for the DNS lookup failed error on browsers.\nPreferred DNS server: 8.8.8.8 Alternate DNS server: 8.8.4.4 5. Restart the Network Stack Press Windows + X to open the Quick Access menu, and select Windows Terminal (Admin). Click Yes in the UAC prompt. Click on the arrow at the top, and select Command Prompt from the menu. Now, paste the following command and hit Enter:netsh winsock reset catalog Once done, restart the computer for the changes to come into effect. Some users might need to restart a corrupted network stack to fix the DNS lookup failed error on the browser.\nHow do I find my DNS server? Press Windows + R to open Run, type ncpa.cpl in the text field, and click OK. Now, double-click on the active network adapter. Click on Details. You will now find the DNS server listed here. The above resolutions will probably resolve the DNS lookup failed error for most users so that they can open webpages in Chrome and other browsers, whenever the error is encountered\nAlso, find out what to do when seeing the Your DNS server might be unavailable error message in Windows 10/11.\nTell us which fix worked for you in the comments section below.\nBrowser errors Email *\nCommenting as .

Rather, the error is related to misconfigured browser settings, the presence of conflicting applications, or issues with the current DNS server.</p><p>Many came across the error in these cases:</p><ul><li>504 DNS lookup failed FortiGate: Users with the FortiGate firewall have reported encountering the error frequently, and disabling the firewall did the trick.</li><li>DNS lookup failed VPN: When encountering the error while using a VPN, switching to a reliable VPN should fix the error.</li></ul><p>So, let’s find out how you can fix the DNS lookup failed error on your browser in the following sections, and all about the error itself.</p><h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-dns-failed>What does it mean when DNS failed?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-does-it-mean-when-dns-failed>#</a></h2><p>A DNS failed error basically indicates the inability to connect to the corresponding IP address of the website. It could be to problems with the DNS server itself, misconfigured network settings, or third-party applications conflicting with it.</p><p>In most cases, the solutions are simple and things are up and running in a jiffy. Many recommend switching to public DNS servers, such as that of Google, to eliminate errors like these.</p><h4 id=quick-tip>Quick Tip:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#quick-tip>#</a></h4><p>If Google Chrome persists in showing you the error message even after you tried all troubleshooting solutions, you should try using a different browser instead. Opera is a great alternative.</p><p>Not only is it incredibly powerful and lightweight, but it is also extremely stable, receiving updates after updates that are constantly maintained in peak condition.</p><h4 id=why-do-we-need-dns>Why do we need DNS?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-do-we-need-dns>#</a></h4><p>Every website on the Internet is assigned an address, which consists of a string of numbers and characters. To simplify things for users, websites are also assigned a domain name. For instance, <a href=https://windowsreport.com/>https://windowsreport.com/</a>, is the domain name and not the IP address.</p><h3 id=opera>Opera<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#opera>#</a></h3><p>A web browser that balances out stability, performance, a high level of customization, and low system requirements.</p><p>Now, while people understand the domain name, computers, on the other hand, use the assigned IP address.</p><p>This is where the DNS (Domain Name System) server comes into the picture. When you enter the domain name in the address bar of the browser, it locates the corresponding IP address and opens the website. And when the DNS fails, the website won’t open.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-if-the-browser-stops-working-after-dns-fail>What to do if the browser stops working after DNS fail?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-to-do-if-the-browser-stops-working-after-dns-fail>#</a></h2><h3 id=1-clear-cookies-and-cache>1.
