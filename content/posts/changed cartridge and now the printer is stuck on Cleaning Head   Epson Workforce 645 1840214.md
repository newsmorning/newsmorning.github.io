Printer Disaster: How Changing the Cartridge on Your Epson Workforce 645 Can Leave You Stuck in Head-Cleaning Hell!

When it comes to printers, we all know that changing the cartridge is an essential task. However, what many don't realize is that changing the cartridge can lead to a potential disaster. This is particularly true with Epson Workforce 645 printers.

Epson Workforce 645 is a popular printer model, well-known for its high-quality printing and efficient features. However, when it comes to changing the cartridge, users have reported several issues that leave them stuck in head-cleaning hell.

The main problem with changing the cartridge on this printer model is that it can cause the printer to become clogged with ink. This is because when a new cartridge is installed, the printer will automatically start a head-cleaning process. This process is essential as it ensures that the ink is flowing correctly and that there are no blockages that can affect the quality of the printing output.

The head-cleaning process can take several minutes, depending on the amount of ink that needs to be cleaned. During this time, the printer will use a considerable amount of ink, and if the printer is not used for an extended period, it can lead to the print head drying out. This can cause blockages in the ink tubes, making it extremely difficult to print anything correctly.

If you find yourself stuck in head-cleaning hell, there are a few things you can do to try and fix the problem. Firstly, try printing a few pages of text or images that use a lot of ink. This will help to keep the ink flowing and prevent it from drying out in the tubes.

If this doesn't work, try running the head-cleaning process manually. To do this, go to the printer settings on your computer and select the option to run a head-cleaning process. The process could take a few minutes, but it will be worth it in the long run.

However, if none of these methods work, then it might be time to call in a professional. A printer expert will be able to diagnose the problem and get your printer back up and running in no time.

In conclusion, changing the cartridge on your Epson Workforce 645 printer can be a potential disaster if you're not aware of the head-cleaning process that follows. However, by following these simple steps, you can avoid getting stuck in head-cleaning hell and ensure that your printer continues to produce high-quality prints with ease.


## Chosen Solution
 Change the cartridge but it won't print.  IT keeps saying "cleaning head and I'm losing inks.  I have lost 3 cartridge already, it just keeps draining all my ink and not printing.

This is a common problem with this printer. The inkjets have the tendency to clog, especially if you are not using the printer often, or even if you are using it often, but only printing black. Normally the "Head Cleaning" maintenance routine will clear the jet head. However, the cleaning process always takes an unacceptable amount of ink and in your case (and mine at this moment) the cleaning routine makes no improvement. Regardless of the routines failure, it still uses more ink than any normal person can afford. I am researching the issue and will post any helpful info I can find.

 Here is a guide with several methods to clean your Epson printer in ascending order of ruthlessness :)
