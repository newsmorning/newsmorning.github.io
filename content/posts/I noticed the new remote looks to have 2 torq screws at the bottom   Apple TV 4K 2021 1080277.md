## You won't believe what we just discovered about the new Apple TV 4K 2021 remote - secrets revealed with 2 mysterious torq screws!

If you are one of the Apple TV enthusiasts, then you must have heard about the latest edition of the Apple TV, the Apple TV 4K 2021. The latest edition of Apple TV has brought some exciting features for its users, including its ultra-smart remote control. However, did you know that the new Apple TV 4K 2021 remote has some hidden secrets?

Yes, you heard it right. The new Apple TV 4K 2021 remote control has some hidden secrets that were revealed recently when tech enthusiasts tried to disassemble it. Interestingly, the remote control of the latest Apple TV 4K 2021 includes two mysterious torq screws, which is not common among various remote controls available in the market.

When tech enthusiasts finally got the chance to disassemble the remote, they found out a small battery compartment that has been placed precisely in the center of the remote. It is indeed a revelation for the tech enthusiasts who love to peek inside such devices and customize it according to their preferences.

Moreover, two screws have been added, which makes it more difficult for the average user to open the remote control. However, not to worry, as there are always ways to remove and reassemble the remote control without damaging it.

The two screws are of the torq category, which requires specific sized screwdrivers to open it. These screws are not easily accessible in most households' toolboxes, mainly because they are not standard screws available in the market.

While this may seem like a minor tweak, it provides a considerable advantage as it prevents the remote from accidental and unwanted opening. This small but useful detail is entirely meaningful when it comes to the quality of a product.

In conclusion, the new Apple TV 4K 2021 remote control has some hidden secrets with its two torq screws. Many people would not consider it a significant tweak, but these small changes make a massive difference in the long run. It protects the product from accidental opening and adds to the product's quality.
