# Shockingly Common Tech Error: Keyboard Replacement Kills MacBook Pro – Find Out How to Avoid!

If you own a MacBook Pro, you have probably experienced the frustration of a malfunctioning keyboard. In recent years, Apple has faced criticism for the design of their MacBook Pro keyboards, which have been prone to breaking and getting stuck.

As a result, many MacBook Pro owners have chosen to have their keyboards replaced. However, what many people don’t realize is that keyboard replacement can be a dangerous process for their device. In fact, it’s shockingly common for MacBook Pros to become permanently damaged during keyboard replacement.

Here’s what you need to know to avoid this tech error and keep your MacBook Pro safe.

## The Danger of Keyboard Replacement

When you take your MacBook Pro to a repair shop, they will likely suggest replacing your keyboard if it’s malfunctioning. This can seem like a straightforward and easy solution, but in reality, keyboard replacement is a tricky process that requires significant technical expertise.

The issue is that the MacBook Pro’s keyboard is integrated into the top case and connected to the device’s logic board with a ribbon cable. This means that replacing the keyboard requires first removing the top case, which can put a lot of pressure on the logic board and cause damage if not done correctly.

If your MacBook Pro’s logic board is damaged during keyboard replacement, your device might become unusable. This is an extremely costly mistake, as a new logic board can cost as much as a new MacBook Pro.

## How to Avoid Damaging Your MacBook Pro During Keyboard Replacement

There are a few things you can do to help ensure that your MacBook Pro stays safe during keyboard replacement:

1. Trust the professionals – While some tech-savvy individuals might try to replace their MacBook Pro’s keyboard themselves, it’s best to leave this job to the experts. A qualified repair shop will have the experience and tools necessary to replace your keyboard safely.

2. Research your repair shop – Before you take your device to be repaired, do your research on the shop and read reviews from past customers. Make sure the shop has a good reputation for successful MacBook Pro repairs.

3. Ask about warranties – A reputable repair shop will offer warranties for their repairs. This means that if anything goes wrong during or after the repair, you won’t be responsible for the cost of fixing it.

4. Choose the right repair option – In some cases, it might be better to replace your entire MacBook Pro rather than just the keyboard. If your device is already several years old and experiencing multiple issues, it might be more cost-effective to simply invest in a new device rather than paying for multiple repairs.

## Final Thoughts

While MacBook Pro keyboard replacement might seem like a straightforward solution to your device’s malfunction, it’s important to recognize the risks involved. Damaging your device’s logic board during keyboard replacement can lead to significant costs and ultimately render your device unusable.

By trusting the professionals, researching your repair shop, and choosing the right repair option, you can help ensure that your MacBook Pro stays safe during repairs – and that you don’t end up with a costly tech error on your hands.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, everyone! I recently picked up a Retina Macbook Pro 13" a1425 to fix up. When I got it, it would only power on when you plugged in the magsafe and the fans would run  on high. Since it wouldn't respond to the keyboard, I assumed some liquid damage on the keyboard.
I purchased a replacement keyboard and just installed it. Now, it doesn't power on when you plug in a magsafe, but it also doesn't power on with the power button. The keyboard does appear to be working though because I can perform an SMC reset (which doesn't help). When the magsafe is plugged in, the light goes from green to amber. It will also go to amber if I unplug the battery.
Anybody have any ideas?

 Disconnect the keyboard ribbon cable and then use the power pads to start the system are you able to get it to startup that way? If you can carefully reseat the ribbon cable making sure it's squarely and fully inserted. I use a small strip of electicans tape which I fold over one end to make a pull to help in seating the cable.

 Can you power up the system with the battery connector unplugged?
