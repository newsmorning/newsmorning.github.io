## Chosen Solution
 So last week I almost drill a 3.7mm screw straight through my 8 plus motherboard listening to the ifixit guide, luckily I thought twice about this and when to find another source, also on  ifixit, this week I'm working on my 8 plus again and of course I got the screws mixed up last time, if anybody could make me a ACCURATE diagram of placement, nail head type and length of each screw in the xs max, i only need it for the housing but im sure the screen would hurt as referencefor other users reading this later, Please DONT refer me to I fixing guide, its wrong and will cause short circuits if followed!!!! ALSO, dear Ifixit, please fix this

 Hi
If you look through this guide you should be able to find the screw lengths you need
https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+X+Re...
This guide if for a iPhone X but the XS and X are quite similar
Also here’s for the 8+ too
iPhone 8 Plus Lightning Connector Assembly Replacement
When the guide talks about taking the screws out it will also say the lengths
Hopefully this helps
Any questions please ask
Thanks:-)

 Couple of things to note here. Firstly, please mention which guide you led you astray so we can have a look and make sure the info there is accurate. iFixit certainly doesn't want you or anyone else's devices to inadvertently come to harm due to misinformation.
Secondly, although screw charts are helpful they are no substitute for common sense and good organization. Investing in a good magnetic mat, screw organizing tray or literally a piece of tape sticky side up has saved my butt on more than one occasion. If a screw doesn't feel like it goes in a place, it probably doesn't. Lay out the screws near their cowlings in the same pattern you pulled them out of the device.
Thirdly I don't have a screw diagram for these that includes measurements but you might find the Mobile Sentrix screwbox page helpful. No screw sizes, but it does have pictures and locations of the screws.
You also mention both the 8 Plus and the XS Max in your question so I'm hoping that's the correct one. Also. If you're talking about the "long screw" for the cowling over the display, battery and other connectors, it goes in the screw hole closest to the speaker.
