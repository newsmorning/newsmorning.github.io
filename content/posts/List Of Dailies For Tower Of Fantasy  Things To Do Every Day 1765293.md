Before we dive into the to-do list, let's recap some of the essential gameplay aspects of Tower of Fantasy.

Now, without further ado, let's jump into the ultimate daily to-do list that can take your gaming experience to a whole new level!

Completing daily missions is the easiest and fastest way to gain experience points (XP) and level up in Tower of Fantasy. NPCs give out daily missions every day, and some of them can be repeated, giving you a chance to earn extra XP and rewards.

## 2. Farming

Farming is a popular way of gaining XP and resources in Tower of Fantasy. Once you have unlocked a new area, you can farm monsters and gather resources to boost your character's abilities. Remember to prioritize farming areas where rare and higher-level monsters spawn.

Completing daily tasks is similar to daily missions, but they offer a more significant amount of rewards. A player can perform up to 10 daily tasks per day, and each task rewards you with resources and XP.

## 4. Group Activities

The collaborative aspect of Tower of Fantasy sets it apart from other games in the genre. Joining groups, alliances, or guilds can help you level up faster and gain access to exclusive resources and areas.

## 5. Boss Raids

Boss raids are the ultimate challenge in Tower of Fantasy. These tough opponents require collaboration between players, and taking them down can reward you with rare loot and XP.
