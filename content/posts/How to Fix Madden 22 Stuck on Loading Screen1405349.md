These problems can be incredibly frustrating, especially if you're trying to enjoy a quick game during your free time.

## Why the Madden 22 Loading Screen Issue Happens

There can be several reasons for Madden 22's loading screen issues. Some of the common causes include:

## Solution

Fortunately, there are several ways to fix the Madden 22 loading screen problems. Here are some simple solutions that might help:

### Update Your Graphics Drivers

Updating your graphics drivers can help fix many issues with the game's graphics and loading times. To update your graphics drivers, navigate to your graphics card manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers for your system. Once you've installed the drivers, restart your computer and try running the game again.

### Validate Game Files

Sometimes, files in the Madden 22 game installation might become corrupted, causing the loading screen problem. To fix this issue, validate the game files on your system. To do this, go to your game library and right-click on Madden 22. Select the "Properties" option, then click on the "Local Files" tab.

Make sure to check your internet connection's speed and stability to ensure that it's working properly. Turn off any other devices that might be using your network so that Madden 22 can use the most bandwidth.

## How To Fix Madden 22 Stuck on Loading Screen
 

 
There are some methods that you need to follow to resolve this issue.
 
### Method 1: Restart your PC
 
The first step one can take while fixing temporary glitches on your PC is to restart your computer. This method works most of the time and a reboot clears your RAM. When your PC restarts it starts afresh and then you can launch Madden 22 without opening other programs to check if the issue was permanent or temporary.
 
### Method 2: Restart Your Router
 
The Internet plays a major role while playing games and streaming movies online. The Madden 22 glitch might occur due to a temp cache on your router and a reboot will fix many things. Here are the steps to restart the router:

Step 3: Wait for one minute and then attach the power cable.
 
Step 4: Now turn on the router power switch and connect your PC to the internet.
 
Your ISP will provide you with a new IP address as most personal connections have a dynamic IP address.

We recommend using Advanced Driver Updater, a third-party driver updater tool to update all your drivers without consuming less time and effort. Here are the steps:
 
Step 1: Click the Download button to download and install Advanced Driver Updater.

Step 4: Restart your computer after the process is completed to ensure that the modifications are applied.
 
### Method 6: Use a VPN
 
A Virtual Private Network helps mask your IP address and break geo-restrictions applied if any. Hence using a VPN would allow you to connect to any gaming server across the globe and remove any barriers due to internet tor location. We suggest using Systweak VPN which is one of the finest examples of VPN apps.
 
Systweak VPN, which combines smart DNS and a kill switch, is one of the best VPN services for Windows. This VPN for Windows protects your online privacy by allowing anonymous browsing and concealing your IP address with military-grade AES 256-bit encryption. This open VPN service allows you to escape ISP throttling. In addition to disguising your IP address and safeguarding you from the risks of public Wi-Fi, Systweak VPN has several other features.
 
There are no restrictions based on location. Using a virtual private network application like Systweak VPN, all IP region-based restrictions imposed by streaming services like Netflix are abolished.
 
Maintains the security and privacy of the user. Because no hacker can track your original IP address or location, a VPN application ensures privacy and security. Your laptop is also free of viruses, malware, and other types of trackers.
 
Securely sharing files. You may rest assured that data sent over a public Wi-Fi network is encrypted and unreadable by hackers.
 
There is a remote access option available. You may quickly set up remote access from your laptop to your company or home computer if you activate your VPN on any network, including public Wi-Fi. You will have complete control over this virtual private network, which will be hacker-proof.
