# Revolutionize Your Streaming Game with Logitech's Hot New Secret Weapon: The S Litra Glow!

Streaming is becoming increasingly popular every day. Whether you're a professional gamer, a content creator, or just someone looking to share your passion with the world, streaming is one of the best ways to do it. However, there's always room for improvement, and that's where Logitech's latest innovation, the S Litra Glow, comes in.

## What is S Litra Glow?

S Litra Glow is a powerful and versatile lighting solution that enhances the quality of streams and videos by providing consistent and high-quality lighting. It comes in a compact form factor and can be easily attached to any camera or tripod, making it the perfect on-the-go lighting solution.

## How Does It Work?

The S Litra Glow features 10 adjustable brightness settings that allow you to customize the amount of light you need for your streaming setup. It uses a built-in battery that lasts up to four hours, which means you no longer have to worry about replacing batteries in the middle of your stream.

One of the standout features of S Litra Glow is its compatibility with Logitech's G HUB. G HUB is a software that allows Logitech devices to interconnect and perform advanced functions. With S Litra Glow, you can sync lighting effects with other Logitech devices like keyboards and mice, creating a unified lighting experience for your entire streaming setup.

## Why Do You Need S Litra Glow?

Lighting is one of the most important aspects of any streaming setup. Poor lighting can affect the video quality and make it hard for viewers to see what's going on. S Litra Glow provides even and consistent lighting, eliminating any of these issues and making your streams look more professional.

The S Litra Glow is also highly customizable, enabling you to create lighting effects that suit your personal style. Whether you want a soft glow or a dramatic effect, the adjustable settings make it easy to achieve.

## Conclusion

If you're looking to take your streaming setup to the next level, S Litra Glow is the perfect solution. Its versatility, compatibility, and high-quality lighting make it an essential accessory for anyone who wants to produce professional and engaging content.

Logitech has introduced the new Litra Glow, a high-quality lightning device powered by TrueSoft technology made specifically for online streaming.

 

The Litra Glow is a small 3.56-inch by 3.56-inch light that sits on top of a monitor mount, which allows the device to go on top of any desktop or laptop. It also pairs up with Logitech's G HUB app so you can control its settings, such as the brightness and color temperature.

 

Logitech claims the Litra Glow will bathe you in warm, soft, flattering light for a natural look across all skin tones using what it calls "TrueSoft" tech. The device is meant to produce cinema-quality light and the company promises a 93 CRI (Color Rendering Index) rating, which is on the cusp of professional-grade equipment. Logitech also claims the light is gentle on the eyes and possible to use safely for long streaming sessions.

 

The monitor mount can be adjusted in three different ways for the best lighting position possible and can be detached from the mount and placed on a tripod if you prefer it that way. Setting up the Litra Glow seems fairly easy as you only need to connect the USB cable to your computer.In addition to brightness and temperature control, a free G HUB desktop app allows you to create lighting presets. If you have a Logitech G keyboard or mouse, you can assign those presets to G Keys.

 

The Litra Glow releases later this month in the US, Canada, Australia, and select European countries, although Logitech didn't clarify which ones. You can pre-order the Litra Glow right now for $59.99.
