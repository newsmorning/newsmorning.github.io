Title: You Won't Believe What Happened After I Replaced My iPad 5 Wi-Fi Screen: My Home Button Just STOPPED Working!

Introduction

The iPad 5 is a fantastic tablet, but sometimes accidents happen, and you may need to replace the screen. However, what happens when you replace the screen, but your home button stops working? That's precisely what happened to me. I couldn't believe it. I thought I had done everything right, but no matter how many times I tried, the home button wouldn't respond. In this article, I want to share what happened, what I did, and how my iPad is now fully functional again.

Body

I had never replaced an iPad screen before, but after a little research, I felt confident that I could do it. Before starting, I made sure to have all the tools I needed, watched tutorial videos and read articles to prepare myself. After taking my time and being careful, I was able to switch out the damaged screen and connect everything back together. Everything looked good, and I even tested the touch screen to make sure everything was working.

That's when disaster struck – the home button wouldn't work. I tried everything, from resetting the connections to hard resetting the tablet, but nothing worked. I did further research, and it turned out that the home button needs to be paired with the original logic board. The home button has a sensor that only works with the original logic board's sensor. When you replace the screen or logic board, the new home button must be paired, or it just won't work.

After more research, I found a home button pairing tool that paired my new home button with the new screen's logic board. This tool can also be used to replace the logic board and still have the new home button work correctly. I followed the instructions and paired the home button. Finally, the home button worked again!

Conclusion

Replacing an iPad screen can be a daunting task, especially if you've never done it before. It's essential to do the proper research and have all the necessary tools. Even after all the preparation, things can go wrong. In my case, the home button stopped working. However, with more research, I found a solution, and now my iPad is fully functional again. The lesson is that when you replace the iPad screen, always remember to pair the home button. So, if you ever need to replace your iPad screen, don't forget to pair the home button, or you may end up like me!

## Chosen Solution
 Went through the process of replacing the screen/digitizer for iPad 5 wifi - went as expected considering original was shattered. Got to the point of putting the new on the front and the home button no longer works - went to take the NEW screen/digitizer off to check connections - and gee guess what the new screen/digitizer is now cracked- guess I am now off to buy a 2nd replacement screen … AND all of the connection are in place for the home button - I know the touch will not work - but the button itself should at least …. Any one have any ideas on this??  Going to see if there is a home button with touch that I can buy for replacement ….

 Was the home button transferred from the old screen to the new screen?
Note that if you bought a replacement iPad Air digitizer with the home button you’ll need to carefully transfer the home button from the original screen because only the home button that came with the iPad will work on there.
iPad Air 1st gen home buttons are unfortunately not compatible with the iPad 5th generation. I’ve had to source out a replacement iPad 5th gen button which was hard to find as it had to be the same model. With a replacement button you’ll lose touch ID but the button will at least work.
