title: You Won't Believe What's Really Happening Inside Your LG TV!

subtitle: Find Out Why You Have No Picture But Sound And Backlight Here!

---

Are you experiencing trouble with your LG TV? Is the picture not showing up but you can hear the sound? Or maybe you have a backlight but no image? These are common issues that users of LG TVs face. But have you ever wondered what's really happening inside your TV that's causing this problem? Well, wonder no more.

Firstly, let's take a look at some of the main components of your LG TV.

## Main Components of an LG TV

### LED/LCD Panel

The LED/LCD panel is the primary component that produces the picture on your LG TV. There are millions of tiny pixels on the screen that light up to generate the image. The panel is made up of several layers, including a backlight layer, an LCD layer, a color filter layer, and a protective layer.

### Mainboard

The mainboard, also known as the motherboard, is the central processing unit that controls all the other components of your LG TV. It contains the microprocessor, memory chips, and other circuitry that allow your TV to function correctly.

### Power Supply Board

The power supply board regulates the power supply to your LG TV. It receives AC power from your wall outlet and converts it to DC power to feed the other components of your TV.

### T-Con Board

The T-Con board, or the timing control board, regulates the timing of the signals that are sent to the LED/LCD panel. It ensures that the right colors are displayed at the right time.

Now, let's take a look at why you may have no picture but sound and backlight.

## What's Happening Inside Your LG TV?

There are a few things that could be happening inside your LG TV that's causing this problem. Let's explore some of them.

### Faulty T-Con Board

If your LG TV has no picture but sound and backlight, it could be due to a faulty T-Con board. The timing control signals that are sent to the LED/LCD panel may be disrupted or not functioning correctly, resulting in no picture or a distorted image.

### Faulty LED/LCD Panel

If your LG TV has no picture but sound and backlight, it could be due to a faulty LED/LCD panel. The pixels on the screen may not be lighting up correctly, resulting in no picture or a distorted image.

### Faulty Mainboard

If your LG TV has no picture but sound and backlight, it could be due to a faulty mainboard. The microprocessor or other circuitry on the board may be malfunctioning or not functioning correctly, resulting in no picture or a distorted image.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are several things that could be happening inside your LG TV that's causing no picture but sound and backlight. It could be due to a faulty T-Con board, faulty LED/LCD panel, or faulty mainboard. If you're experiencing this problem, it's best to contact a professional LG TV repair service to diagnose and fix the issue.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an LG 43UK6400. After a long vacation away, I returned home and turned on the TV. The TV worked fine for a couple of minutes and then the image disappeared. The sound works fine, and the backlight is lit. The remote also navigates the menu. I tried resetting, pulling the plug and waiting etc. I tried looking with a flashlight to see if there is an image, but there isn’t. I have opened up the TV and haven’t seen any visually identifiable defects in the power supply or the main board. I saw online that there is a common connectivity issue where some pins of the ribbon cable will be defective, and putting tape on the ribbon cable will solve it. However, I tried removing each ribbon cable separately to see if the image comes up on half of the screen, but it didn’t. Also, my TV seems like it doesn’t have what’s called a tcon board; the ribbon cables go from the main board to the screen directly. What do you think might be the problem?

 @gaspardgaston your T-con board is integrated onto the main board. Clarify how the picture disappears. Something like all of a sudden or fades or maybe from one side to the other.
Since you do not have an image visible via the “flashlight test” the very first suspect would be a bad main board since that is what produces the image etc. (very simplified). Yes, it can always be bad ribbon cables but it should not be the first suspect for this. Post another image, this time of the label to the left of the power board in picture number. That will most likely be the label for your display panel. Lets see if we can find a datasheet for that.
