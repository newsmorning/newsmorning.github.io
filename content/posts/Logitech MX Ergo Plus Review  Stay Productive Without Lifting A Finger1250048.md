# Revolutionize Your Workday with the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus - The Only Mouse You Need to Stay Productive without Lifting a Finger!

As technology continues to advance, so do the tools that we use to get our work done. From touch screens to voice-activated assistants, it's clear that the way we interact with our devices is constantly evolving. And when it comes to computer peripherals, ergonomics and productivity are two key factors that are always top of mind. That's why we're excited to introduce the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus, the only mouse you need to stay productive without lifting a finger!

## The Benefits of an Ergonomic Mouse

If you're someone who spends a lot of time working on a computer, you know how important it is to have a comfortable and ergonomic setup. When we spend hours clicking and scrolling, it can take a toll on our hands, wrists, and arms. An ergonomic mouse is designed to alleviate some of that strain, with features like a contoured shape and customizable buttons that can be programmed to streamline your workflow. And with the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus, you'll get all of those benefits and more.

## The Unique Design of the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus

The Logitech Mx Ergo Plus is unlike any other mouse on the market. At first glance, you'll notice that it has a unique shape that's specifically designed to reduce muscle strain and improve your posture. It has a trackball that's positioned at a 20-degree angle, which allows for a more natural hand and wrist position. Additionally, the mouse can be adjusted to your preferred angle, so you can find the perfect position that works for you.

## Customizable Buttons for a Customizable Workflow

But it's not just the shape of the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus that sets it apart. It also has eight customizable buttons that can be programmed to streamline your workflow. With the Logitech Options software, you can create custom macros and assign them to specific buttons, so you can work more efficiently without having to switch between different programs or apps. And since the mouse is wireless, you can use it from across the room and still have full control over your computer.

## A Mouse that Adapts to Your Needs

One of the best things about the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus is how it adapts to your needs. Whether you're a graphic designer, a programmer, or someone who just wants to be more productive, this mouse has features that can help you work smarter. The precision mode allows you to slow down the cursor and make more precise movements, while the scrolling wheel can switch between click-to-click scrolling and hyper-fast scrolling, depending on your needs.

## The Verdict: The Logitech Mx Ergo Plus is a Game-Changer

At the end of the day, the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus is a game-changer for anyone who wants to revolutionize their workday. With its ergonomic design, customizable buttons, and adaptable features, it's the only mouse you need to stay productive without lifting a finger. So whether you're a freelancer or a full-time employee, the Logitech Mx Ergo Plus is sure to become your new favorite tool for getting things done.

We purchased the Logitech MX Ergo Plus mouse so our reviewer could put it to the test. Keep reading for the full product review.

 

If you’ve ever been tempted by a trackball mouse, the Logitech MX Ergo Plus is the one to try for iPad owners. Users can switch between devices instantly with this programmable wireless mouse. Since trackball mice don’t need to move around, it can work just as well on a couch cushion as it can on a mouse pad. I tested the features of this mouse with my computer and iPad for 30 hours.

 
##   Design: Built for hands of any size  
 

The MX Ergo is made of durable plastic sculpted into an arch shape. The mouse rests on a magnetic base with a nonslip material on the bottom, preventing the mouse from moving around and eliminating the need for a mousepad. The magnetic base is also an adjustable hinge, which flips the mouse from the neutral position to a 20-degree angle.

 

There are six programmable buttons including the scroll wheel. The mouse requires no batteries and includes a recharging cable. There is no left-handed option for the MX Ergo, however.

 

Trackballs tend to accumulate a little grime that can make them track unevenly. This trackball is fitted into a recessed space, but it can be removed by pushing from the underside. Any mouse inevitably requires cleaning, so I’m glad the ball is easy to remove.

##   Performance: A mouse that can multitask  
 

Connecting the MX Ergo to my iPad Air was straightforward, requiring nothing more than the press of a button. Logitech Options is required to use this mouse with a computer, so I downloaded that as well. Once the MX Ergo Plus was connected to both, I could switch between the two by pressing the button on top of the mouse. Switching devices was quick, and the mouse maintained a great connection with both.

 

The buttons are quiet but not silent, and each set provides slightly different haptic feedback. I thought the buttons were pretty easy to reach. The trackball rolls smoothly under the slightest pressure from my thumb. The button for precision mode is beside the trackball, so it’s easy to turn on as needed.

Some people swear by trackballs for everything. I didn’t test the MX Ergo while gaming, but only because years of experience with trackballs taught me all I need to know about that. I would quit gaming before I used a trackball. For everything else, the MX Ergo Plus can compete with any mouse.

 
##   Comfort: Adjustable for all-day comfort  
 

It took a few minutes of experimentation to choose the best angle for the MX Ergo Plus. I personally preferred the neutral angle rather than the 20-degree one. My husband has a larger hand and different posture, and he preferred to use the mouse at an angle.

 

Becoming comfortable with the MX Ergo was mostly a matter of adapting to it. The arch shape provides nice palm support, so I held it just like any other mouse at first. My wrist was aching before long. I was used to holding a mouse and moving it around, so I had a death grip on the MX Ergo. This mouse isn’t going anywhere, so there was no need to hold it. Once I realized I could just relax, the MX Ergo was very comfortable.

I use a fingertip grip or a palm grip, depending on whether or not I’m reaching for the mouse between typing or resting my hand on the mouse while I browse the internet. Regardless of how I hold the mouse, all of the buttons are easy to reach. Using a lighter grip required some adjustment, but it’s also what makes the MX Ergo so comfortable.

 
##   Software: Logitech Options isn’t optional  
 

To use the MX Ergo Plus on my computer, I needed to download Logitech Options. Logitech accessories like keyboards and mice can be reprogrammed with this software. Using it to program the MX Ergo Plus was simple.

 

Logitech Options also enables Logitech Flow. With Logitech Flow, users can transfer data from one device to another without having to send it as an email attachment or use cloud services. For mice, that involves copying and pasting, or clicking and dragging. I couldn’t test it since Logitech Options isn’t available on iOS, but it’s a nice feature for accessories that can switch between devices.

 
##   Price: Worth a splurge  
 

The MX Ergo Plus is pricey for a computer accessory, but it is good enough to justify the $100 price tag. It is perfect for multi-device setups where a traditional mouse would cause problems, for example, while sitting on a couch.

 

Using a mouse on a couch is uncomfortable at best, but the MX Ergo Plus doesn’t need to move anywhere. It switches between devices instantaneously, and it’s extremely comfortable to use. If a trackball is the mouse of choice, then this one is worth every penny.

 
##   MX Ergo Trackball Plus vs. Magic Trackpad 2  
 

The MX Ergo Plus pairs well with iPads made within the past ten years. It’s comfortable to use for hours, and the battery goes over a month between charging. This mouse can be paired with two devices, and it switches instantly between them. Since it doesn’t need to move much, it’s great for simplifying your workspace. Trackballs aren’t for everyone, though.

 

Apple’s Magic Trackpad 2 is a great alternative. The trackpad is large, and its entire surface can be used to click or make gestures. Trackpads are comfortable for hours because they engage the entire hand in natural positions. The Magic Trackpad 2 has gestures specifically for iOS and macOS programs like Final Cut Pro. If you own multiple Apple devices, the Magic Trackpad 2 is a better choice.
