# Is Your MacBook Pro 15" Touch Bar Not Working? Get Windows Support & Bootcamp Drivers Now!

Many MacBook Pro 15" users switch between macOS and Windows. While macOS works flawlessly, Windows requires some work to get it working perfectly. Sometimes, the MacBook Pro 15" Touch Bar stops working on the Windows side. This is a common problem faced by many MacBook Pro 15" users. Fortunately, there are ways to fix it.

## Step 1: Update Windows OS

The first step is to ensure that your Windows OS is up to date. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and click Check for updates. If there are any updates available, download and install them.

## Step 2: Update Bootcamp Drivers

Apple releases Bootcamp drivers to optimize Windows performance on Mac hardware. Make sure that you have the latest Bootcamp drivers installed. Go to the Apple menu on macOS, choose Software Update, and install any available updates.

## Step 3: Check Touch Bar Settings

The Touch Bar on MacBook Pro 15" is customizable. Sometimes, the settings can interfere with its performance. Go to the Bootcamp Control Panel in Windows and click on Touch Bar. Make sure that the Enable Touch Bar option is selected. If it is not, enable it.

## Step 4: Disable Third-Party Antivirus

Third-party antivirus apps can interfere with Windows performance. Some antivirus apps cause issues with the Touch Bar. Try to disable any third-party antivirus apps temporarily in Windows to see if that resolves the problem.

## Step 5: Reset the Touch Bar

If none of the above steps work, reset the Touch Bar. To reset the Touch Bar, shut down your MacBook Pro 15" and hold down the Command + Option + P + R keys when you press the power button. Keep holding those keys until you hear the startup sound twice. Release the keys and let your MacBook Pro 15" startup normally.

## Step 6: Contact Windows Support

If the above steps do not work, contact Windows Support. Explain the issue you are facing, and they may be able to provide a solution.

## Conclusion

The MacBook Pro 15" Touch Bar not working on Windows can be a frustrating experience. However, there are several ways to fix the problem. Make sure that your Windows OS and Bootcamp drivers are up to date, check Touch Bar settings, disable third-party antivirus, reset the Touch Bar, or contact Windows Support. With a little patience and some troubleshooting, you can get your Touch Bar back to working order in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I have this MBP and the bootcamp software will not function properly.
I’ve tested, and since removed, a windows 10 install outside of the bootcamp software and it works flawlessly, only I cannot find the driver software and BootCamp fails when trying to download support software or even when I try to use BootCamp to install Windows.
I’ve tried basically everything and now just a need a link to the support software (Drivers) or a  kind person to send me the files so I can install them on my Windows side.

 I’m assuming you are still using Win10 on your MBP.  I can’t find BCD (BootCampDrivers) for you from Apple that are for Win10, but I did find them for Win8.  It might get you a stretch forward so maybe give them a try if you are feeling adventurous.  This is the latest version they have easily searchable on their support site.

FWIW, I hate Boot Camp Assistant because it’s a troll IMO.
