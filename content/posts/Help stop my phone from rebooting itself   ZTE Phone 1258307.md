## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I'm seriously becoming frustrated with my phone.
I've been trying to root my Sonata 3 Z832 Android phone with Kingroot app recently.
While I do understand the risks this poses, I would like full control over my phone.
During the root, the Cricket Wireless ZTE turns itself off then on stopping the progress at various stages of root.
I was able to root it successfully once, but before I could uninstall the Kingroot and install the Supersu, my phone rebooted and the root failed.. AGAIN!
For about a week, I've been researching online for an answer, but  unfortunately I have found no one to help me.
Is there a tech geek who is willing and can seriously help me, who also knows US English contact me please.
Here is my email: rariley129@gmail.com

 Sorry to say, But I have not found any way to root this phone. I have the same phone and have tried every root system that says it can root the phone but none have worked. I have pretty much given up on rooting this phone. I do not know if it is Cricket that has something done or if  it is  just something in the phone.
Sorry could not be more helpful.
