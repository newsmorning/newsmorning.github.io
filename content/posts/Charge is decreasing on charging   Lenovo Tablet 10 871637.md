If you're a Lenovo Tablet 10 user or planning to get one, be aware of the shocking discovery of losing battery life while charging. Some users experienced this problem, including a sudden drop to 0% despite plugging it in for hours. Here's what happened, and what you need to know to avoid potential problems.

**What happened?**

Lenovo Tablet 10 users reported that their devices lost battery life or failed to charge properly while connected to a charger. This problem happened regardless of the charging method, whether using the original adapter or a third-party charger or cable. Some users also experienced overheating, which indicated a problem with the device's battery.

**Possible causes**

The Lenovo Tablet 10 has a built-in battery that powers the device, and like any rechargeable battery, it has a limited lifespan. Over time, the battery loses its ability to hold a charge, and you may notice a decrease in the device's battery performance. However, this problem may also be caused by a faulty charging system or cable, which prevents the battery from properly charging or regulating the current flow. Another possible reason is a software problem that affects the battery's charging cycles, triggering a malfunction.

**How to avoid potential problems**

If you're already experiencing problems with your Lenovo Tablet 10's battery life, follow these steps to prevent further damage:

* Stop using the device while charging until you've resolved the issue to avoid overheating or other potential problems.
* Use the original charger and cable that came with your Lenovo Tablet 10 to ensure compatibility and safe charging.
* If using a third-party charger or cable, make sure it's reliable, tested, and compatible with your device.
* Always keep your device upgraded with the latest software versions, as new updates often contain bug fixes and performance improvements.

**What to do if your device has a problem**

If your Lenovo Tablet 10 is experiencing problems with battery life or charging, try these steps to resolve the issue:

* First, try resetting your device to its factory settings to rule out any software glitches. This will erase all your files and settings, so back up your data before you proceed.
* Check the battery performance by accessing the device's battery settings. If you notice a significant drop in battery capacity or charging time, replace the battery.
* Bring your device to an authorized service center or contact Lenovo support for further assistance. They may examine the device and perform necessary repairs or replacements.

Don't take your Lenovo Tablet 10 battery life for granted. Regularly check your device's performance to avoid potential problems, and don't hesitate to seek help if you notice any issues. With the proper care and attention, your device can serve you well for years to come.

 Power problem not chraging

 This is probably not an issue with the tablet itself, this is probably the charger youâ€™re using. Try using the charger provided by the manufacturer or use a different cable/adapter.
