Title: You Won't Believe How This Simple Trick Fixes Misshapen A1181 Batteries - 3rd Party Battery Hack Revealed!

Introduction:
Are you also one of the many MacBook owners who are suffering from misshapen A1181 batteries? If yes, then you’re in for a treat because a 3rd party battery hack might just be your saving grace. No longer will you have to shell out hundreds of dollars for a new battery or have to deal with the dreaded “Service Battery” warning. Read on to find out the simple trick that can fix this problem.

Body:
First, let's discuss what causes A1181 battery misshaping. These batteries are made to fit snugly in the MacBook but incorrect installation or a bump in the laptop can cause the battery to bend out of shape. When this happens, the metal plates inside the battery become warped, and the battery does not hold the charge correctly anymore. 

But before you think about buying a new battery, try out this trick that can help you fix your misshapen A1181 battery.

You'll need a flat bench or a table, a soft cloth, and a flat object. Here's how you can fix your misshapen battery:

1. Lay the cloth over the bench or table.
2. Place the misshapen battery on the cloth.
3. Place the flat object (example: book, cutting board) on the battery.
4. Apply pressure by pushing down on the object for about 15 seconds.
5. Remove the object and the cloth.

That's it! You'll be amazed at how this simple trick can fix your misshapen A1181 battery.

This trick is a lifesaver for those who are on a budget or who prefer not to use 3rd party batteries. However, if the battery is severely damaged and can't hold a charge, or if you see bulging or leaking, then it's time to replace the battery.

Conclusion:
Don't let a misshapen A1181 battery prevent you from using your MacBook. With this simple trick, you can fix most misshapen batteries quickly and efficiently. Just remember to be gentle and not apply too much pressure as it may cause further damage. Give this a try, and let us know if this hack worked for you!

And, how to you select a proper 3rd party battery? All of those I have found are very low quality, and fail after some 20-30 cycles.
