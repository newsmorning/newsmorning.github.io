Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When Your iPhone 5C Home Button Stops Working After a Battery Replacement!

Intro: As iPhone users, we all have faced the frustration of a drained battery. But what happens when you replace your iPhone 5C battery and your home button stops working? This can be a nightmare for anyone who relies on their iPhone for communication and work. Here, we explore the issue and potential solutions to help you get back to using your device without any issues.

Background: The iPhone 5C was a popular entry-level iPhone model that was released in 2013. It had a 4-inch display, a plastic shell, and a home button at the bottom, which also serves as a fingerprint scanner. It was released with iOS 7 and received updates till iOS 10.3.4, which was the last official update for the device.

Issue: Some iPhone 5C users have reported that after replacing the battery on their device, the home button stops working. This can be frustrating, as the home button is essential for navigating the phone and accessing important features. The issue seems to be related to the replacement battery, as the home button works fine before the battery replacement.

Reasons: The issue seems to be related to the way the iPhone 5C's home button works. Apart from being a physical button, it also contains a fingerprint sensor and a capacitive touch sensor. The capacitive touch sensor detects when a finger is placed on the button and activates the fingerprint scanner. If there is a problem with the capacitive touch sensor, the home button might not work correctly.

Solutions: There are a few things you can try if your iPhone 5C's home button stops working after a battery replacement. Firstly, try calibrating the home button. To do this, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home button and follow the instructions. This might help solve the issue if it's related to calibration.

If that doesn't work, try restoring your iPhone to its factory settings. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings. This will wipe your device clean, so it's essential to back up your data before doing this. This method might solve the issue if it's related to a software bug.

If neither of the above methods works, it might be time to take your device to a professional repair shop. They will be able to diagnose the issue correctly and come up with a solution. It's essential to take your device to a reputable repair shop to avoid any further damage to your phone.

Conclusion: It can be frustrating when your iPhone 5C's home button stops working after a battery replacement. However, there are a few things you can try to solve the issue yourself. If all else fails, take your device to a professional repair shop. With these tips, you'll be able to get your phone back to working condition in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 Replaced battery and now home button is not working even if I short the 2 pins. It is definitely the motherboard that's faulty as I tried another and it was fine. Compared both motherboards and can't see any damaged components. Any help would be appreciated.

 Hi ,
It's one of two subjects , first is the charging flat or it's about tiny things located beside the charging flat connector on board , there is no other reason
