Introduction
If you've ever had to replace the cable on your MacBook Air screen, you might have faced a big problem after the job - your screen goes dark! It's a common problem, but it can be frustrating when you don't know what to do. Thankfully, there's a solution that you've been searching for, and we're here to help you out.

The problem
So, you've replaced your MacBook Air screen cable, and now your screen is dark. What could be the problem? In most cases, this occurs due to a compatibility issue. Most MacBook Air models have slightly different cable configurations, and as such, the replacement cable you've chosen might not be a perfect match with your device. That can cause the screen to go dark, or even worse, it won't show any display at all.

The solution
There's an easy fix for this problem - a reset of NVRAM. NVRAM stands for Non-volatile Random Access Memory, and it stores certain settings on your MacBook Air that you can change, like the volume, the resolution, screen dimming, and even the time. A reset of the NVRAM is an effective way of fixing the dark screen problem on your MacBook Air after a replacement cable.

How to reset NVRAM 
Before you reset the NVRAM, ensure that your MacBook Air is switched off. Once you're sure the device is off, follow these steps:

1. Locate the Command + Option + P + R keys on your keyboard.
2. Press and hold these four keys at once.
3. Turn on your MacBook Air, then wait for it to restart and you hear the startup sound twice.
4. Release the keys you're holding.

That's it! Your MacBook Air screen should light up and display correctly. If it doesn't, you might have to seek the help of a professional repair technician who specializes in MacBook Air repairs.

Conclusion
Having a dark screen on your MacBook Air after a cable replacement can be frustrating, but it's usually a compatibility issue that is quickly and easily solved with an NVRAM reset. Follow the steps above carefully to reset NVRAM and get your MacBook Air up and running as before. If the problem persists or if you're not comfortable making the repair yourself, seek the services of a professional repair technician. Remember, tinkering with your device's components can lead to additional issues if not done correctly, so be sure to take the proper precautions.

 Hello,
I have done a lot of reading on this problem so far and it keeps landing me a possible fuse problem but I am having a problem find the correct fuse that may need to be replaced.
I will give you a little background on how this started for me. I got this Air from a family member and it had broken hinges I replaced all the hinge pieces including the LCD cable. When I powered it on I got a white screen so I though it may be another bad LCD cable because I read that was the common problem. So I purchased another cable and same situation. I was messing around with the cable while the power was on to see if the connection was loose and the screen went black. After that happened I assumed I blew out the driver for the LCD screen on the actual screen. I bought another screen powered the laptop and the screen works again, but no back light now. So after some reading I found out it could be a possible fuse, I got a hold of A1304 wiring diagram and narrowed it down to a few possibilities which I am having trouble finding on the motherboard. My question is could someone help me find the proper fuse I may need to replace so I can get the back light working again. Also if anyone know of any other good  possibly solutions besides a fuse that may need to be replaced please let me know.
I have posted pictures and the A1304 wiring diagram,   please refer to pages 59-63 in the diagram for the LCD pages.

Please any help is greatly appreciated, I have posted on here before about the same laptop and received good help.
Thanks,
Roy

 Roy, looks like a  A1304 - EMC 2253 Late 2008. The fuse is underneath the cloth tape. Remove that to reveal the backlight fuse reference designator F9800. It is a 2AMP-32V fuse in a 0402-HF package. Since you do have the schematic, I will only list the components that you should check on:
U9750 Backlight Driver located on the under side of the board. can not mark its location since I do not have an image of the bottom side. If you want to post that with your question, we can point it out to you as well
F9800 Backlight fuse
Q9806 Power FET
Q9807 Field Effect Transistor N Channel MOS Type


Always remember, there is a reason why fuses blow. Make sure that you have no other power issues with your board. Hope this helps, good luck

 Hello,
Maybe an answer here

 just to say thanks ....
my is working again but i like to  ad that you need to exchange the cable lcd-logic board this the reason to kill the fuse.
ps i didnt have a same fuse but i add a good one and dont take off the bad . i will pos a foto. i i think it will more easy to all.alternatine fuse replace imac backlight
and again thanks to all
cheers
sorry for the bad english

 Que tal PEDRO, tengo un Macbook Air a1237 con el mismo problema, has de cuenta que si se ve la imagen en el display pero muy tenue apenas se alcanza a ver con una lampara como si fuese el inverter, las bisagras habrán dañado el cable? que me recomiendas, saludos.
Heyy PEDRO, I have a Macbook Air A1237 with the same problem, you have to realize that if you see the image on the display, but very faint barely manages to see a lamp as if the inverter, hinges have damaged the cable? I recommend you, greetings. (sorry bad english)

 hello from Portugal :) HUGO..
well yours like my don't have lamp its LED so you will not find that extra lamp cable..
its all in LCD cable ..it appears that cables break internally make some short circuit and kill the fuse its a good practice to exchange the cable if that happens .
if it was mine i replace the fuse, change cable and clean all the machine, and put some new heat past in cpu/gpu....
buena sorte...
