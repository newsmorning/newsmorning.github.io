# Transform Your Slow Surface Pro into a Lightning-Fast Beast: Upgrade Your RAM and Enjoy A High-Performing Laptop!

If you own a Surface Pro and you are frustrated with its slow performance, then there is something you can do to turn it into a high-performing laptop. The key is to upgrade your RAM, which can be an easy and affordable solution to improve the speed and responsiveness of your device.

In this article, we will discuss the benefits of upgrading your RAM and the steps you can take to make your Surface Pro lightning-fast. So, let's get started!

## What is RAM?

RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that stores data and instructions temporarily. It is different from hard drive storage, which stores data permanently. RAM is faster than hard drives, so when you have more RAM, your computer can run more programs and perform tasks more quickly.

## Why Upgrade Your Surface Pro's RAM?

If your Surface Pro is running slow, it might be because it doesn't have enough RAM to handle the tasks you are trying to perform. Adding more RAM can speed up your Surface Pro and reduce the time it takes to complete tasks such as running multiple programs, editing large files, or surfing the web.

Upgrading your RAM is also an excellent way to future-proof your device. As new apps and software require more resources, having more RAM will ensure that your Surface Pro can run them smoothly.

## How to Upgrade Your Surface Pro's RAM

Upgrading your Surface Pro's RAM is a simple process that can be done in a few steps:

1. Check your Surface Pro's specifications to see what RAM modules it supports. You can find this information on the Microsoft website or in your device manual.

2. Purchase the correct RAM module for your Surface Pro. You can find compatible RAM modules online or at your local tech store.

3. Turn off your Surface Pro and unplug it from the power source.

4. Locate the RAM compartment on your Surface Pro. This is usually located on the back of the device or under the kickstand.

5. Remove the screws that secure the RAM compartment.

6. Carefully remove the existing RAM module from the device.

7. Insert the new RAM module into the RAM slot, making sure it is properly seated.

8. Replace the screws and close the RAM compartment.

9. Turn on your Surface Pro and check the new RAM module is detected in your device settings.

Congratulations! You've successfully upgraded your Surface Pro's RAM.

## Conclusion

If you want to transform your slow Surface Pro into a lightning-fast beast, then upgrading your RAM is the way to go. It can improve your device's performance, speed up its processing time, and allow you to multitask without any lag.

The process is easy, affordable, and can be done in just a few steps. So why not give your Surface Pro the boost it deserves and enjoy a high-performing laptop today!

## Chosen Solution
 Can I add or switch the RAM in a microsoft pro laptop?
If so any suggestions?

 Hi @swellington ,
If you meant the Surface Pro model then the ram cannot be upgraded as it is hard mounted onto the motherboard.
Hereâ€™s the ifixit Microsoft Surface Pro Teardown guide. Go to Step.14 to see the location of the ram on the motherboard.
If you meant other Surface Pro models e.g. Pro 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, X etc) then looking at the other ifixit Surface Pro model guides it seems to be the same with all of them i.e. non removable.
