Have you ever experienced the frustration of trying to watch your favorite show on your LG TV, only to realize that the screen is barely visible? As frustrating as this can be, there is actually a simple trick to help fix this issue.

Before we dive into the solution, it's important to understand why this issue is occurring. In most cases, the main reason for a barely visible LG TV screen is due to the brightness settings being too low. This can happen over time as the TV's brightness settings are automatically adjusted based on the viewing environment. For example, if you primarily use your TV at night, the brightness may be set accordingly, but if you suddenly watch during the day, the existing settings may not work well.

Now, let's reveal the simple trick to fix this issue. It’s important to note that this solution may not work for all LG TV models, but it is worth trying.

The first step is to press the settings button on your remote control. From there, navigate to the picture settings menu. This menu should contain multiple settings like color, contrast, and brightness.

Now, look for the “Expert Controls” (or similar) setting and select it. Within this menu, look for a setting called “Dynamic Contrast” and turn it off. This should automatically adjust the brightness levels to a more reasonable level.

If this doesn't work, try manually adjusting the brightness levels within the picture settings menu. You can make adjustments incrementally until you find the perfect level for your viewing situation.

Another solution is to check the ambient light in the room where you use your TV. If the TV is facing a window with incoming sunlight or situated in a bright room, consider adjusting your setup to avoid direct light onto the screen. You can also invest in curtains or blinds to block out the light completely or use an anti-glare screen protector.

In conclusion, a poorly visible LG TV screen can be frustrating, but it's important to remember there are simple solutions. By adjusting the brightness settings, making changes to the viewing environment, and seeking the right ambient light, you can find the perfect solution to get the best viewing experience. Don't let the frustration of a sub-optimal TV experience ruin your entertainment time.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi guys
I just turned on my tv the LG startup logo was nice and bright then when it went away the tv screen was very dim. Can someone  help me please

 Hi,
Here’s a composite image of the No video- Normal Audio troubleshooting procedure, taken from the TV service manual that shows what and where to test.
The manual is awkward to use online as you have to enter the page number in the box below the document and click Go every time that you want to change a page. To download it though, you need to sign up to the website.

(click on the magnifying glass in the image and then when it opens in a new page click on the image again to enlarge for better viewing)
Apologies for the small image. I’ve typed the relevant page numbers in “red” (p.90, 92 & 110) on each of the pages in the image, so it may be easier to go directly to the page in the manual by entering the page number in the box below the document box.
Hopefully a start.
