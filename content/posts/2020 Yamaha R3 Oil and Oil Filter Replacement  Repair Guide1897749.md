# Rev Up Your Ride and Avoid Costly Repairs with This Essential 2020 Yamaha R3 Oil and Oil Filter Replacement Guide!

As a proud owner of a 2020 Yamaha R3 motorcycle, you’re likely aware of the importance of regular maintenance to keep your ride running smoothly and last longer. One of the most critical aspects of maintaining your bike is performing regular oil and oil filter changes. The oil lubricates your engine, preventing wear and tear on the internal components and keeping it running optimally. Over time, oil breaks down and loses its ability to protect the engine, so it’s crucial to replace it periodically. Here’s a guide on how to perform an oil and oil filter replacement on your 2020 Yamaha R3.

## Tools and Materials Needed

Before starting, gather the following tools and materials:

- Motorcycle stand or lift
- Socket wrench
- Oil filter wrench
- Drain pan
- New oil filter
- Yamaha Genuine Oil Filter OEM Part# 5DM-E3145-00
- Yamaha Genuine Yamalube 10W-40 All Purpose Oil for YMA FS + HS Part# LUB10W40AP12 
- Funnel

## Steps for Replacing the Oil and Oil Filter

1. Place the motorcycle on the stand or lift to provide easier access to the engine and drain plug.

2. Remove the oil filter cover by unscrewing the bolt in the center.

3. Place the drain pan under the engine.

4. Using a socket wrench, loosen the drain plug located on the bottom of the engine.

5. Allow the oil to drain entirely into the pan.

6. Remove the old oil filter by using an oil filter wrench.

7. Apply a small amount of clean oil to the gasket on the new oil filter.

8. Install the new oil filter, then tighten it securely by hand, being careful not to overtighten or cross-thread.

9. Replace the oil filter cover, then tighten the bolt in the center.

10. Fill the engine with the recommended oil. Yamaha recommends using Yamalube 10W-40 All Purpose Oil for YMA FS + HS.

11. Use a funnel to avoid spills while pouring in the oil.

12. Check the oil level using the dipstick, and add more oil if necessary to reach the recommended level.

13. Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to circulate the new oil.

14. Turn the engine off and let it cool down for a few minutes.

15. Check the oil level once again and add more if necessary.

16. Dispose of the used oil and oil filter properly, according to your local regulations.

By following these steps, you can maintain your 2020 Yamaha R3 motorcycle and prevent costly repairs caused by neglected maintenance. We recommend checking the manufacturer’s instructions for recommended oil change intervals, which typically range from 3,000 to 7,500 miles, depending on driving conditions. Remember to always use high-quality oil and filters for the best performance and protection of your engine. Happy riding!

Step 5


 
- 
 - Hold your bike up straight to view the oil lines on the side of the bike.
 - 
 - There are two lines: the bottom line indicates low oil and the top line indicates full oil.
 - 
 - Let the bike run for a few minutes to allow oil to flow through bike. After this, you may need to add more oil.
 - 
 - A bike with no oil is just as bad as a bike with too much oil. Make sure the oil is to the top of the second line and no higher.
