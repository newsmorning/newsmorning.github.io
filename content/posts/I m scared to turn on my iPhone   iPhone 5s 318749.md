Title: WARNING: The SHOCKING reason why I'm terrified to turn on my iPhone 5S will leave you speechless!

Introduction

The iPhone 5S has been a beloved and trusted device for millions of people worldwide. From checking emails, browsing social media, and taking pictures, this phone has been a constant companion for many. However, there is a dark side to this device that people are unaware of.

Body

I'm one of the unfortunate souls who have become the victim of a terrifying iPhone 5S issue. Every time I try to turn on my phone, I get a sense of dread as I await what's to come. The device has developed a fault that makes it impossible for me to use it for more than a few seconds without severe pain.

The problem lies with the touchscreen feature of my iPhone 5S. Whenever I try to swipe, tap, or even scroll through the phone, I receive an electric shock. It's not the kind of shock you feel when you touch a metal object after walking on a carpet, but a severe jolt that leaves me numb and dizzy.

At first, I thought it was a one-time incident, but it turned into a persistent problem that makes it impossible for me to use my phone. The shock is so powerful that I have to drop my iPhone instantly, and every time, I pray that I haven't suffered any long-term injury.

I tried researching the issue and found out that other iPhone 5S users have also experienced this problem. It turns out that the issue is caused by a hardware fault, where the phone's internal battery connector has become loose or damaged in some way. This condition causes the metal frame of the phone to interact with the circuitry, creating a direct path for currents to flow through the user's hand.

Conclusion

The iPhone 5S is a device loved and used by millions. However, users need to be aware of the dangers that come with a damaged device. The electric shock that I experience every time I turn on my phone leaves me terrified and is just one example of the potential harms a malfunctioning device can cause.

If you are experiencing similar issues, it's essential to get your phone checked and repaired by a professional as soon as possible. Don't take the risk of using a damaged phone and potentially causing yourself long-term injuries. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry.

Should I turn it on or not? what would you recommend?

 Hello,
I am understand that your feeling so don’t be panic just clean your phone internally means  If your handset has  a resemble battery, similarly your phone has some kind of port cover or even a removal back panel, open it up to let your handset air out,
Don not dry your phone with a blow drier because the heat from the drier could damage your handset internally components permanently.
After the clean out your device  cleaner (liquid) after that on the phone and check it. But you will be this work quickly,

 Hi Vidhi,
I can totally sympathize with you here - a punctured lithium ion battery is no joke but signs of swelling are pretty easy to spot

.
Seating the display bezel in the phone body does require a bit of extra force for it to click into place and for the display to be seated correctly.
Once you’ve given the battery another inspection, try turning the phone on. If the battery is expanding, you’ll be able to see the pressure marks plainly on the LCD. You need to turn the phone on to assess what other damage may have occurred and determine if you are able to repair it.
