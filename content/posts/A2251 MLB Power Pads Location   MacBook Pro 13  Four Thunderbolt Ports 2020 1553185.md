 A2251 MLB Power Pads Location
Good morning all!
Can anyone advise where the location of the power on pads on A2251 MLB?
Working on a liquid damaged unit and the board is clean (front and back), i suspect the top case is at fault and need to bypass power button using power on pads on MLB.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Kind Regards,Harry

 At far as I know none of the TouchID based systems offer power pads. All require   the TouchID button connected (and working)
If you have a bare board, plug in a charger (bench power supply) using a USB-C power meter in-line with your power you should get a better idea on what’s happening. Take the time to visit Louis Rossmann’s YouTube channel as he gets deep into logic board repairs.
