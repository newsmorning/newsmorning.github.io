For those on the go constantly, a portable mouse for a laptop or an ultrabook is an essential tool. Those who might be interested in keeping cordless might be interested in trying a new option: a Bluetooth enabled mouse. The Logitech T630, released back in 2013, is still relevant today. Using Bluetooth technology, the mouse combines this modern feature with a sleek design for a solid travel mouse. Read on for our thoughts on design, performance, and comfort.

 
##   Design: Beautiful build   
 

Arguably, this is one of the most beautiful mice on the market. A sleek, black design with a steel grey band around the middle, the mouse looks like something out of a science fiction film. It’s even thinner than some laptop models, ours included, at 5.4 x 1.7 x 4.1 inches (LWH). Small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, its thin design makes it great for slipping it into a laptop bag pocket or even a jean pocket if you’re really pressed for time. Because it’s Bluetooth enabled, the bottom of the mouse has two-channel options, as well as a charging port and a power button. 

 

Besides the Bluetooth feature, one of the best features of the mouse is the lithium-ion battery which replaces AA or AAA battery requirements. Our only gripe about the design of the mouse is that if the PC doesn’t have Bluetooth capabilities, then the mouse will not work. On the flip side, though, while most mice require you to sacrifice a USB port, this one leaves an extra USB port open for charging phones or adding other accessories.

 
A plus side to this mouse is that it’s ambidextrous, allowing anyone with Windows software to be able to enjoy this new level of comfort.
 
##   Setup Process: Charge it first  
 

Setting up the Logitech T630 mouse proved to be a hassle. The mouse comes with a handy booklet that assists the user with getting it set up, which we used. Start by turning on the laptop’s Bluetooth settings and well as the mouse. If you don’t power up the mouse, it won’t register it. 

 

You’ll have to scan for the Bluetooth device, which can take up to a minute to find. However, if it still can’t find it, as we discovered, check the barely visible dot on the top of the mouse. If it’s not flashing, then you have a bigger problem: the mouse needs charging. It took us forever to set this mouse up because we assumed that the mouse came pre-charged—it doesn’t. After 1.5 hours it’ll be fully charged, but one minute of charging allows the mouse to work for an hour if you’re in a pinch. 

 

Once we had some life in the mouse, Bluetooth registered, and within seconds, we were connected and ready to go.

 
Our only gripe about the design of the mouse is that if the PC doesn’t have Bluetooth capabilities, then the mouse will not work.
 
##   Performance: Eight touch-controlled buttons shine  
 

The biggest claim to Logitech fame in the T630 mouse isn’t the design or the price tag; it’s the sensor technology incorporated into the mouse. A buttonless interface contributes to the design, but in terms of performance, the mouse really shines on this all-touch surface. 

 

With a double-tap of two fingers, you can pull up the app menu, giving the T630 an edge against traditional mice. An added perk: simply swiping left and right allows the user to shift between apps, making this a great addition for anyone using tablets or ultrabooks. For those using regular laptops, while those features won’t necessarily be enabled, especially if you don’t focus on app-related use, the other touch and swiping features that make the mouse will still be solid. Once it’s in a laptop setting, those same touch controls swap to back and forth buttons. It’s a really awesome feature if you need to swap between internet pages but don’t want to open two separate panels.

 

The rest of the nine touch motion sensors are standard for mice: left buttons, right buttons, middle buttons, and the scrolling wheel. Everything about this mouse feels smooth, you’re simply relaxing and using natural, fluid motions. Better yet, everything we tried to do with the mouse was for the most part without hitches, proving that it really knows what you’re doing when you position your hand on the top interface and scroll. It’s a refreshing take on a travel mouse, and if we didn’t game so much we would probably make this our main. That said, for the people who like to game on the go, this will suffice, but if you’re used to a gamer’s mouse, don’t expect any grandiose revelations with the Logitech. It’ll help you with the basics, but that’s pretty much it.

 

Our only concern in terms of performance with the Logitech was the scrolling button. It felt jerky, even with optimal settings on the Control Panel. A few minutes after installation, a Logitech screen popped up and offered to install a smooth scrolling app designed for its mice. We took up its offer to see whether it would help. While it definitely gives you more precise control over scrolling, the mouse still scrolls very quickly. A simple twitch of the finger will get you further down the page; flicking it sends the page scrambling for the top or bottom. If you need to scroll fast, though this is the mouse for you.

##   Comfort: Barely there  
 

The thickest point of this mouse lies where you would rest your palm, at 1.7 inches. Amazingly, the mouse slims down to just over 0.5 inches where your fingers would rest. This helps keep your hands in a more natural, curved position. A plus side to this mouse is that it’s ambidextrous, allowing anyone with Windows software to be able to enjoy this new level of comfort.

 
##   Battery Life: Could be better  
 

On a 1.5-hour battery charge, the mouse lasts for up to 10 days thanks to a rechargeable, lithium-ion battery. It’s really nice in that you’re not constantly having to swap out AA or AAA batteries in the mouse. However, 10 days is a little low. Consider this: some of the older, battery-reliant travel mice can operate on two AA batteries for up to six months, while others can last up to 15 months on one AA battery. Knowing this, the 10 days battery life is a little unreasonable. It’s true this is an older mouse, but we still expected that the battery to last longer than it does.

 
##   Price: Top of the price range  
 

For the whopping price of $170 for Macs or $225 for Windows, this mouse can be a part of your travel. It’s definitely at the high of the budget, especially when there are other models out there that retail for as low as $10. Basically, for the price, you’re paying for a fancy design that comes with Bluetooth and app capabilities.

 
##   Logitech T630 vs. Microsoft Arc Touch  
 

For starters, the Logitech’s high price really struggles to compete with the cost of the more economic $45 the Arc Touch wants for its foldable mouse. For those who need a non-Bluetooth mouse, the Arc Touch also offers a USB port, complete with a magnetic grip to secure it to the mouse during travel. While these all sound like really good features, the real kicker is that the mouse can run for six months on two AAA batteries.

 

While this all seems like it’s in favor of the Arc Touch, not so fast—the Logitech’s smooth, flat design makes it a more comfortable handgrip. It’s also small enough to pack into a back pocket, which is really nice if you’re rushed to make it to a meeting on time. And the real perk of the T630 is that when you’re pressed for USB space, it connects automatically with the Bluetooth settings. If you’re looking for something more portable and tech-friendly, then the Logitech T630 is definitely the better choice. However, if the cost and compatibility are more ideal, then swap to the more budget-friendly Microsoft Arc Touch.

 
The best on the market, but it comes at a high price.
