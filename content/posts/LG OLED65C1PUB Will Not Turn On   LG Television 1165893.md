# Is Your LG OLED65C1Pub Dead? Discover The Shocking Reason Why It Won't Turn On!

So, you've invested in the LG OLED65C1Pub Smart TV, and now, it's refusing to turn on? The situation can be frustrating, especially when you are in the middle of binge-watching your favourite show.

If you are experiencing an LG OLED65C1Pub that's refusing to turn on, don't panic. In this article, we'll provide a comprehensive guide to help you determine what could be causing the problem and how to fix it.

## Check Your Power Connection

One of the leading causes of LG OLED65C1Pub not turning on could be a loose power connection. Ensure your power cord is securely plugged into the TV and the wall outlet. You can also try unplugging the TV for a few minutes and plugging it back into the power source.

## Check for a Power Surge

Power outages or a sudden power surge can cause some electronic devices, like the LG OLED65C1Pub, to stop working. Sometimes, the TV's built-in surge protection system becomes overworked, and the TV may refuse to turn on.

You can try the following steps to fix this issue:

1. Unplug the TV and all other devices connected to the power source.
2. Wait for a few minutes before plugging the TV and other devices back in.
3. Turn the TV back on and see if the issue persists.

## Check for a Faulty Remote Control or Power Button

Sometimes, the issue may not be with your LG OLED65C1Pub TV but with the remote control or power button. The battery in your remote may be dead, causing it to become unresponsive. If this is the case, try replacing the battery.

Alternatively, the power button on your TV may be faulty. You can try pressing and holding the power button on the TV to see if it responds. If not, it may need to be repaired.

## Check for a Software Glitch

Sometimes, software glitches can cause electronic devices to malfunction. Your LG OLED65C1Pub TV might be experiencing a software glitch that's preventing it from turning on.

Here's what you can do:

1. Unplug the TV from the power source.
2. Wait for ten seconds before plugging it back into the power source.
3. Press the power button on the TV to turn it on.

If the TV still doesn't turn on, try resetting it to its default factory settings.

## Contact LG Customer Service

If all else fails, you can contact LG customer service for assistance. They have well-trained technicians who can diagnose the problem and provide a solution.

In addition, you can also contact the store where you purchased the TV for assistance. They may have a return policy that can facilitate the replacement of a faulty device.

In conclusion, encountering an LG OLED65C1Pub that won't turn on can be frustrating, but these steps can help you fix the problem. Always remember to check your power connection, remote control or power button, power surge, and software glitches before seeking expert help.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an LG OLED TV with the same issue. I didn't think to try the input cables, so I tried, and found the same thing. Click, power on, lines. The lines make it look like the panel is shot. But, I'm not sure what it means that when the cables are reattached, the display refuses to turn on entirely. Sorry that I am just now finding this. I also have no financial commitment to this TV, but I wonder if a new cable would help. Were you ever able to find out anything new regarding this?

 @scsicat all the symptoms you describe and the image of the bottom left corner sure looks like a broken LCD. A missing cable would not result in a split line or a short line.
