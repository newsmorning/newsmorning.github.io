## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
since two weeks ago, our TV (28months old) stated to reboot itself for no reason. It was getting more frequent, so today we have decided to do factory reset. Once the TV turned on for initial set up, on the scree where you have to confirm language and location, the TV turns off. And thats it. I can not do anything else, except this endless loop. I was trying to upgrade SW, however the TV doesnâ€™t recognise the USB while in initial setup. Also I tried all unplug/10/30 seconds power button, changing batteries in remote. Nothing helps.
Any idea?

 The easiest fix is to unplug TV, press the power button 50 or more times. (I did 100 after a cross-country move), plug the TV back in and you should be good to go. This worked on two different TVs, both of which had heavy static buildup after our cross-country move.
This is a well-known issue with desktop PCs that has worked for me for decades when they experience boot loops.

 @bluephantas  in general these start and restarts etc. are commonly caused by failed MOSFETS on the main board. Of course we need more details as outlined above from you to be more precise

 My issue sounds similar. So get this. I have a 5 year old LG 55ga7900. My family was watching TV and it kept boot cycling. Shows LG logo, goes into find which display to use, off and back on again, over and over and never stops. Never-ending boot cycle. Replaced the power cable first, no lick. Get this, if I hold down either the power button on the TV OR remote, it doesn't boot cycle! The TV will stay on and work properly with one depressed and won't do the boot cycle. I could technically tape the power button down and have no problems. I went inside the TV and disconnected the button panel, thinking it was the internals of the power button shorting out. Took batteries out of remote. Same thing. It will boot cycle with the internal power button disconnected and the batteries put of the remote. I took the power delivery board out, checked all capacitors with a multimeter (I do pc repair for a living). Couldn't find anything blown on the power board. How in the heck does a boot loop go away if I hold either power button down and then boot cycle the moment I let go of the power button? I still think it must be something with the power board.

 This may be due to power supply issue. See this video for fixing the issue if you have a technical knowledge. Without a technical knowledge you can understand issue in some level. : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB9quLQy...

 unplug the power cord from both ends ( the TV and wall outlet) wait for some time and plug it back. make sure that the power cord snugs firmly into the socket and gently tap the back of the TV ( close to the power inlet) twice. if this doesn't work, change the power supply chord.
