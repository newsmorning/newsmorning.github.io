Do you wish that there was an easier way to fix it than taking it to a repair shop? Well, you’re in luck! In this article, we’ll show you how to fix your X mount in just four easy steps. You won’t believe how simple it is!\nStep 1: Gather Your Tools\nBefore you begin, you’ll need some tools. Make sure you have a screwdriver, pliers, and some replacement parts handy. You can get these from your local hardware store or even online. You may also need a magnifying glass to see any small parts that need fixing. Once you have everything you need, you’re ready to begin.\nStep 2: Disassemble the X Mount\nCarefully disassemble the X mount using your screwdriver and pliers. Be sure to keep track of all the parts and screws so you can easily reassemble the mount. This is where your magnifying glass may come in handy for finding any damaged parts.\nStep 3: Replace the Damaged Parts\nNow that you have disassembled the X mount, it’s time to replace any damaged parts. If it’s just a matter of tightening screws or repositioning a joint, this is the time to fix it. In case there are parts that need replacement, use the ones you bought from the store or online. Ensure that you carefully insert and fix the new parts in the right position.\nStep 4: Reassemble the X Mount\nIt’s now time to put everything back together. Begin by attaching any loose screws in the correct positions. Once you have all the screws attached, systematically piece the x mount back together, keeping everything in order. Check if all the parts are well in place, then tighten up and join accordingly using the pliers and screwdriver.\nCongratulations! You have successfully repaired your X mount. You might have saved hundreds of dollars by doing it by yourself, and it didn’t take long, right? Always remember to fix your mounts with caution, and any delicate parts should be put back carefully.\nConclusion\nThere’s no need to panic when your X mount needs repairing. Sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of patience, a good set of tools, and the right replacement parts. You can easily and quickly fix it by yourself in just four straightforward steps. With Hugo Writing, you can create a remarkable article giving step-by-step insights for easy comprehension by the reader.

Do not tighten. Make sure you pay attention to the mounts. There will be a L for Left and R for right. The picture shows I used button head screws.

Once the bearings snap into the tool you can remove the M3 screw You will need 2 bearing assemblies per side so it would be wise to print 2 bearing tools.

Make sure you pay attention to the mounts. There will be a L for Left and R for right. Insert a bearing assembly onto both M3x30 screws Take the Left Top X 2020 mount+bearings and thread the M3x30 button head screws enough so the threads catch into the bottom mount Insert 2x M3x30 button head screws into the Left Top X 2020 Mount. Make sure you pay attention to the mounts. There will be a L for Left and R for right.\nInsert a bearing assembly onto both M3x30 screws\nTake the Left Top X 2020 mount+bearings and thread the M3x30 button head screws enough so the threads catch into the bottom mount\nStep 3\nRight X Mount These steps are the same as for the Left. During my last build I had issues getting the X beam to line up which is why I did it this way Mount the Right Bottom X 2020 mount to the Right Y MGN mount with 3x M3x18mm socket head screws. Do not tighten. Insert 2x M3x30 button head screws into the Right Top X 2020 mount than slide 2 bearing assemblies onto the screws Thread the 2x M3x30mm button head screws until the threads catch into the Right Bottom X 2020 mount Both Left and Right top mounts should be free to move up and down with the screws threaded into the bottom mount. Slide the Left assembly back and the Right assembly forward(See picture) Slide in the 460mm 2020 These steps are the same as for the Left. During my last build I had issues getting the X beam to line up which is why I did it this way\nMount the Right Bottom X 2020 mount to the Right Y MGN mount with 3x M3x18mm socket head screws.

Move the Left mount forward and the Right mount back at the same time and the 460mm 2020 should drop into place. Insert 2x M5x8mm button head screws + M5 T-nuts into the top and bottom of both sides but do not tighten. Slide in the 460mm 2020 into the X mounts. Move the Left mount forward and the Right mount back at the same time and the 460mm 2020 should drop into place.\nInsert 2x M5x8mm button head screws + M5 T-nuts into the top and bottom of both sides but do not tighten.\nStep 5\nX 2020 Extrusion Using 2x M5x8mm screws secure an internal corner clamp into the channel next to the Y linear rail at the front of the frame for both sides. The purpose of this is to use the corner as an alignment block. Slide the Y MGN mount and using a compression clamp clamp the front mount to the front of the printer as seen in the picture. Do this for both Left and Right sides Once both sides are clamped tighten the 6x M3x18 socket head screws, the 4x M3x30 button head screws and the 8x M5x8mm button head screws When you remove the clamps measure from the vertical 2040 to the face of 460mm 2020 and you should get the same dimension(within 1mm). If you do, remove the clamps and move on. If the dimensions are not within 1mm check the alignment of the 460mm 2020 in the X mount.

If you do, remove the clamps and move on. If the dimensions are not within 1mm check the alignment of the 460mm 2020 in the X mount.\nStep 6\nX Linear Rail Insert 9x M3x8 socket head screws and thread into 9x M3 T-Nuts. Align the T-Nuts so they drop into the 2020 channel. Using 2 2020 Linear Rail jigs start at one end of the linear rail and work your way from left to right tightening the M3x8 screws until they’re snug. Than working right to left tighten the screws another 1/4 to 1/2 turn Insert 9x M3x8 socket head screws and thread into 9x M3 T-Nuts. Align the T-Nuts so they drop into the 2020 channel.\nUsing 2 2020 Linear Rail jigs start at one end of the linear rail and work your way from left to right tightening the M3x8 screws until they’re snug.\nThan working right to left tighten the screws another 1/4 to 1/2 turn\nI wasn’t paid to write these guides. Ben asked me to do it as a favor to him. Considering all that he’s done for our community I felt it was the least I could do. To be honest even though it took about 2 months to build and document, I had a lot of fun doing it. It forced me to write guides in a manner that was easy for everyone to understand and cleanup my Github so I could share any files that were used that aren’t part of the original download. You’re not obligated but if you would like, feel free to donate.\nCancel: I did not complete this guide.\n3 other people completed this guide.

Ben asked me to do it as a favor to him. Considering all that he’s done for our community I felt it was the least I could do. To be honest even though it took about 2 months to build and document, I had a lot of fun doing it. It forced me to write guides in a manner that was easy for everyone to understand and cleanup my Github so I could share any files that were used that aren’t part of the original download.
