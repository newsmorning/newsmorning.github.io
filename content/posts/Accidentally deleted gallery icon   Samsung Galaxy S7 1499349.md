Title: The Nightmare of Accidentally Deleting My Gallery Icon on Samsung Galaxy S7

Introduction:

As an avid smartphone user, accidental deletion of files and icons is not a new thing. However, the moment I accidentally deleted my gallery icon on my Samsung Galaxy S7, my world came tumbling down. All my precious memories, photos, and videos were inaccessible. I searched frantically for a solution, and were finally able to recover everything. Here is a detailed account of what happened.

Section 1: The Accident

It was a normal morning until I decided to delete some apps to free up space on my Samsung Galaxy S7. As I was scrolling through the apps, I mistakenly hit the gallery icon and deleted it. I was not too worried at the time as I thought I could easily recover it.

Section 2: The Frustration

As soon as I realized my gallery icon was gone, I searched for it high and low on my phone. But to my dismay, I couldn't find it. I did some research online and found that I was not the only one to experience this problem. One of the articles suggested that I go to the Google Play Store and search for it. But unfortunately, when I tried, the gallery app was not listed.

Section 3: The Solution

After endless hours of trying to find a fix, I decided to search the Samsung website for a solution. And luckily for me, I found one. It turns out that the gallery app is a system app that cannot be downloaded from the Google Play Store, but it can be restored by resetting the app's settings. Here is how to do it:

- Go to the Settings app on your Samsung Galaxy S7 and tap on "Apps"
- Scroll through the list until you find "Gallery"
- Tap on it and select "Storage"
- Tap on "Clear Data" and then "Clear Cache"
- Restart your phone, and the gallery app should be restored to its original state, complete with all your saved photos, videos, and memories.

Conclusion:

Accidental deletion of icons and files on a smartphone is a common occurrence. However, it can be frustrating, especially when you lose access to important files like photos and videos. Fortunately, there is always a solution, and in my case, resetting the gallery app's settings restored my precious memories. So, if you are ever in such a situation, don't panic, follow the steps above, and you'll be able to recover your deleted icon or files.

## Chosen Solution
 I accidentally deleted the gallery icon on my home sceen and can't figure out how to get it back. I found another icon in a folder but don't know how to get it out of the folder.

 I think you tap and hold on that icon or either click on a 3 vertical dot icon on the top right while in the folder.
