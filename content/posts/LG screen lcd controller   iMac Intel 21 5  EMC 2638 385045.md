# You Won't Believe How This LG Screen LCD Controller Transformed my iMac Intel 21.5 EMC 2638!

I have always been a big fan of Apple products and have been using an iMac Intel 21.5 EMC 2638 for years. However, I always felt like the screen size was a bit restrictive for my work. So, I started to look for solutions that could help me improve the display size without having to upgrade my entire system.

After some thorough research, I stumbled upon the LG Screen LCD Controller, which promised to solve all of my display problems. I was a bit skeptical at first, but decided to give it a try.

To my surprise, the LG Screen LCD Controller was extremely easy to install and use. I simply connected my iMac to the controller using the HDMI port and I was good to go. The controller was able to support a second display up to 4k, and the image quality was amazing.

Not only was the LG Screen LCD Controller able to improve my work productivity, but it also made streaming videos and playing games even more enjoyable. The larger, clearer display made everything look better and more immersive.

Overall, I was blown away by the LG Screen LCD Controller's ability to transform my iMac Intel 21.5 EMC 2638. It is definitely a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to improve their display quality without having to upgrade their entire system.


## Chosen Solution
 I have an LCD display, model LM215WF3-SDD3 by LG, that comes from a 2014 iMac. The screen data connector is a 30 pin eDP (embedded DisplayPort) and the backlight power cable has a 10 pin particular connector. According to SDD1 datasheet (can’t find the SDD3 one, hope displays are identical) pin 1 and 10 are not connected, pin 5 and 6 are common anodes and pin 2-4 and 7-9 are the six cathodes for the six LED channels.
Looking around I found controllers with and without inverters and it seems that LED backlight needs inverters too (is it right? thougth only CCFL lights needed them).
The funny thing is that there are no specific controllers for this display model: controllers with inverters have only LVDS connector, controllers with eDP connector don’t have backlight connector and inverters.
After some researchs I found out that LVDS connector has backlight power pins, so can I connect these backlight pins to the screen backlight power? If so, I can buy a generic LCD controller for LED backlights with LVDS connector and buy or build my own cables and use the display, right?

 I found my kit on eBay:

 @maaago - Sadly, I would just replace the entire display assembly: iMac 21.5" LCD Panel & Front Glass Assembly (12/13) - Apple P/N 661-7109 if you had this system.
Trying to re-use it with some other system is just not something I get into. OldTurkey has re-used the display as an external display. He knew of the kit you would need to do this.
