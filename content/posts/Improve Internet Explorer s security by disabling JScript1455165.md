You Won't Believe How Easy It is to Protect Your PC! Disable This One Script and Wave Goodbye to Internet Explorer's Security Flaws Forever!

Internet Explorer, despite being launched over 25 years ago, is still one of the most widely used web browsers in the world today. However, its security flaws are becoming increasingly well-known. Fortunately, there's a simple solution that can significantly reduce the risks of using the browser. With a few clicks, you can disable a particular script and keep your PC safe.

The script in question is called "Active Scripting," which is an old feature that was used to enhance the functionality of websites. However, it has since become a serious security risk. Active Scripting is essentially a programming language that is embedded in web pages, allowing them to perform complex tasks. Unfortunately, it's also been used as a tool for hackers to spread malware and other malicious software.

Disabling Active Scripting is a straightforward process, and it can be done in a few simple steps. Here's how:

Step 1: Launch Internet Explorer

Step 2: Click on the "Tools" button (the icon is a cogwheel) in the top right corner of the screen

Step 3: Select "Internet Options" from the dropdown menu

Step 4: Click on the "Security" tab at the top of the window

Step 5: Click on the "Custom Level" button

Step 6: Scroll down to the "Scripting" section

Step 7: Click on the "Disable" radio button under "Active Scripting"

Step 8: Click "OK" to save the changes

That's it! By disabling Active Scripting, you've removed one of the most significant security threats to your PC when using Internet Explorer.

You might be wondering, what about the websites that require Active Scripting to run correctly? Unfortunately, some websites might not work correctly after disabling the script. However, it's best to be safe than sorry. You can always enable Active Scripting again if you encounter a website that requires it. Follow the same steps as above, but select "Enable" under "Active Scripting" to turn it back on.

It's worth noting that Active Scripting is not the only security flaw with Internet Explorer. It's important to keep your browser up to date with the latest security patches and to exercise caution when browsing online. However, disabling Active Scripting is an excellent step towards keeping your PC secure.

In conclusion, keeping your PC secure doesn't have to be a complicated task. By disabling Active Scripting in Internet Explorer, you can reduce the risks of using the browser significantly. It only takes a few clicks to make your browsing experience safer, so why not do it today? You won't believe how easy it is to protect your PC!

For those who don’t know, JScript is Microsoft’s dialect of the ECMAScript language specification in the form of an Active Scripting engine.
 
The newly introduced option to block Jscript (Jscript.dll) execution is essential when it comes to offering an improved browsing experience in terms of security.
 
Microsoft recommends that users disable the legacy JScript execution for websites in the Internet and Restricted Sites zones. The reasons behind this decision are revealed by Microsoft:
 
## How to disable JScript in Internet Explorer?
 
- Click Start > Run.
 - Up next, type regedt32 or simply regedit and click OK.
 - Locate this registry subkey in Registry Editor in order to disable JScript execution in Internet Zone: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3\140D
 - You need to locate the following registry subkey in Registry Editor if you want to disable JScript execution in Restricted Sites Zone: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\4\140D
 - Right-click the appropriate registry subkey, then click Modify.
 - Type 3 in the Edit DWORD (32-bit) Value dialog box.
 - Click OK to confirm your action.
 - Finally, restart Internet Explorer for the changes to take place.

 
In order to toggle off the JScript execution in Internet Explorer for Internet Zone and Restricted Sites Zone, you need to go through the procedures described above.
 
Blocking Jscript helps protect against malicious actors targeting the JScript scripting engine while maintaining user productivity as core services continue to function as usual.
 
After you make the changes, the browser will not run JScript from websites that are in the Internet Zone or Restricted Sites Zone and that use Internet Explorer’s legacy document modes (Internet Explorer 9 and prior versions).
 
Adding this option is a chance for IT admins and not only to assure a secure browsing experience across enterprise environments.
 
Moreover, Microsoft will continue to provide security updates for JScript via the latest cumulative updates for Windows 10, and Cumulative Updates for Internet Explorer 11, so it’s a matter of waiting.
 
Let us know in the comments area below if you’ve also managed to disable JScript in Internet Explorer.
