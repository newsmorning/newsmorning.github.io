Warning: Pulled Pads Galore When Replacing Charger Port on iPad Air LTE

At some point, we've all experienced that moment of panic when our phone or tablet's charger port stops working. Thankfully, for most of us, the problem can be easily fixed by replacing the charger port. However, for those who decide to take on the repair themselves, they may encounter some unexpected obstacles.

Recently, we decided to attempt the repair ourselves on an iPad Air LTE, believing it to be a straightforward fix. We purchased a brand new charger port and set to work, armed with a YouTube tutorial and a steady hand.

As we began to carefully pry open the iPad, we quickly realized the task was not as simple as we thought. The adhesive that secured the screen to the frame was impossibly strong, and after a considerable amount of force, we were finally able to lift the screen up.

Once we reached the internal components of the iPad, we located the charger port and carefully removed it from the device. However, as we tried to install the new port, we noticed that several of the tiny pads which connect the charger port to the logic board were missing.

In a panic, we searched online for a solution but found limited information on how to repair pulled pads on iPad logic boards. We were left with no choice but to purchase a new logic board entirely, adding an unexpected expense to our initial charger port replacement.

Perhaps we underestimated the complexity of repairing a device as advanced as an iPad Air LTE. While we were initially confident in our ability to fix the problem, we quickly learned that even the smallest mistake could lead to costly consequences.

In conclusion, we caution anyone considering taking on a DIY repair of a charger port on an advanced device such as an iPad Air LTE. While it may be tempting to save money by doing it yourself, the risk of damage to the device's internal components is high, which can lead to costly repairs. We recommend seeking professional support to fix more complex issues in electronic devices.

## Chosen Solution
 Tried to replace a iPad air charger port, Pulled 3 pads however, Pads 3,9 and 27
soldered new port in iPad still charges, pads 3,9 & 27 are ground pads 

1.) should these  ground pads be connected using jumper wires? im at a loss to where to connect them

if No

does this not make the circuit open, and is it safe?
