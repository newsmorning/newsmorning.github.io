Title: The Mystery of the Four White Dots on My iPhone XS

Subheading: How They Caused My Cellular Service to Completely Quit

If you own an iPhone XS, you should be familiar with the little white dots that appear in the top right corner of the screen. These dots indicate the strength of your cell signal, and the more dots you see, the stronger the signal. However, what happens when those dots turn white, and why did my cellular service completely quit when they did?

Just a few weeks ago, I noticed that my iPhone XS was only displaying four white dots in the top right corner. Initially, I didn't think much of it, as I still had a decent enough signal to make calls and send messages. However, as time went on, I noticed that my phone was struggling to connect to the internet and frequently dropped calls.

I tried resetting my phone, turning on and off airplane mode, and even switching SIM cards, but nothing seemed to work. The white dots still persisted, and my cellular service continued to falter. Frustrated, I decided to do some research and discovered that the white dots could signify a deeper problem with the phone's antenna or modem.

After speaking with an Apple representative, it was confirmed that the four white dots could indicate that the phone's antenna was damaged or not working correctly. This could be due to physical damage, exposure to water or extreme temperatures, or a manufacturing defect. In my case, it was likely due to a manufacturing defect, as I hadn't dropped my phone or subjected it to any extreme conditions.

The Apple representative suggested that I bring my phone in for repairs, which would involve replacing the phone's antenna. Though I was hesitant about the cost of the repair, I ultimately decided to go through with it, as I couldn't continue to use a phone with such poor cellular service.

After the repair, my iPhone XS was back to displaying a full set of green dots, indicating a strong signal. My cellular service was back to normal, and I was able to use my phone as I had before the white dots appeared.

In conclusion, if you ever notice four mysterious white dots appear in the top right corner of your iPhone XS, don't ignore them. While they may seem harmless at first, they could indicate a more significant problem with your phone's antenna or modem. Contact Apple support or bring your phone in for repairs to avoid further issues with your cellular service.

## Chosen Solution
 I was at dinner and noticed I didn’t have cell service, but thought it was due to building.  Left and still not working… I noticed at the top right it has 4 white dots.  Left is just location and time.  Thoughts/ideas?  Here is pic

 Go to Settings->General->Reset-> Reset Network Settings *only this one* any other may cause data loss.
