# Is Your JBL Speaker Acting Up? Discover the Surprising Reason Why Link 20 Won't Pair or Power Up!

If you have ever tried to use your JBL Link 20 portable speaker and experienced difficulties in getting it to pair or power up, you are not alone. Many users have reported similar problems, and it can be frustrating not knowing the root cause of the issue.

After extensive research, we have discovered a surprising reason why your JBL Link 20 may not be pairing or powering up.

The culprit? Your speaker's firmware.

What is firmware? It is the software that is embedded in your speaker's hardware that allows it to operate properly. Improper or outdated firmware can lead to performance issues, including trouble pairing or powering up.

So, how can you fix this? Here are some steps to follow:

1. Check if the firmware is up-to-date: Go to the JBL website and check if there are any firmware updates available for your JBL Link 20. If there is an update, download it and install it on your speaker. This can help solve most pairing or powering up issues.

2. Reset your speaker: If updating the firmware did not work, try resetting your speaker. To do this, press and hold the power button for at least 10 seconds until the speaker goes off. Once it is off, turn it back on and try to pair it with your device again.

3. Reboot your device: If the above steps did not work, try rebooting the device you are trying to pair with the JBL Link 20. This can help clear any software glitches that may have occurred during the pairing process.

4. Contact JBL customer support: If none of the above steps work, contact JBL customer support. They may be able to provide additional troubleshooting steps or send a replacement if your speaker is still under warranty.

In conclusion, firmware issues are a common reason for JBL Link 20 speakers not pairing or powering up. By following the steps above, you can troubleshoot and resolve most issues. If the problem persists, contact JBL customer support for further assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a link 20 that will not pair to my android phone

 Hi @jsbtvb ,
Bit confused when you say "Link 20 won't pair or power up" and then say "I have a link 20 that will not pair to my android phone". Which is it?  If it doesn't power up it won't pair.
Does it turn on when the charger is connected?
If it does and then it won't pair, try to reset the device by holding down the mute button for 15 seconds. The device will then power off. When you power it back on, it will be factory restored. Then try pairing it with your phone.
If it doesn't turn on or indicate that it is charging when the power is connected have you tried a different known working charger cable or charger?
