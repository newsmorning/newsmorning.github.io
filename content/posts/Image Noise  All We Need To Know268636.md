title: WARNING: You May be Destroying Your Images with Image Noise! Learn How to Save Them Now!

As a digital photographer, you always strive for the clearest and sharpest images. However, one of the biggest threats to the quality of your images is image noise. This occurrence can make your images appear grainy, blurry and less than professional. In this article, we’ll discuss what image noise is, how to identify it, and practical ways to reduce or eliminate it.

What is Image Noise?

In simple terms, image noise is the grainy pixilation that you might see in your photos. The occurrence of image noise is influenced by many factors like camera type, lighting, and ISO settings. Image noise occurs when there is too little light on the sensor of the camera, which means that the camera boosts the signal and introduces a digital noise graph into the photo. While small amounts of noise are difficult to spot, severe noise can make your image unusable by causing it to appear blurry and lacking detail.

Identifying Image Noise

To identify image noise, look closely at your images after taking them. Noise is easiest to spot in the areas that lack detail, like the sky or large percentages of color. Also, image noise worsens at high ISO settings, which sometimes makes it difficult to get the photo sharp in lower light settings. 

How to Save Your Image from Noise

Here are several ways to reduce or remove image noise from your photos:

1. Use the Correct Camera Settings

Before taking the photo, always check your camera settings. To minimize noise, choose the lowest possible ISO and exposure time necessary for your subject. However, it’s important to note that with low light situations, you will have to compensate that by the increased ISO you’re using.

2. Edit Post-Shooting

Image editing software can help you reduce or remove image noise altogether. There are several noise reduction tools available in photo editing software, including the Noise Reduction Filter in Photoshop, which works excellently in removing noise from the image while maintaining its sharpness. 

3. Use Better Equipment

Consider upgrading your camera to one with better low-light performance. Newer camera models have a better signal to noise ratio that helps reduce noise.

4. Sharpen in Moderation

Sharpening tools in photo editing software tend to exacerbate noise in images. Therefore, it’s important to sharpen in moderation.

5. Be Mindful of Other Elements

Besides camera settings and editing, there are ways to reduce noise from your composition. For instance, avoid using slow lenses in low light conditions, which reduces the amount of light that enters the camera. Also, make sure to avoid overexposing the photo, which over-emphasizes the digital noise.

In conclusion, image noise is a common occurrence in photography that can ruin even the most beautiful photos. Understanding the cause and identification of noise in photos is essential in minimizing its appearance. Adopting proper photography and editing techniques and choosing the right equipment can help you achieve clean, sharp images that you’ll be proud of.

You have probably already seen digital noise as the colored speckles or grains over images particularly those taken at night.
 
Noise is any kind of deviation from what’s expected at the pixel level. For example, your camera may record something slightly darker or lighter. When this happens on a significant enough scale to end up with a visible texture, which refers to noise.
 
It’s usually easier to see noise in flat featureless areas of an image such as in a sky rather than in scenes of more intricate details. The reason for this is the busier scenes effectively hide some of the noise whereas areas of little detail could be seen with some noise if you look closely.
 
### Causes of noise in an image
 
There are number of reasons why images look distorted and grainy. Some of which you can’t do anything about. Some noise for example happens because of how light arrives at the sensor and some is generated simply from converting each pixel into digital information. Let’s see more about what causes digital noise in images.
 
- ISO

 
ISO is the main cause of noise. Higher ISO that should be used in low light or at night distorts the image when clicked in daylight. So, higher the ISO, more noise will exist in the image.
 
- Sensor Size

 
For noise, the size of the sensor counts. Mobile phone cameras and compact cameras have a small sensor to their camera. So, when we click on these devices it can’t even reach the level of 400 ISO that makes the image more distorted and color fidelity can be noticed easily. Whereas when taken on larger cameras like DSLRs, the produced image is much clearer and detailed, as the lower grain image is produced by them.
 
- Pixel Density

 
This can be explained by taking an example. Suppose a camera with sensor of 14 MP clicks an image. Now as we know, that it will generate more noise than a lower megapixel camera. Why?
 
Because when we click a picture from a 14 MP camera, it will squeeze the actual pixels as compared to low-MP camera. This will automatically distort the image.
 
- Exposure Time

 
Longer exposure time can also create the noise.
 
Now, let’s see what types of noise could be caused.
 
### Types of noise in image processing
 
- Gaussian Noise Model or Amplifier Noise

 
Gaussian Noise refers to the statistical noise with PDF (probability distribution function) equal to normal distribution. It is also known as Gaussian Distribution.
 
In terms of image processing, gaussian noise is additive in nature and has zero mean value.
 
This type of noise can be filtered using spatial filter that smoothens the image. Gaussian smoothing, also known as gaussian blur is produced by the Gaussian function in an image. This smoothing is used in graphics and designing software to reduce image noise and details.
 
- Salt and Pepper Noise

 
Salt and pepper noise is also known as shot noise or Impulse noise. This noise is caused by disturbance during the image taken. Malfunctioning of camera sensors or timing error can cause this type of noise in an image.
 
Basically, when we take a look at an image, it shows up as black and white pixels on an image, that is why it is called salt and pepper noise.
 
This type of noise can be filtered by using mean and median filter technique or by gaussian filter also.
 
- Quantization Noise

 
Quantization noise is also known as uniform noise. This noise is caused by quantization of pixels of an image up to number of levels. It is called uniform noise because its distribution is approximately uniform throughout the process.
 
It can be used to produce various types of noise distribution as it has uniform distribution as well as for degrading the images so that it can be used in image restoration algorithms.
 
How can noise be avoided in images?
 
Sensors also produce more noise in warmer conditions and as they heat up through use. So, you should bear this in mind when shooting in particularly hot conditions.
 
There are number of things to minimize noise appearing in your images. The general rule is using the lower ISO settings available will lead to less noise forming. So only use the high one when you must.
 
If your camera has an ISO setting it may allow you to set maximum sensitivity so that you can avoid using sensitivities past a certain point.
 
Instead of using the high sensitivity, you could try to use a wide aperture this will let lighter pass through the sensor and will stand to create a cleaner image than the high ISO setting. Although you should make sure that the wide aperture maintains the depth of field that you want in your image. You could also try a long exposure instead of high ISO settings.
