Transform Your Asus Transformer Book T100Ta Into a Powerhouse with this Quick and Easy Internal Hard Drive Upgrade!

If you're an Asus Transformer Book T100Ta user, you might have noticed that the device's internal hard drive is not sufficient to store your important files, games, and applications. Running out of storage can be frustrating, but you can easily solve this problem by upgrading your device's hard drive.

Upgrading the hard drive of your Asus Transformer Book T100Ta can provide you with more storage space, faster read and write speeds, and overall better performance. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps on how to upgrade your internal hard drive quickly and easily.

What You'll Need

- A new internal hard drive
- A small Phillips screwdriver
- An external USB drive or SD card for backing up your data
- A cloning software (we recommend Macrium Reflect)

Step 1: Prepare Your Device

Before you start the upgrade process, back up your data to an external USB drive or SD card to prevent data loss. Also, make sure to shut down your device and unplug any cables, including the power adapter.

Step 2: Open Your Device

Flip your Asus Transformer Book T100Ta on its face and remove the small rubber feet near the bottom of the device. Use a small Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws underneath the rubber feet. Once you've removed the screws, use a plastic tool, such as a guitar pick, to separate the back cover from the device.

Step 3: Remove the Old Hard Drive

Locate the hard drive inside your device. Use a small Phillips screwdriver to remove the screw on the hard drive bracket and gently remove the bracket from the hard drive. Then, remove the cable connector from the hard drive carefully.

Step 4: Install the New Hard Drive

Now that you've successfully removed the old hard drive, it's time to install the new one. Connect the cable connector to the new hard drive and secure it with the bracket by screwing it down.

Step 5: Clone Your Data

In order to have all your data and operating system on the new hard drive, you'll need to clone it from the old one. You can use Macrium Reflect, which is free software for cloning hard drives. Install the software on your device and follow the instructions on how to clone your old hard drive to your new one.

Step 6: Test Your Device

Once you've cloned your data, it's time to check if everything works correctly. Reconnect your Asus Transformer Book T100Ta to the power supply and turn it on. If everything works well, you'll see your new hard drive and all your files and software will be available.

Conclusion

Upgrading the internal hard drive of your Asus Transformer Book T100Ta is a simple and easy process that can be done in only a few steps. In this article, we've guided you through the process of upgrading your device's hard drive quickly and easily. By following these simple steps, you can have a more powerful and efficient device that can store all your important data and applications.

## Chosen Solution
 The biggest limit to the Asus t100 is its internal hard drive, which in my case is only 32 GB and this means I am limited from day one. So I was thinking, can I open the tablet, remove its internal hard drive, and replace it with a fast 128 GB MicroSD instead? I'm no technician but I don't see why that's not a great idea ;)!
P.S. Why not multiple MicroSDs?? ;D

 Yes, its fully possible to open up your T100 and replace the ssd/hdd with a bigger capacity one.  Alternativly, if you do not wish to open it up, you could simply buy a microSD card and put it in for extra space. This method would be risk-free and could add up to 128gb of flash storage.
