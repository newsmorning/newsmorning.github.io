# Is Your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 Dead? Find Out Why it Won't Charge or Turn On! Only a Green LED. Possible Solution Inside!

If you own a MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 and it won't charge or turn on, you're not alone. Many MacBook Pro users have experienced this issue, and it can be frustrating. The only sign of life you may see is a green LED light on the MagSafe charger. But what does this mean, and what can you do to fix the problem? In this article, we'll outline some common causes of the issue and potential solutions.

## Common Causes

The MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 has been known to experience two common issues that can result in it not charging or turning on. These are:

### 1. Dead Battery

If the battery in your MacBook Pro is dead, it won't be able to charge or turn on. This can be caused by the age of the battery (batteries typically last 3-5 years) or by overuse.

### 2. Failed Logic Board

The logic board is the main circuit board in your MacBook Pro, and it controls the power and function of the device. If the logic board fails, your MacBook Pro won't be able to charge or turn on.

## Possible Solutions

If your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 won't charge or turn on, there are a few potential solutions you can try:

### 1. Reset the SMC

The System Management Controller (SMC) is responsible for controlling the power and other important functions on your MacBook Pro. If the SMC isn't working properly, your MacBook may not be able to charge or turn on. To reset the SMC:

1. Shut down your MacBook Pro.
2. Hold down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the left side of the keyboard, and then press the power button at the same time.
3. Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.
4. Press the power button to turn on your MacBook Pro.

### 2. Replace the Battery

If the battery in your MacBook Pro is dead, you'll need to replace it. You can do this yourself if you have some technical skills and the right tools. There are many online tutorials and videos that can guide you through the process. Alternatively, you can take your MacBook Pro to an Apple Store or authorized repair center to have the battery replaced.

### 3. Repair the Logic Board

If the logic board in your MacBook Pro has failed, you'll need to have it repaired or replaced. This is a more complicated and expensive solution, and it's best to have it done by a certified technician.

## Conclusion

If your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 won't charge or turn on, it can be a frustrating experience. But don't panic - there are several potential solutions you can try. Whether it's resetting the SMC, replacing the battery, or repairing the logic board, there's a good chance you can get your MacBook Pro back up and running. If none of these solutions work, it may be time to consider upgrading to a newer model. But before you do that, be sure to exhaust all the possible solutions first. Good luck!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi all,
i’ve bought a MacBook Pro Early 2011 A1278 model 2nd hand.
Changed some faulty plastic keys, Changed in SSD Kingston, Put 2x4gb Crucial 1333mhz. All was good and perfect. Only the battery has got more 1300 cycles, so I decided to buy a new one.
After replacing the battery it started to give me some problems…
It descharged and never restarted working correctly. I have tried also to put back original battery without any chanche.
Now it give me a green led on the power charger, but no switching on.
Actually I can switch only with this:
1) remove the power charger
2) press power button for 2-3seconds
3) connect the power charger
4) leave power button
5) it starts with full fans load, not sowing battery status, no led on power charger, and if I disconnect the power it shuts down.
I have tried to put back original HDD, original RAM, original battery… no changes.
I have last SMC version: 1.68f99
It’s a MacBook Pro early 2011 with i5 2.3GHz.
I Appreciate your help.
