Discover the Fix You Didn’t Know You Needed!\nSubheading: A Comprehensive Guide on How to Fix the Sunken and Sticking Home Button on Your iPad Air Wi-Fi\nAre you experiencing problems with your iPad Air Wi-Fi’s home button? Specifically, is it sunken and sticking? This issue can be quite frustrating, especially when you need to access your home screen quickly. But worry not, as there’s a fix for it that you probably didn’t know you needed.\nIn this article, we’ll walk you through the different steps you can take to fix the sunken and sticking home button on your iPad Air Wi-Fi. So, let’s get started!\nStep 1: Restart Your iPad\nBefore attempting any physical fix, the first thing you should try is restarting your iPad. This can sometimes help resolve software issues that are causing the sunken and sticking home button.\nTo restart your iPad, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Red Slider appears. Slide it to power off your iPad. Wait for a few seconds, then turn it back on by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button again.\nStep 2: Clean Your Home Button\nIf restarting your iPad doesn’t help, the next step is to clean your home button. Over time, dirt and debris can accumulate around the button, causing it to stick and become sunken. To clean it, follow the steps below:\nTurn off your iPad by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button until the Red Slider appears.\nUse a soft-bristled brush to gently scrub around the home button. Be careful not to press too hard, as this may damage your iPad.\nUse a clean, dry cloth to wipe away any dirt and debris that you dislodged with the brush.\nTurn your iPad back on by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button.\nStep 3: Use a Third-Party App\nIf cleaning your home button doesn’t help, you can try using a third-party app. There are several apps available that allow you to create a virtual home button on your iPad’s screen. These apps can be quite helpful if your home button is completely unresponsive.\nTo use a virtual home button app, follow the steps below:\nGo to the App Store and search for “virtual home button.”\nChoose an app that has good reviews and download it.\nFollow the app’s instructions to set up a virtual home button on your iPad’s screen.\nStep 4: Repair Your Home Button\nIf none of the above steps work, it may be time to consider repairing your home button. This can be quite expensive if you go through Apple, but there are several third-party repair services that can fix your home button for a fraction of the cost.\nTo find a reputable third-party repair service, do your research and read online reviews. Make sure to choose a service that has experience working with iPad Air Wi-Fi models.\nIn conclusion, a sunken and sticking home button on your iPad Air Wi-Fi can be quite frustrating. However, there are several steps you can take to fix it, including restarting your iPad, cleaning your home button, using a third-party app, or repairing your home button. With a bit of patience and persistence, you can get your home button back to working order in no time!\nChosen Solution I replaced the screen on my first iPad Air ever. Before closing it up I did the usual QA check. And after closing it up I did it again. All was well on my bench. Two days later the customer contacts me to tell me that the home button was sunkin and sticking. Sure enough when he brings it back to me, it’s sunk. I removed the screen and compared it to the old one (which thankfully I had not tossed yet) and there was a missing cushion. I replaced the cushion and sealed it again. I test it and it works fine. Call the guy to come get it and show it to him while he is there. He calls me an hour or so later and says it still has the same problem. So I offer to replace the screen at no cost to hime. I order from a different company and make sure that I odrdered the screen with home button installed!!!! I put the new screen in and transfer the cushion. Sure enough after a day of usage, the fellow calls me AGAIN and says the same thing is happening. I know this person, not that well, but we travel in the same circles so I know he’s not putting one over on me or anything like that. The problem is legit. Anyone else have such a problem with an iPad Air? What did you do to resolve it? Thanks, Norm\nThere are few things that could have gone wrong. Check out this post, it’s quite similar to your problem and has some very good solutions. replaced glass, home button sunkin in?\nPut your lips on the button and suck really really hard. It’ll pop right out. Worked for me.\nHold the power button until “slide to power off” shows up. After that release the power button and old until it turns back into the home screen. If it turns on Siri, it’s ok. This just helps to clean the ram :)\n","wordCount":"890","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Ganley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-feels-sunk-in-and-sticks-ipad-air-wi-fi-1189229/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your iPad Air Wi-Fi's Home Button Sunken and Sticking?
