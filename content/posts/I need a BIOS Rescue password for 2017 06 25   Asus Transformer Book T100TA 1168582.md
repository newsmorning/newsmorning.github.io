## Chosen Solution
 There is a box at start up asking for a password and I didn't set it up. It is my tablet but a "friend" thought it would be nice to have it password protected. Now, they cant remember what they entered. I was able to press ALT + R to get to Enter Rescue Password for 2017/06/25. I found this site http://pastebin.com/L3c3rySj# for reset codes but they don't go as high as today's date.. UGH! I tried and tried to enter a correct password, no go.
Does ANYONE have any ideas? Please? I appreciate any input.

 Prueba esta, al parecer se repite cada 10 a√±os ABBL9ABB

 Alt+R= 2012/01/06  need your help please. ...Asus pc notebook model T100T....

 I have the same exact problem but my rescue passwords dated to current so I don't know if this would work but it's worth a try.
Remove CMOS battery and drain all residue power from from the board, hoping that would reset the date settings back.

 I need a rescue password for my Asus T100T 2012/01/02 Help please

 Use the year 2007.. same day and month

 just in case it serves others :
get your Bios date from the POST screen or use  free tools like speccy to get it, or type "systeminfo" at the command line prompt and check the results for the BIOS part (bios vendor and bios date).
If you can use windows, set the system date to your bios date, at a time inside the day (say 00:00:00 or 12:00 AM for example).  Now reboot and press F2 to access BIOS.
Enter directly  your password derived  from your Bios date as stated here :    https://pastebin.com/L3c3rySj
Note some PCs require to enter a wrong password first then the display changes from "password"  to "rescue password".
Enter your password as you would on a QWERTY keyboard : it means for example that
1-9 &0  are on the 2nd row under F1-F11 without pressing shift,
3rd row begins with Tab,QWERTY
4th row letters begin with ASDFGHJKL
5th row letters begin  ZXCVBNM
When password is OK, the current date being the BIOS date, BIOS panel opens.
Then go to "security" menu and set an empty password for Administrator an user.
Returned message should read "password uninstalled" or something similar.
Next time  , F2 will not ask for anything if Admin password was correctly blanked out.
This worked for me for an ASUS X73S  having a BIOS date somewhere in january 2009.
Hope it helps any further reader to get some old ASUS back to use.

 sadly, none of the methods have worked, and i've been very thorough...only way now is David Zou's method or manage to flash them with..maybe Kiosk?  whatever method works will require obliterating the password lock...
