If you're an outdoor enthusiast, you likely know the benefits of owning a Patagonia Nano Puff jacket. The lightweight yet warm jacket is perfect for hiking, climbing, and other outdoor activities. However, something that I've always found lacking in the jacket was a hood. Sure, the Nano Puff comes with a high collar that keeps your neck warm, but it's not enough to protect your head from the elements. 

That's why I decided to take matters into my own hands and add a hood to my trusty Patagonia Nano Puff jacket. And let me tell you, it transformed the jacket into a whole new piece of gear! 

Firstly, adding a hood made the jacket much more versatile. No longer do I need to pack a separate hat or worry about my ears freezing on a windy day. Having a hood integrated into the jacket makes it so much easier to protect my head and stay warm in various weather conditions. 

But that's not all. The hood also added an extra layer of warmth and comfort to the existing jacket. Since the hood is made of the same material as the Nano Puff, it seamlessly blends in and provides extra insulation for your head. The result? A jacket that is now even warmer and more comfortable to wear. 

Now, you may be wondering how exactly I added the hood to my Patagonia Nano Puff jacket. It was actually quite simple! I purchased a hooded jacket from the same material and color as my Nano Puff and had it attached to the collar of my jacket by a tailor. It's important to note that this process may not work for every jacket, so it's always best to consult with a professional. 

In conclusion, adding a hood to my Patagonia Nano Puff jacket was a game-changer. Not only did it make the jacket more versatile, but it also added an extra layer of warmth and comfort. If you're considering adding a hood to your outdoor gear, I highly recommend it. It's a small modification that can make a huge difference in your overall comfort and enjoyment of the outdoors.

## Chosen Solution
 So I have had my current Nano Puff jacket for a little over a year and I absolutely love it. The one thing I wish I would have considered when purchasing a Nano Puff jacket would be to buy one with a hood. Is there anyway I can send my jacket in to get a Nano Puff hood added to it? I understand that most people would just buy another Nano Puff jacket with a hood but I find that to be a complete waste as my current jacket is in great shape and functions fine! Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!

 There are local shops you can find that will do modifications to gear. Theyâ€™d need to look at your specific hood. There is a local shop here in Seattle that will take mail in order repairs: http://rainypass.com/modifications/
Although the reason most folks will just buy a new one, is that the cost of that alternation will likely be more than buying a new jacket. That is unfortunately the nature of a mass production society. But I agree with your sentiment about not wanting to get rid of something that works fine. Though you likely could find a new owner for it.
