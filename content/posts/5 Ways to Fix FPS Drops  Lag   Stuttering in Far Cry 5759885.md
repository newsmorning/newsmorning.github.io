# Say Goodbye to Frustrating Gaming: Learn 5 Proven Tips to Fix FPS Drops, Lag, and Stuttering in Far Cry 5!

Far Cry 5 is a popular first-person shooter game that has been gaining attention from gamers worldwide. However, you cannot deny the fact that FPS drops, lag, and stuttering can make it unbearable to play sometimes. If you're looking for solutions to fix them, then you're in the right place! In this article, we'll explore five proven tips to help you say goodbye to frustrating gaming in Far Cry 5.

## Upgrade Your PC's Hardware

One of the main reasons for FPS drops, lag, and stuttering in Far Cry 5 is outdated hardware. If your PC is not powerful enough to run the game, it's going to struggle, leading to these annoying issues. The solution is simple: upgrade your hardware! Invest in a better graphics card, a faster processor, and more RAM. These upgrades will help your PC run Far Cry 5 smoothly without experiencing these problems.

## Optimize Far Cry 5's Settings

If your hardware is up-to-date, but you're still experiencing lag or FPS drops, it might be time to optimize Far Cry 5's settings. You can try lowering the game's settings to decrease the load on the system. Turn off certain graphics features, such as shadows or reflections, to see if it improves your gameplay experience. Lowering the resolution is also a viable solution to reduce the strain on the system.

## Update Your Graphics Card Drivers

Outdated graphics card drivers can cause severe performance issues in Far Cry 5. Drivers are the software that runs your graphics card, and their primary purpose is to communicate with the operating system, instructing it on how to use the graphics card. To avoid this problem, make sure to update your graphics card drivers regularly. Visit the manufacturer's website and download the latest driver to install on your PC.

## Avoid Running Other Programs in the Background

Running other programs, such as a web browser, video editor, or streaming software, can affect Far Cry 5's performance. This can lead to FPS drops, lag, and stuttering issues. To avoid these problems, make sure to close any applications running in the background before launching the game. This will free up resources that your PC can use to run the game.

## Defragment Your Hard Drive

As you use your PC, data gets fragmented on the hard drive. This can cause slow load times and low frame-rates in games. Defragmenting your hard drive will help organize the data and make it easier for your system to access it. In turn, you'll experience faster load times, smoother gameplay, and reduced lag.

In conclusion, Far Cry 5 is an exceptional game, but it can be a real pain when you constantly experience lag, stuttering, and FPS drops. The tips discussed in this article will help you improve your gaming experience by eliminating these issues. Invest in a better hardware, optimize your settings, update your graphics card driver, avoid running many programs in the background, and defragment your hard drive. By following these tips, you will enjoy a better gaming experience, and all these issues will be a thing of the past.

## Why is my Far Cry 5 running on low FPS and lagging?
 
This behavior can be the result of multiple causes, ranging from your device being incompatible with the game, to your graphics card’s drivers being outdated.
 
Other processes running in the background and in-game overlays can also contribute to noticeable frame drops and stuttering.
 
When playing a graphics or CPU-demanding game, we recommend closing other processes such as browsers, VPNs, or other programs.

If you have the rig for it, of course. Microsoft actually emphasized that Windows 11 will be their best operating system for gaming so far.
 
The company recently reminds users about the constant work that goes into improving the gaming experience on the latest OS.
 
## How can I fix stuttering, lagging, and low FPS for Far Cry 5?
 
### 1. Check system requirements
 
There is absolutely no point in going further into this troubleshooting process if the PC you are trying to play Far Cry 5 on doesn’t have the required specs to run it.
 
In fact, before even buying and installing the game, we recommend you check the list of system requirements associated with the title.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.

In fact, we are going to provide it for you, so you know exactly what to expect when installing this highly-popular Ubisoft game.
 
This should be the number one step you take when deciding to pick up Far Cry 5 if you want to avoid unpleasant surprises and disappointment. 
 
### 2. Adjust in-game Graphics Settings
 
In-game graphic/visual settings will make the difference between a good or bad experience, depending on your PC specs as well.
 
Make sure you press Esc while in-game and access the Graphics Settings to perform the required tweaks for excellent compatibility.
 
Not going for options such as motion blur, and turning down the quality for shadows or volumetric fog will result in more FPS.
 
### 3. Update GPU driver
 
- Search for Device Manager and open the app.
 - Expand Display adapters, then right-click on our GPU and select Update driver.
 - Select Search automatically for drivers.

 
### 4. Disable in-game Framerate Lock
 
You might now know this, but Far Cry 5 comes with a built-in Framerate lock that is set to 30 or 60 FPS by default, depending on your PC specs.
 
To make sure that everything goes smoothly and avoid any kind of GPU driver errors, be sure to use a complete driver update assistant that will solve your problems with just a couple of clicks, and we strongly recommend DriverFix. Follow these easy steps to safely update your drivers:
 
- Download and install DriverFix.
 - Launch the software.

 - The application will now show you all the drivers that have issues, and you just need to select the ones you’d liked fixed.
 - Wait for the app to download and install the newest drivers.
 - Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

 
 Disclaimer: this program needs to be upgraded from the free version in order to perform some specific actions.
 
### DriverFix
 
 Keep you GPU on the peaks of their performance without worrying about its drivers.

 
Disabling this feature and setting the FPS to your desired value will improve your experience significantly. However, don’t crank it up too much, or it will just result in low FPS.
 
You will find the Framerate Lock feature in the Advanced Settings tab of the Video settings for Far Cry 5. We recommend 60 FPS for starters but, again, it all depends on your PC’s power.
 
### 5. Close background processes 
 
- Search for Task Manager and open the app.
 - Under Processes, look at the apps using the most CPU power, select them and click on End Task.

 
### Far Cry 5 is not using my GPU
 
Although peculiar, as the game automatically recognizes the gaming-dedicated GPUs and uses them as default, there have been cases when it happened.
 
If you are in this situation, press the Esc key when in-game, go to the Monitor tab of the Video settings and, under Video Adapter, select the GPU you want to play on.
 
These are the solutions proven to have resolved lag, stuttering, and low FPS for Far Cry on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.
