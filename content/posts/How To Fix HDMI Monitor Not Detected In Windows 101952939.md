Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Solve the HDMI Monitor Not Detected Issue in Windows 10!

Introduction
Are you having trouble connecting your monitor via HDMI cable to your Windows 10 PC? If yes, don't worry, you're not alone. Many users have faced this issue and found it quite frustrating. However, the good news is that solving the HDMI monitor not detected issue doesn't require you to be a tech-savvy person. In this article, we'll guide you through some simple solutions that will help you fix the problem in no time.

Step 1: Check the Physical Connections
The first and foremost thing you need to do is check the physical connections of your monitor and PC. Ensure that both ends of the HDMI cable are properly plugged in, and none of the pins are bent. If possible, use another HDMI cable and see if the problem persists. Sometimes, a faulty cable can cause the issue.

Step 2: Update the Graphics Card Driver

Now, find the 'Display Adapters' option, and click on it to expand. Right-click on your graphics card and select 'Update driver.' If an update is available, follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

Step 3: Disable Duplicate Screen
Windows 10 has a feature called 'Duplicate Screen,' which allows you to mirror your PC's screen to another display. However, sometimes this feature may interfere with the HDMI connection, resulting in the monitor not detected issue. To disable Duplicate Screen, right-click on your desktop and select 'Display settings.' Now, scroll down to the 'Multiple displays' section and select 'Extend these displays.' This will disable the Duplicate Screen feature.

Step 4: Check the Display Settings
Sometimes, the monitor not detected issue may arise if the display settings are incorrect. To check the settings, right-click on your desktop and select 'Display settings.' Now, under the 'Multiple displays' section, ensure that the 'Extend these displays' option is selected. Also, make sure that the resolution and refresh rate of your monitor are set correctly.

Conclusion
As you can see, solving the HDMI monitor not detected issue in Windows 10 is not rocket science. By following the above steps, you can easily fix the problem and enjoy using your monitor without any hassle. If none of these steps work, you may want to seek help from a professional. Good luck!
