## Chosen Solution
 Changed amp board on sony bdv e3100 home theatre system. The dvd worked for about 10 minutes and then the  volume went out .No sound since but all other function are working

 Hi @hurryharry ,
Here’s the service manual for the player that may help.
Note: The title of the manual says HBD-E3100 but it also says that this is the amplifier, video, HDMI, BD/DVD/CD system, USB, LAN, wireless LAN, Bluetooth, NFC and FM tuner section in a BDV-E3100 player.
Follow the Troubleshooting flowchart from p.34 to find out what has failed and then use the schematics to find out why it failed.
The fault may be obvious as a failed component on the amp board i.e. burnt out component so again the schematics will help.
Sorry to be so vague but when there is a failure you need to start testing and using the schematics as it could be any number of things that caused the failure. At least you’ll have the manual to help you
