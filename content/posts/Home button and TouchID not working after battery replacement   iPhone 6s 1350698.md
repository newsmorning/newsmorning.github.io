## Chosen Solution
 I ordered a battery replacement kit and replaced the old battery in my phone with the new one. The repair went smooth, I didn't have to pry the battery, and I was careful not to damage anything. I turned it back on and the home button and Touch ID are not working at all. I've done a few battery replacements before and have never had a problem. I already tried restarting the phone and I checked to make sure the screen ribbon cables were seated properly.

 Try removing the home button and check it for damage.  If you have another screen try using that to eliminate a problem with the home button extension flex.
