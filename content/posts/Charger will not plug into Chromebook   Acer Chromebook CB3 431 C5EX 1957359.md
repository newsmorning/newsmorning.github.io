Is Your Acer Chromebook Not Charging? Solve Your Frustrating Problem Now - Charger Won't Even Plug In!

If you're an owner of an Acer Chromebook, you know that it's one of the best devices available in the market. However, like any electronic gadget, it can face issues from time to time. One of the most common problems that Acer Chromebook owners face is the device not charging properly, and sometimes, the charger won't even plug in. This issue can be quite frustrating, especially when you have important work to do. But don't worry, as this article will provide you with multiple solutions to solve your problem.

1. Check The Acer Chromebook Charger

The first step is to check the charger of your Acer Chromebook. Sometimes, the charger's port gets clogged with debris, preventing it from charging the device. If you see any debris or dirt, you can use a toothbrush to clean it. If that doesn't fix the issue, check the cable for any signs of damage. Over time, cables tend to get damaged, making them unable to charge the device.

2. Ensure The Power Outlet Is Working Correctly

The next step is to check if the power outlet is working correctly. It is not uncommon for the power outlet to malfunction, preventing your Acer Chromebook from charging. You can use a voltage tester to ensure that the power outlet is working correctly. Alternatively, you can plug in a different device and see if it's charging. If the power outlet is faulty, you can fix it by calling an electrician.

3. Restart The Acer Chromebook

Restarting the Acer Chromebook is an easy solution that many people overlook. A simple restart can often solve the charging issue. To restart the Acer Chromebook, click on the settings icon, then click on the power icon, and click on the restart option.

4. Perform A Power Wash

If the Acer Chromebook is still not charging, performing a power wash can be an effective solution. A power wash is a feature that wipes your device's setting clean and resets it to its original settings. It's essential to note that performing a power wash will erase all your data, so you'll have to backup your data before proceeding with a power wash.

5. Contact Acer's Customer Support

If none of the above solutions seems to work, it's time to contact Acer's customer support. Acer provides excellent customer support that can help you identify the root of the problem and offer a solution. They also provide repair services if the issue can't be solved over the phone.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Acer Chromebook not charging can be a frustrating problem to solve. However, by following the steps provided above, you can quickly identify the issue and solve it in no time. It's essential to note that regular maintenance and taking care of your Acer Chromebook can prevent such issues from occurring in the future. By keeping your Acer Chromebook charging correctly, you can ensure that you have all the resources you need to be productive and efficient.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi!
I went to plug in my Acer Chromebook CB3-431-C5EX this morning and the charger wouldn’t plug in. I looked at the laptop’s charger port and the little metal part that would connect to the charger wasn’t there.
Could I get this fixed or do I have to buy a new laptop?

 Hi @sanriogirl ,
You may be able to repair it yourself.
The DC-In jack (supplier example only) is a plug in module. Search for Acer Chromebook CB3-431-C5EX  DC-In jack to find suppliers that suit you.
Here’s the ifixit Acer Chromebook CB3-431-C5EX Power Port Replacement guide, that shows how to access the charger port (DC-In jack) and to replace it.
Note: When working in a laptop it is safer if you disconnect the battery from the motherboard as soon as you can access it to prevent any possible electrical problems from occurring if you accidentally touch something you shouldn’t when using tools to remove/replace the power port. You don’t have to totally remove the battery just disconnect it. Here’s the ifixit Acer Chromebook CB3-431-C5EX Battery Replacement guide that may help.
The reason for this is that there is always power available at various points on a motherboard when the laptop is off. The power button is not a power isolating button. It merely signals the BIOS as to what is wanted by the user. Think of the laptop as being in an extremely low power state rather than being totally switched off.
Reconnect the battery as late as possible into the reassembly of the laptop. Electronics repair hasn’t changed that much over the years. The 1st rule I learnt over 50 years ago is power off first, on last, unless testing, although this is getting harder these days as the power (battery) is getting harder to access without partially disassembling the device first

 Hi!
This is repairable - the question is whether or not it can be done for a reasonable amount. Find a local shop with a good reputation that does soldering work. They should be able to give you a quote pretty quickly - as a comparison - we do any laptop power jack for $149 at our shop here in Portland, OR.
