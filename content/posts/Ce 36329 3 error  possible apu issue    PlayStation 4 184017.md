Gamers Beware: PlayStation 4 Owners May Be Facing A Terrifying Ce 36329-3 Error Due To An Apu Issue!

As a PlayStation 4 owner, you may have come across the Ce 36329-3 error code. This error may have left you frustrated and confused as it may prevent you from playing your favorite games. The error may also lead to a complete system crash, leaving you with no other option but to restart your console. 

It has recently come to light that the cause of this error may be linked to a faulty Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) in the PlayStation 4 console. The APU is a chip in the console that handles both the processing of game graphics and the performance of the central processing unit (CPU).

The APU is known to overheat, leading to system crashes and the Ce 36329-3 error code. Owners have reported the issue on various forums, such as Twitter and Reddit, highlighting the alarming frequency of the issue.

Experts warn that the issue may be due to the console's faulty design, rather than normal wear and tear. In other words, it may be that the console was not designed to withstand prolonged periods of gameplay.

Gamers are therefore advised to take precautions when playing on the PlayStation 4 console. These precautions may include positioning it in a cool area, monitoring the temperature of the console, and taking regular breaks from gameplay.

If the error persists, it is advisable to reach out to Sony customer support for guidance. Sony is known to offer repairs for affected consoles, but this may come at an additional cost.

The Ce 36329-3 error code and the APU issue are not confined to Sony's PlayStation 4 console. The issue has been identified in the previous-generation PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. It is, however, important for gamers to be aware of the issue, as it may affect their playing experience and gameplay progress.

In conclusion, it is essential to take note of the Ce 36329-3 error code and the underlying APU issue that may affect the PlayStation 4 console. Gamers are advised to take adequate precautions and to contact Sony customer support if they experience the error frequently. With proper care and maintenance of the console, the gaming experience can remain enjoyable and uninterrupted.


## Chosen Solution
 around a year earlier i bought a ps4 og.
at the time of buying , i tested a fifa 16 disc on it , it seemed to play it well without any issues.
some time ago, i bought uncharted 4(uc4) and horizon zero dawn discs.
and the moment the game starts i.e. loads all the assets after like 3-5 seconds after i move using my joystick it freezes, i get a black screen and error 36329-3 pops in.
NOTE- This happens in uc4 and horizon only and not in fifa
At first , i thought this might be lazer or a faulty hdd, so i swapped the hdd with a new wd one which i confirmed to be in good shape. even then i got same issue.
After that i thought maybe its the laser so i downloaded some games (demo/free) from ps store.
Some games like brawlhalla, life is strange episode 1, island cleaner, the adventures of captain spirit, pinball fx3 works fine.
However the detroit become human demo, is giving the same black screen and the error.
Conclusion- the issue arises with heavy/ resource intensive games(mostly 1st party titles like uc4, horizon and detroit are the ones i have confirmed yet)
At this point, i have eliminated the possibility of my hdd and disk drive to be damaged.
The only two issues possible i can think of are
APU DAMAGE - maybe its an apu problem and if so, i think the console is done for.HDD Bandwith issue- highly unlikely but since the issue arises with resource heavy
games only, so maybe if i upgrade to ssd it will do some good?
Is anyne else facing/ heard of this issue.
Looking forward to some assistance.
Thank you

 Logic board issue. Depending on the game engine,PS4 games actually tolerates HDD slowness quite well, textures will pop up when they are loaded. I only found out about this when I installed an HDD not knowing it has auto-stop feature. When the game went quiet, the HDD stops and it will take several seconds to spin it back up, during which all disk I/O not hitting the cache will queue up. The game won’t crash, it just continues with delayed texture or hangs and wait for the I/O. It will only crash when an actual I/O error shows up, like massive timeout, data or command errors.
It is not possible to do meaningful software troubleshooting on the board itself, since almost everything on the board is encrypted to prevent piracy and cheating. What you can do is:
Check board DC-DC converters, see if they were not able to supply peak power,Check bad soldering on the APU or RAM chips,Replace the APU+board flash memory as a set, which is not worth doing.

 I’m leaning towards APU. For the SSD it won’t help with performance compared to a HDD they run roughly the same due to how the games load.

 I have a similar problem with a PS4 Slim.
The CE-36329-3  and CE-34878-0 appear when trying to play a saved game in Horizon or some minutes after playing Need For Speed, respectively.
The console itself runs perfectly and less ram intense games like Fall Guys, NiNoKuni2, CrashBandiCoot, Brawlhala etc. run as they would run on any other PS4.
Games that use a little more ram, like Overwatch, Fifa20, have randomly appearing black lines on the screen, or lots of lines with different colours (Battlefront), or superposed blurry colourful smudges (NBA2K).
Some Games with a high use of ram and graphical performance are full of graphical artefacts (GodOfWar2), yet do not crash.
While a lot of people suggested its the APU (cpu+gpu of the PS4), this type of problems suggests one or more faulty RAM IC CHIPS, due to the fact that each game shows different kind of problems according to the games ram allocation of certain game features. Obviously there are ram modules more crucial than others, and the damage (shorts) to a ram ic chip can be more or less serious.
The “your APU is dying and will probably stops functioning any time soon” argument did not hold true for me. The PS4 Slim works 24/7 as for this day having the issue for over a year.
Reballing RAM chips is almost as expensive as reballing an APU chip, which comes close to purchasing a used PS4 though.
If your PS4 has the same defect as mine you might either buy a used one and sell your for parts, or you could send in your PS4 to sony and get a refurbished one for a fixed fee.
