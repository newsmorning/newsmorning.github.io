# Is Your MacBook Air Dead?! Discover The Surprising Solution To Turning It Back On!

If you're a MacBook Air user, there's probably been a time when your trusty laptop suddenly refused to turn on. This can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially if you depend on your MacBook Air for work or school.

Before you start panicking, know that there's a solution that many people don't know about. In this article, we'll explore the potential reasons why your MacBook Air won't turn on and how to fix it.

## Check your battery

The first thing you should do if your MacBook Air won't turn on is to check your battery. It's possible that your battery has completely drained and needs to be charged. If your MacBook Air is completely unresponsive, try plugging it in and wait a few minutes to see if it starts charging.

If your MacBook Air still won't turn on after being plugged in for a while, you may need to replace the battery. This can be done either through Apple or a third-party repair service. 

## Reset your SMC and PRAM

The SMC (System Management Controller) and PRAM (Parameter RAM) are two components that are responsible for managing your MacBook Air's hardware settings. If either of these components becomes corrupt or misconfigured, your MacBook Air may fail to turn on.

Resetting your SMC and PRAM can sometimes resolve the issue. Here's how to do it:

1. Shut down your MacBook Air completely.
2. Hold down the Shift + Control + Option keys as well as the Power button simultaneously for 10 seconds.
3. Release all keys and the Power button.
4. Press the Power button to turn on your MacBook Air.

If this fails, consider taking your MacBook Air to an Apple Store or authorized repair center for further help.

## Check for loose connections

In some cases, your MacBook Air may not be turning on because of a loose connection. This could be the result of a faulty power adapter, charging port or connector inside the device.

If you suspect a loose connection is the culprit, consider checking the following:

- Make sure your power adapter is securely plugged in.
- Inspect your charging port for debris or damage.
- Check your connector for any signs of damage or dirt.

If none of these work, consider taking your MacBook Air to an authorized repair center or Apple support.

## Conclusion

These are just some of the potential reasons why your MacBook Air isn't turning on. However, don't panic when this happens to you. Try these simple solutions first, and if nothing works, seek a professional repair. In most cases, your MacBook Air can be brought back to life with just a few simple steps, so don't give up on it just yet!

## Chosen Solution
 My laptop (Macbook Air 13” Early 2015) died and the last time I saw it turned on, it was at 15%. I asked my cousin to charge it but when I got it back, it wouldn’t turn on. I know my charger is not the issue because every time I plug it in, it would turn green and then red (hence it was charging). We tried SMC reset and even tried to take the battery out but it’s still dead. I am 100% sure that it didn’t get wet or I didn’t drop it. Is it possible that the board is the problem or is it the battery?

 Lets give this a try follow this guide MacBook Air 13" Early 2015 Battery Replacement to Step 3 with the battery now disconnected carefully put the system on its side so you can reach the power button and MagSafe port.
