Title: The Hidden Glitch in Your MacBook Pro 15 Retina Display After Replacing Your Speakers

Are you noticing a strange glitch in your MacBook Pro 15 retina display after replacing your speakers? You're not alone. Many users have reported a weird issue that affects their display after installing new speakers on their laptop. In this article, we'll take a look at this hidden glitch and what you can do to fix it.

The Problem

The problem occurs when users replace the speakers on their MacBook Pro 15 retina display. After the replacement, they notice a strange glitch that appears on the screen. The glitch looks like a small, bright spot that is always on and can be seen regardless of the application or background. It is particularly noticeable when displaying dark colors.

The glitch can be annoying, especially for graphic designers, photographers, and videographers who require a high-quality display. It can affect their work and lower their productivity.

The Cause

The cause of the glitch is not entirely clear, but it appears to be related to the speaker installation process. When replacing the speakers, the technician may have accidentally damaged the display cable or the connector that attaches the display to the logic board.

The display cable is fragile and can easily break if mishandled. The connector, on the other hand, may become loose or damaged if not properly reattached after the speaker replacement.

The Solution

The solution to this problem is simple. You need to take your MacBook Pro 15 retina display to an authorized Apple service provider or repair center. They will inspect your laptop and determine the cause of the glitch.

If the glitch is related to the display cable, they will replace it with a new one. If the glitch is related to the connector, they will reattach or replace it.

It is important to note that the glitch may not be covered by Apple's warranty if it is caused by third-party repair or modification. Therefore, it is best to have your MacBook Pro 15 retina display repaired by a certified Apple technician.

Conclusion

If you're experiencing a glitch in your MacBook Pro 15 retina display after replacing your speakers, don't panic. The problem is fixable, and you can get back to work in no time. Take your laptop to an authorized Apple service provider or repair center, and let them take care of the issue. It's always best to leave repairs and modifications to the experts to avoid hidden glitches and further damage to your device.

 Hello Guys,
a month ago i decided to change the speakers by myself they were in a bad quality , everything was well i changed them also i found some dust on board and i clean it with alcoholic paper and a hair dryer o Warm air i assume this is the problem,
after reinstalling the battery and the cover and booom no screen but i hear the chime that means we have a problem now is with the screen , days after i heard about the backlight problem i light the flash from the back i can see the login user , i tried an external screen and it worked , now and since a month i’am always using it with external screen, imagine when i go anywhere always looking for a tv to use it  , i took it to a reparator he said 600EUR just for backlight problem !!
now i would like to confirm where is the problem exactly , i attached some pictures maybe one of you can help and see the bug , i already changed the lvds cable to check but it wasn't the problem so it’s might be lvds connector or the fuse ? and what i need to fix it



Thank you guys :)

 Sounds like your repair did more damage then fixing things ;-{
wiping down a logic board with wet wipes is not a good idea more so if you still had the battery plugged in. To add to it you used a hair drier which could build up a static charge (ESD) and if the drier touched the wrong place you could zap your logic board.
Time to find an independent repair person who has the skills and tools to repair your logic board.
