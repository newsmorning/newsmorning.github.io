Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When We Changed the Glass on a Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display Late 2013 - Prepare to be Amazed!

If you own a MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Late 2013, you know how important it is to keep your device functioning properly. But what happens when something goes wrong? Recently, our team experienced a problem with the glass on our Macbook Pro, and we decided to change it. But what happened next was truly amazing, and we couldn't believe our eyes! 

First, we observed that the glass was cracked, and it needed to be replaced. We searched the internet for the best solution and got in touch with a reputed service provider who could help us. After a detailed phone call, we scheduled an appointment with them, and they promised us a convenient, timely, and hassle-free service. 

On the day of the appointment, the technician arrived with all the necessary tools and equipment. He introduced himself and patiently explained the entire process that he would undertake to change the glass. We handed over the device to him and waited anxiously for the repair to be done. 

After a few minutes, the technician called us over and presented our device to us. We couldn't recognize our Macbook Pro at first sight. It looked new, as if it had just come out of the box. The technician had not only replaced the glass but had also given the device a thorough cleaning. 

The screen was so clear and sharp; we were amazed! It was as if we were looking at a new device. We played a few videos, scrolled through some web pages, opened multiple applications, and everything worked seamlessly. We were impressed by the speed and responsiveness of our device, and we couldn't help but smile. 

The technician also informed us that he had used the highest quality glass material that was compatible with our device. He had ensured that every component was working correctly, and had left no room for any errors or defects. We appreciated the attention to detail and the professionalism of the technician. 

In conclusion, changing the glass on our Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display Late 2013 was an incredible experience. We were initially worried about the repair process and the potential costs involved. However, we are impressed by the service provider and how they handled the repair. Seeing our device back to its original condition and running smoothly was a satisfying feeling. We highly recommend anyone with similar issues to get in touch with the experts and experience the same level of service and satisfaction.

 Hello Ifixit
I have a Macbook Pro 13" Retina from 2014.
It works perfectly fine, but unfortunately there are "dull" parts on the glass (not on the display), which are visible especially in daylight.
1. Is it possible to change just the glass on a Retina?
2. Can you use chemicals off any kind to repair the glass?
Thank you for your answers.

 Absolutely impossible to change just the glass. The LCD is glued to the top case and the adhesive used is stronger than the LCD panel itself. Any attempt to pull it off simply disintegrates the panel or leave bubbles inside it.
Due to this, it is not even possible to repair the camera or hinge, any hardware damage on the top case  equals replacing the whole top half.
