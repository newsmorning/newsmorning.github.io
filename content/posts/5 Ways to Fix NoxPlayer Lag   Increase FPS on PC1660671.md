Stop Suffering from Noxplayer Lag: Discover 5 Easy Tricks to Boost FPS on Your PC!

Online gaming has been rapidly increasing in popularity, especially with the emergence of mobile gaming platforms like Noxplayer. Although Noxplayer offers a seamless gaming experience, some users experience lag, causing frustration and interrupting gameplay. The good news is that you can boost your FPS (frames per second) and eliminate Noxplayer lag with just a few simple tricks.

Here are five easy tips to help you boost FPS on your PC:

1. Optimize Your Graphics Settings
You should adjust your graphics settings based on your PC's capabilities to ensure a smooth gaming experience. To do this, launch Noxplayer and go to the settings. Set the quality to the lowest possible setting and adjust the resolution to 800×600 pixels. This will reduce the strain on your PC and increase your FPS.

2. Update Your Graphics Card Drivers
Regularly updating your graphics card drivers is vital for optimum performance. Go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer and download the latest version of the driver that supports your graphics card model.

3. Close Background Apps
Closing any unnecessary apps running in the background is vital in increasing your FPS. When too many programs use up your PC's resources, your FPS will decrease. To resolve this, open your Task Manager, locate and close any unnecessary apps.

4. Increase Your PC's RAM
Insufficient RAM can be a critical factor that slows down your PC. Consider upgrading your PC's RAM to at least 8GB to ensure a seamless gaming experience.

5. Use Game Boosters
There are many game boosters available online that can improve your PC's performance. Steam provides an in-built option called the "Steam In-Game Overlay." When you enable this option, you can optimize your PC's performance while playing games.

In conclusion, these tips can help you to enhance your FPS and reduce Noxplayer lag. Optimizing your graphics settings, updating your graphics card drivers, closing background apps, increasing your PC’s RAM, and using game boosters are all effective methods to boost your FPS. Try them now and enjoy your Noxplayer gaming experience like never before.

 - In the Run box, input Dxdiag.
 - Select OK. This will bring up your PC’s BIOS details.
 - After bringing up your BIOS details, you can then run BIOS to activate the VT embedded in it.

 
Virtual Technology (VT) comes inbuilt with most standard computers. However, most times, the VT function is usually disabled, in which case, you are bound to experience some lags while running the NoxPlayer.
 
- If it is, then something else is causing the lag; otherwise. proceed with the next steps. VT is usually embedded in a PC’s BIOS.

 
To resolve this issue, all you need to do is to enable the VT setting on your system, and you’ll experience a significant boost in the running speed..
 
The procedure for running BIOS varies across platforms. Hence, depending on your system’s build, the procedure outlined herein might not work for you.

Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

This procedure works in sync with the virtual technology function; hence, if your system does not support VT, you can’t fix NoxPlayerlag using this procedure.
 
If you are still experiencing lags, you can change the graphics rendering mode (under Advanced settings).
 
Note: In trying to improve NOX performance via CPU and RAM customization, ensure to leave sufficient CPU and RAM space for the computer to run other system operations. Failure to do this might result in an eventual system crash.

 - Navigate to the “Global Settings” tab.
 - Under the “Preferred graphics processor” drop-down, select “High performance NVIDIA processor”.

 
Like most emulators, NoxPlayer requires a standard graphics setup to function properly. So, if you are experiencing lags, the problem could be from your system graphics cards (or GPU setup).
 
The ultimate solution in this case, is to increase the performance of your system’s GPU, specifically the graphics cards. Although there is a number of ways to do this, we’ll be showing you the standard ones in this section.

 - On the Select a program to customize drop-down, select NoxPlayer.
 - Under the second drop-down menu, select High-performance NVIDIA processor.
 - Press Apply to save changes.
 - And you are all set!

 
For AMD:
 
Note: This process requires two sets of graphics cards. Hence, you need to check if you have two graphics cards on your system.
 
- Click on the Windows + R keys (to open the Run dialog box).
 - Type devmgmt.msc in the box (to launch Device Manager).
 - Click on Display adapters to display the graphics card(s).

NoxPlayer is one of the most prominent Android emulators in the market. And it is designed to run at optimum capacity, in sync, with a host PC. Hence, in the event of performance reduction or lag, the primary problem is usually caused by the host computer.
