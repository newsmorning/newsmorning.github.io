**Is Your iPod Touch 4th Generation Home Button NOT Clicking? Here's the Surprising Solution!**

If you are a proud owner of an iPod Touch 4th Generation, you know that the home button is a crucial component that allows you to navigate between apps and return to the home screen. However, over time, it's not uncommon for the home button to stop working correctly. If you've noticed that your iPod Touch 4th Generation home button isn't clicking, you may not think that there's a simple solution. But, fortunately, there is!

The problem with the home button is usually due to a buildup of dirt and grime around the edges of the button. It can hinder the button's ability to click and, in some cases, make it unresponsive. Many people will first try to clean the button with a cloth or even a sharp object. However, that can lead to further damage if done incorrectly.

The surprising solution to this problem is to use rubbing alcohol, a cotton swab, and a pair of tweezers. Here's how you can do it yourself:

1. Turn off your iPod Touch 4th Generation to prevent any accidents.

2. Get a cotton swab and dip it in some rubbing alcohol. Make sure to squeeze out any excess liquid before starting.

3. Using the tweezers, remove any visible dirt or debris that may surround the home button.

4. Once you have removed as much dirt as possible, swipe the cotton swab around the edge of the button gently.

5. Let the rubbing alcohol dry out completely, which should only take about a minute or two.

6. Check to see if the home button is now clicking correctly. If it still isn't working, try the process again or contact a professional.

You'd be surprised how many people use this DIY method, as it solves the issue for many people. It's a quick, easy, and inexpensive solution that doesn't require you to take apart your iPod Touch or take it to a store for repairs, saving you time and money in the process.

In conclusion, if your iPod Touch 4th Generation home button isn't clicking, don't panic. It's likely just dirt and grime buildup that's causing the issue. You can use rubbing alcohol, a cotton swab, and a pair of tweezers to clean the button, and in no time, it should be clicking like new again. Be sure to attempt this DIY fix at your own risk, and if you have any doubts, it's best to contact a professional.

## Chosen Solution
 Replaced the LCD and Digitizer on an IPod 4 touch. All seems to work, but the home button has lost its ability to "click", pushing down on the home button does not respond. Does it mean that the rubber gasket is shot, or did I lose some spring or similar small part? The button looks OK.

 Look at this picture of the home button controller:

That is the part that is responsible for that clicking action. That part is probably out of place, missing or broken. I would take the panel off (sorry, I know it's not easy) and see if you can see the home button controller. Check and see if the whole assembly is intact and if it's in the right spot. I'd also try to depress the button as well and see if you can't get that clicking action to work.

 About the small black dot:
I had a similar problem with my ipod 4's home button suddenly not working. I opened it up, and removed a mysterious piece of black plastic that was wedged in there. In the process, I accidentally stuck that black dot to my thumb. I attempted to get it back on, and lost it. I was able to fix it with two VERY SMALL pieces of electrical tape( think two corner tips from one piece). I just stuck it on, and the ipod worked fine. In addition to that, the ipod has an electronic home button, activated via settings-general-accessibility-assistive touch. Just turn that on, and a white dot will then take up a corner of the screen. Upon tapping the dot, you are presented with a home button, voice control, and various other options. Hope this helps!

 What you have to do is glue a small piece of plastic onto the gol/yellow dot that clicks.

 I've seen the guide for replacing the home button controller, but not where to buy one: are they available?

 I have the same problem after i took the Ipod apart to replace the digitizer i must have lost the "little black dot"
I dont want to replace the entire home button controller so ill try the ideas above.
Does anyone know how big the piece of plastic or tape needs to be?

 If your iPod home button is not working at all you can however add an alternative home button called assistive touch. This works with iOS 5 and up. Go to settings-general-accessibility-assistive touch on. A little white circle appears. If you tap it, it gives you 4 options. You can move it anywhere you want on your screen. My home button stopped working and that assistive touch feature saved my life! It's not as great as the home button though because it takes 2 taps to get to the home screen but it's better than nothing. It's a life saver!!

 I've just tried the electrical tape method on an ipod 5, whilst it worked for a while I found the tape was moving around after a while. Eventually settled on a piece of card a little less than 1mm square, about 120gsm held in place by a piece of masking tape dead centre of the round bit, I first tried to glue it place, but that didn't work nor did trying to super glue the original black bit back on that just seemed to disolve.

 I had the exact same problem I have not fixed it but do u know how hard it is to put that little orange peace on?? Bc I can get one.

 Same problem here on an iPod 1st. Replaced digitizer and now no click. Mine didn’t have a black dot. Just the gold circle. Electrical tape didn’t work on first gen. Anyone have any luck with this?
