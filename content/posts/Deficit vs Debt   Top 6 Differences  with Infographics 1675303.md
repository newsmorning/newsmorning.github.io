# You won't believe the shocking differences between deficit and debt! Get visually stunned with our top 6 infographics!

When it comes to government finances, the terms "deficit" and "debt" are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to very different things. Understanding the difference between the two is crucial for anyone interested in finance or politics, and luckily, we've gathered some of the best infographics to help you understand.

## 1. What is the deficit?

Simply put, the deficit is the amount of money the government spends in excess of the revenue it brings in during a given period, usually a fiscal year. This money is typically made up by borrowing from the public, both domestically and internationally. However, with a growing deficit, the government must pay interest on this borrowed money, which makes it harder to pay off the debt and creates a vicious cycle.

## 2. The cost of the deficit

The cost of the deficit can be hard to visualize, but this infographic puts it into perspective. In 2019 alone, the US government spent almost $1 trillion more than it brought in, adding to the national debt.

## 3. What is the debt?

The debt is the total amount of money that the government has borrowed over time to make up for deficits or to invest in long-term projects. This is the sum of all the government's outstanding loans.

## 4. Cracking the debt

The amount of debt the government carries is staggering - this infographic shows the number in the trillions. Trillions of dollars can be a difficult number to comprehend, but this graphic breaks down the debt into slices, explaining how much of the debt goes where.

## 5. The ticking debt clock

With the debt continuing to grow every day, this infographic illustrates the urgency of the situation. The national debt is likened to a ticking bomb and visualizes the rate of increase in real-time. It's alarming to see that the debt increases by thousands of dollars every second.

## 6. Comparing the deficit to the debt

Finally, this infographic highlights the difference between deficit and debt by showing them side-by-side. While the deficit can be measured year-to-year, the debt is a long-term accumulation of this debt. This graphic explains how the deficit can lead to the debt.

In summary, while the terms "deficit" and "debt" may sound similar, they are very different concepts. Understanding the difference is crucial for anyone interested in finance, economics, or politics. These six infographics demonstrate the staggering difference between the two and the real-life implications of a growing deficit and debt.
