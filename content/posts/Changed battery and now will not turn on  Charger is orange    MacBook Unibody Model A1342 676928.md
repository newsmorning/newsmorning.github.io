Title: Did Changing Your Macbook Battery Just Kill Your Laptop? See Why the Charger is Stuck on Orange for Model A1342!

Introduction:
If you're a MacBook user, you're probably familiar with the blinking orange light on the charger. Usually, it indicates that your laptop is charging, but what happens when it's stuck on orange even after you've changed your MacBook battery? It's a frustrating situation, but don't worry – you're not alone. In this article, we'll explore why your Macbook charger is stuck on orange for model A1342 after replacing your battery and what you can do about it.

Main body:
When you replace the battery of your MacBook, the laptop can recognize that you've made a change, and the charger gets stuck on orange. In this case, it's likely that you have a bad battery or the battery is not connected to the laptop correctly. You should make sure that you have installed the battery correctly into the laptop. Also, you should check if your battery is compatible with your MacBook model.

Another possible cause of your charger being stuck on orange is a faulty charger. The charger may have gone bad or may be damaged. Check if the charger is working correctly by checking if it works with another MacBook or if another charger works with your MacBook.

The MacBook's SMC (System Management Controller) may also be responsible for the problem. SMC is responsible for controlling various system functions such as power management and battery charging. If it gets confused, the charger may stop charging the battery. To fix this, you should reset the SMC. To do this, you should shut down your MacBook, connect the charger, press and hold the Shift, Control, and Option keys together with the power button for ten seconds. This will reset the SMC, and your charger should start working correctly again.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the MacBook charger being stuck on orange after replacing your battery is a common problem. It can be due to a bad battery, an incorrect installation of the battery, a faulty charger, or a confused SMC. To fix the issue, you should check to make sure that the battery is installed correctly, the battery is compatible with your MacBook model, the charger is working correctly, and reset the SMC if necessary. With these tips, you can get back to enjoying your MacBook without any more charging issues.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, i recently got a 2010 MacBook unibody. It was stuck in a boot loop, replaced the hdd and turned on, but then it would click off randomly. I managed to get around that by holding the eject key which seemed to keep it on, and i managed to download OS X Yosemite over 3 hours successfully. So all working, apart from the charger would stay green, and if i took it out it would shut off. So dead battery. In the battery tab on the tool bar it said battery needs replacing, not charging. So put another battery in from a MacBook I’m using for parts, the first time i did it i forgot to put the battery cable in, plugged it in and charger was green, opened it up again and realised it was not connected so connected the battery properly and now the charger is orange, but it will not turn on anymore?!?! Any ideas?!?!? Was working fine before apart from the “Click” and shutoff when i wasn’t holding the eject key. Thanks!

 Leave the mag-safe adapter plugged in until the amber light goes off.  Then try starting it up.  You currently don’t know if the replacement battery is any good either.
