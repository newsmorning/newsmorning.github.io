Eliminate Samsung Galaxy S8 Back Glass Woes for Good with our Expert Adhesive Tips!

The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a beautifully designed phone, with its curved edges and smooth glass back. However, this glass back can cause a headache for those who drop their phone or accidentally crack the back. Fortunately, there are ways to fix this issue, with the right adhesive tips.

The first step is to determine the type of adhesive you need. There are two types of adhesive commonly used for Samsung Galaxy S8 back glass repair. The first is a pre-cut adhesive, which is specifically designed for the Samsung Galaxy S8. The second is a generic adhesive, which can be used on any type of phone.

Pre-cut adhesive is generally more expensive than generic adhesive, but it is easier to use and can be more effective in repairing the back glass. To use pre-cut adhesive, you simply need to place it over the back glass and press it down firmly. The adhesive should cover the entire back glass, with no gaps or air bubbles.

If you decide to use generic adhesive, you may need to cut it to size yourself. This can be a bit more complicated, but it can also save you money. You will need to measure the back glass and cut the adhesive to the correct size. Once you have cut the adhesive, you can slide it into place and press it down firmly.

Regardless of which type of adhesive you choose, there are a few key tips to remember. Firstly, make sure the back glass is clean and free from any dirt, dust, or grease. Use a microfiber cloth to remove any debris from the back glass.

Secondly, use rubbing alcohol to clean the back glass. This will help to remove any residue or oils on the surface, making it easier for the adhesive to stick.

Finally, when applying the adhesive, be sure to press down firmly and evenly. This will ensure the adhesive adheres to the back glass properly, preventing any air bubbles from forming.

By following these expert adhesive tips, you can eliminate Samsung Galaxy S8 back glass woes for good. Whether you choose pre-cut or generic adhesive, ensure you clean the back glass thoroughly and apply the adhesive evenly and firmly. A repaired back glass will not only provide better protection for your phone, but also restore its original beautiful design.

## Chosen Solution
 I purchased the rear cover adhesive from iFixit to replaced the battery.  Everything went well until I started the apply the the cover adhesive.  I found this step to be very difficult. I am not sure if I did it correctly?   Can someone tell me what part of the adhesive stays on the back cover ?  Is it ONLY the narrow (sliver) piece that fits around the perimeter ?   If so, I found that this sliver of adhesive not to be sticky on BOTH sides .  Is there a video online that fully illustrates how this part is installed ?  Many thanks

 Looking at the kit provided by iFixit, I believe you have 3 separate adhesive pieces for the rear cover. Before starting you will need to remove all leftover adhesive for a good seal.
The large rectangle piece needs to be attached black side to the frame and/or silver side to the back coverThe “U” shaped island adhesive needs to go around the rear camera (should fit visual cues around camera)The last island adhesive piece needs to be attached on the bottom (again should fit visual cues)
The island pieces are black on both sides but will only fit one way. Hope this helps!
