# Revive Your iPhone 5 in Minutes with Lightning Connector Replacement and Factory Reset - Unlock Hidden Features!

If you're still holding onto your beloved iPhone 5, it's likely that you're starting to experience some wear and tear on your device. One common issue that can happen is a damaged lightning connector that can prevent your phone from charging and syncing. But fear not, because replacing the lightning connector on your iPhone 5 can be a simple fix that can revive your phone in minutes!

In addition to replacing the lightning connector, performing a factory reset on your iPhone 5 can also unlock some hidden features you may not have known existed. Here's how to revamp your iPhone 5 in a few easy steps.

## Replacing the Lightning Connector

First things first, let's talk about how to replace the damaged lightning connector on your iPhone 5. You'll need a few tools for this process, such as a pentalobe screwdriver, a plastic spudger, and a replacement lightning connector. You can find replacement lightning connectors online or at your local electronics store.

1. Power off your iPhone 5 by holding down the power button until the "slide to power off" option appears. Slide to power off.

2. Use the pentalobe screwdriver to remove the two screws at the bottom of the phone near the lightning connector.

3. Use the plastic spudger to gently pry open the bottom of the phone. Be careful not to pry too hard or you could damage other parts of your phone.

4. Locate the lightning connector and unplug it from the logic board.

5. Replace the lightning connector with the replacement part and plug it back into the logic board.

6. Put the bottom of the phone back together and screw in the two screws with the pentalobe screwdriver.

7. Power on your phone and test the lightning connector to ensure that it is working properly.

## Performing a Factory Reset

Now that your lightning connector is fixed, it's time to perform a factory reset on your iPhone 5. This will erase all of the data on your phone, so make sure to back up any important photos, files, or contacts before proceeding.

1. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.

2. Enter your passcode if prompted.

3. Confirm that you want to erase all content and settings. Your phone will restart and the factory reset process will begin.

4. Once the process is complete, set up your phone as if it were new again.

## Unlocking Hidden Features

Performing a factory reset can do more than just erase your data; it can also reveal some hidden features on your iPhone 5. Here are a few things you may not have known existed on your phone:

* Voice Memos: Did you know that you can record audio memos on your iPhone 5? Simply swipe up from the home screen and tap the microphone icon to start recording.

* Burst Mode: If you're trying to capture a fast-moving object, such as your pet or your child, try using burst mode. Simply hold down the shutter button to take multiple photos in rapid succession.

* Custom Vibrations: You can create custom vibrations for different contacts or alerts. Go to Settings > Sounds > Ringtone > Vibration > Create New Vibration to set up your own unique vibration pattern.

In conclusion, reviving your iPhone 5 doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. By replacing the lightning connector and performing a factory reset, you can bring new life to your phone and even unlock some hidden features you may not have known existed. So, take a few minutes to give your phone some TLC and enjoy using it for many more years to come!

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced lightning and headphone part successfully in iPhone 5 according to iFixit guide but at reboot iPhone is as new device,  like if I reset it to factory default and It asks to configure it as new iPhone.
It’s possible part replacement can cause factory reset?
iPhone is tuned off for many many months.
What happened?

 No, the phone de-activated itself meaning you’ll need to re-activate the phone either via 3UTools / iTunes or by going through the setup which will most likely ask for the Apple ID that was signed into iCloud on that phone.
Data should be there as devices only are factory reset from restoring the phone or resetting through settings.

 When I turn on It I have to choose Language, Country, Apple id … the same thing like a hard reset.
So you think if I configure device typing original Apple id I can restore data?
