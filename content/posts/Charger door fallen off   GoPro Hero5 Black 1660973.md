## Chosen Solution
 So my go pro hero black 5 is only 2 weeks old. And I’m overseas diving and snorkeling and the go pro fell off a little coffee table and the door to the charger port has come off. Is there anyway of fixing this without putting it into a shop??

 Um of course yeah. I have a hero 5 and it’s basicly a latch. Not so easy to get it back in but yes it can surely be done.
