We purchased the Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Keyboard so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

Most premium gaming keyboards are big, beastly devices—but not the Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard. While it keeps the vibrant rainbow of lighting animations seen on most contemporaries, this high-end option is super-slim and features low-profile keys that hit a sweet spot between traditional keyboards and laptop keys.

 

That makes it an outlier in a field full of very similar-looking gaming accessories, but the stylish look and speedy typing on these clicky keys make the Logitech G915 Lightspeed a great pick—particularly for those who will actually use it for work and everyday use. It is very pricey, however, and the lack of any kind of wrist rest is a curious omission.

 

I tested the Logitech G915 Lightspeed for more than a week as my everyday keyboard, both while gaming and during my everyday writing and editing work routine.

 
##   Design: Surprisingly svelte  
 

Glowing keys aside, the Logitech G915 Lightspeed just doesn’t look or feel much like a typical gaming keyboard. It’s amazingly thin at 22mm, with a dense and slim casing made from brushed 5052 aluminum alloy on the top and plastic on the bottom.

 
This high-end option is super-slim and features low-profile keys that hit a sweet spot between traditional keyboards and laptop keys.
 

The low-profile keys look like they’re just floating atop the stylish base, and while there isn’t as much light pouring out from under the keys as you’ll see on many mechanical gaming keyboards, the colorful RGB light shining individually through the letters, numbers, and symbols themselves is bright and colorful.

 

This wireless model can connect in a few different ways, too. It ships with a tiny USB receiver nub that plugs into your computer for speedy “Lightspeed” connectivity, promising a low-latency 1ms link to your desktop or laptop. You can also use Bluetooth, if you please, which is ideal for devices without a full-sized USB port, and also makes it easy to switch between multiple devices. The included, detachable USB cable can be used for connectivity and/or charging.

 

The feet beneath the keyboard are cleverly adjustable, letting you choose either 4 or 8 degrees of elevation. While I found it less necessary given the low-profile approach compared to other keyboards, the omission of any kind of wrist rest here is curious.

Along the top of the keyboard are soft-touch settings buttons and media control, including the ability to choose between multiple settings profiles, control the brightness, and switch between Lightspeed and Bluetooth connectivity. Meanwhile, the dedicated media buttons are found in the upper right corner beneath the smooth-scrolling rolling volume control.

 
##   Performance: It really clicks  
 

Logitech’s G915 Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard employs low-profile GL key switches—and clicky ones in this particular configuration. As the look of the keyboard suggests, these keys don’t travel quite as much as on many full-sized keyboards, with an actuation distance of just 1.5mm and a total travel distance of 2.7mm.

 

There’s less travel here, for sure, but also quite a bit more than your average laptop keyboard. That puts it right in a sweet spot for someone like me who usually works directly from a laptop; there’s a more natural learning curve when I sit at my desk and use this keyboard instead. My fingers fly over these rapidly-actuated keys, with the audible click pairing well with the tactile sensation of fully depressing each key.

 

It works great for games and typing alike, although there aren’t any specialized keycaps that you can swap in like with some rival options, such as Corsair’s mechanical gaming keyboards. The bigger potential hitch is likely to come for people who are solely used to full-sized keyboards, as the lesser key travel here is definitely noticeable.

 

Logitech pins the battery life at 30 hours of usage with the key lighting at 100 percent brightness, and that kind of estimate rang true in my testing. Depending on how much you use the keyboard, it may be sensible to charge it once weekly, or perhaps biweekly. The included USB-to-micro USB cable makes it easy to top up the keyboard while it’s in use, and you can check the current battery level via Logitech’s G Hub software. You’ll also get notifications when it’s low.

##   Comfort: Wrist rest optional (because it’s missing)  
 

While it’s odd that this $250 keyboard doesn’t feature a wrist rest of any sort, ultimately the low-profile nature makes it comfortable to use even without a cushion beneath. As mentioned, I found it very easy to adapt to these keys as a laptop-centric user, and that made it easier for me to get up to full speed as opposed to a slower learning curve with some other gaming keyboards.

 
##   Software: The G Hub  
 

Logitech’s G Hub for Windows or Mac is the software you’ll use to configure and manage the Logitech G915 Lightspeed’s lighting animations and settings, as well as configure macro keys and other options. Along with several preset options for lighting animations across the entire keyboard, you can customize animation cycles and set certain colors for specific keys.

##   Price: It’s a sizable investment  
 

At $250, the Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a very expensive option, with the price seemingly boosted by its super-thin design, specialized keys, and wireless nature. There is a wired Logitech G815 alternative for $200 that is otherwise nearly identical, and that may be a better option for anyone buying a gaming keyboard for a fixed desk setup. With the wireless G915, you’re definitely paying a premium for the versatility of a device that can also connect via Bluetooth to phones, tablets, and more.

 
##   Logitech G915 Wireless vs. Corsair K95 RGB Platinum XT  
 

These are two excellent, high-end mechanical gaming keyboards, but they are very different in feel and execution. By contrast, Corsair’s K95 RGB wired keyboard is robust and full-sized, and it packs bonus features in the form of swappable keycaps ideal for first-person shooters and MOBA games. It also appeals to video game streamers via integration with Elgato Stream Deck and specialized included keycaps for the macro buttons.

 
With the wireless G915, you’re definitely paying a premium for the versatility of a device that can also connect via Bluetooth to phones, tablets, and more.
 

Both provide great lighting and smooth typing, but in different ways. If you’re not keen on a low-profile board with shorter-travel keys, then Corsair’s $200 K95 RGB Platinum XT might be a better option for you.

 
One seriously impressive and versatile keyboard.
