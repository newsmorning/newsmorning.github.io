Title: Is This The End for Your iPod? Home Button Stuck and Won't Turn On: iPod Touch 5th Generation Troubleshooting Tips Inside!

Introduction:
iPod Touch 5th Generation is a popular portable media player released by Apple in 2012. The device is equipped with a lot of exciting features and capabilities such as a home button, touch screen display, and camera. However, despite its durability, users sometimes experience issues such as a stuck home button and device won't turn on. This could be frustrating but don't throw it away just yet. This article provides troubleshooting tips on how to fix a stuck home button and power up your iPod Touch 5th Generation.

Troubleshooting Tips:
1. Charge your device: The first thing to check when your iPod Touch won't turn on is the battery. Plug your device into a power source and wait for a few minutes. If the screen turns on, then the battery was the issue. If not, proceed to the next step.

2. Home button problem: Sometimes, the home button can get stuck, preventing the device from turning on. Try pressing the home button repeatedly with a little bit of force. If this doesn't work, try cleaning the home button with a soft cloth or a cotton bud, and check for any debris that might be stuck under the button.

3. Check the power button: If the home button isn't stuck, the power button could be the issue. Try pressing and holding the power button for at least 10 seconds. If your device still doesn't turn on, try connecting it to your computer via USB cable and see if it turns on.

4. Restore your device: If none of these steps work, it's time to restore your device using iTunes. Connect your iPod Touch to your computer, open iTunes, and click on the restore button. This will erase all data on your device, so make sure you have a backup.

Conclusion:
Don't give up on your iPod Touch 5th Generation just yet if it won't turn on. Troubleshoot the device on your own to find out what's causing the problem. By following these tips, you can get your iPod Touch up and running again. Remember to always check your device's battery, home button, power button, and try restoring your device to factory settings through iTunes. Good luck and enjoy your media player again!

## Chosen Solution
 The home button to my 5th gen ipod broke about two months ago, and just today the screen went black and wouldn't come back on. I know it was charged, and even if it wasn't, if I plugged it into the power adapter it would have come on, but it didn't. I read that pressing the home button and the power button at the same time usually fixes this probably, but my home button is broken so I cannot do that. is there anything else I can do?

 I have the same problem, but there's only two things you can do.
1. Wait a day,or two, or maybe 3 and plug your charger on. Thats what i did. i think its basically needing a break cause of how long you run your phone without powering it off much. Or other things its just too hot and needs to cool off.
2. Take it somewhere like a lowkey place where they fix ipod,phones, & etc for cheap prices instead of going to apple cause apple is gonna give you the dumb response you dont wanna hear which is "I cant help you, gotta buy a new one". <- example.
Contact my email @ shaylarodriguez10@yahoo.com if you want free repair for your ipod, iphone, or whatever needs repaired. I check my email everyday soo...

 Same happened to me, I just followed the first few steps of the ipod display replacement guide until the screen is lifted then using a point or a pen hold down the contact under the home button and power button and you should be good to go assuming there is some power in the battery then just re-assemble and enjoy.

 This happens quite alot with mine. Usually happens because of not closing off apps and they have crashed which causes it to turn into black screen.  As my home button is broke, what works with me is either leave the ipod for a few days depending how much charge it had in it and wait for the charging icon to appear, and then charge it, it should come back on. Or try charging it for an hour, see if the apple icon appears. The first idea i'd say is most useful.
If both your buttons work then hold them down together and apple icon should appear.

 what i did was go on find my iphone and i clicked on lost mode and the apple logo appeared on my screen in like a few seconds! That also does work

 Same happened to me. A lot of times and I had it on fully charged. The first time i just left it alone and after 3,4 days i plugged it on the charger, and in a couple of minutes it turned  back on. But it happened again a month later and recently last week on full charge so what  i did was put it in the freezer, facedown(i heard its safer that way) and it only took one day to drain. #FREEZERTRICK

 my friend  told me to plug my ipod in and let it charge so I left it plugedd in and it turnd back on so try leving it pluged in

 Guys, I had this issue (iPod touch won't turn on, iTunes wouldn't recognize it, home button was broken for almost 2 years. Tried everything, then I was !#^&@@ off so I tried to remove the home button (whatever tool you can think of). After like an hour, I was able to remove this little peace of sh*t, then  the home button would actually work, cause I didn't damage the part under it. Then I just did the simple reset (hold power plus whats under the home button for 10 seconds) and it worked like a charm. Give it a shot if you're as desperate as I was. now my iPod touch looks weird but I retreived my home button so it's even better then before.

 let it sit without the charger, and the battery dies and every now & then hold the top button to see if you get the little charging symbol on the bottom, basically telling you to connect it to the charger, also don't leave it on the charger over night because the home button is hitting on of the cords on the inside telling the ipod that it is overcharged, so at night turn the ipod off as normal, and DO NOT charge. Some times if you know that you will not be using the ipod for long periods of time, keep the ipod on a low battery percentage so if it turns off, it will take less time for the battery to die, do this at night if you chose to leave ipod on.

 I had the same problem too and i was on the verge of crying because i don't know what to do so i searched for solutions and after an hour i found and tried many. Now my iPod works great.
This is what i did
1. I went to www.icloud.com and i signed in my apple account. i opened the Find my Iphone Icon and then I clicked the Play Sound icon and miraculously my Ipod touch opened and played an annoying sound but it only displayed the assistive touch with the black screen. I tried pressing the home icon in the assistive touch while pressing the power button and hoping that the apple logo would appear but it didn't. I tried it for over 20 minutes but it still didn't work.
2. So I downloaded Tenorshare Reiboot. After installing and running it the charging cable appeared with the itunes logo. After a few minutes the Apple logo appeared.
3. the apple Logo was stuck and i waited for a minute and it worked.
I hope this helps.

 Same thing happened to me just a few minutes ago. I was doing research and someone told me to keep it charging over night so I did as so and the next morning I woke and it turned back on.

 let your ipod die then charge it it should turn back on

 Alright, so this has happened to me a few times before. My home button doesn't work and the screen when dark, I let it charge for 2-3 days, and it turned back on immediately. Honestly, Apple has no clue what happened because i've called multiple times and no one knows.

 This has happened to me multiple times. My home button is also broken. I plugged it into a computer, opened itunes and made a backup. Although the screen was blank it connected to itunes. I think its to do with the screen. After I made a backup I restored it to factory default. It turned on fine. Then you could restore it from the backup. I haven't tried doing it straight from the backup but that might work too.

 U might have to send it back to apple and call them and let them know what's going on

 Drain your apple devices battery which could take from 1 day to a week ( I know i'm sorry) but trust me this works my ipod 5gen has done this more then 4 times so just put it down and wait keep pressing the sleep button to check if anything pops up usually it will tell you it is dead so when the charging screen appears go charge it and it should be fine

 This happened to me to but it works and my iPod will turn on but when you press it instead of pressing soft and having it go back to the main page or whatever I have to press really hard or it won't work

 I had this problem with my sons ipod you need to let it go dead flat it might take a day or two and wen it does keep preesing the on /off button until you see the battery bar then you charge it and you should see the apple logo after about 5mins then  it should start reseting itself i couldnt believe it actually worked

 I'm having the same problem, and from what I've read online it says to leave the IPod alone for a few minutes, alone as in not trying to charger and whatnot. I am currently trying  it out myself and I've heard that it certainly does work.

 My only solution is to go to a place where they repair electronics and get your home button fixed. Either that or buy a new one, but fixing the button is probably cheaper. There's a place near where I live that fixes electronics in general. From phones to gaming systems, and maybe even TVs. But I'm not sure about that one. It's usually where I get my stuff fixed, try asking around for something like that in your town.

 only shows the apple image than goes off
