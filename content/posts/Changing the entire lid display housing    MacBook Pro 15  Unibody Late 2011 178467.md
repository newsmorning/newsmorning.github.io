## Chosen Solution
 I have a MacBook Pro 15" Unibody Late 2011 with a dent in the outer metal, and a corresponding spot on the display where the backlight is a little off.  I do have a few other MBP of the same model/year that have other issues, but their lid/display is fine.  Is it possible to somehow swap out the entire lid/screen/housing as a whole from one MBP to another?  I don't mean just swapping the screen.  Thanks.
