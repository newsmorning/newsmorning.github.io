## Chosen Solution
 When we plug it in the red light flashes we tried different methods on plugging it in different outlets and I try holding the power button for ten seconds then plugging it in same reaction to you

 Hey Essie Roberts check and see if the red light flashes a certain amount of times then a pause and back flashing that is a number i would Google check your make and model trouble code with red light  number. The other thing tells me you power board went out? Before this when you turn it on would it take a few minutes to come on. And if so it is the power board and i would just replace it.
