If you recently replaced the motherboard on your iPhone 6, you may have noticed that it no longer charges when connected to your PC. This is not an uncommon issue, but it can be frustrating nonetheless. In this article, we'll explore why this happens and what you can do to fix it.

## Why Does This Happen?

The reason your iPhone 6 may not charge on your PC after a motherboard replacement is due to the way that USB ports provide power. When an iPhone is connected to a PC, it uses the USB port to draw power to charge the battery. However, if the motherboard was replaced, the new motherboard may not be recognized by your PC as being an iPhone, which can cause charging issues. Additionally, if the new motherboard does not support USB power delivery, your iPhone may not charge at all.

## What Can You Do to Fix It?

There are a few things you can do to fix the issue of your iPhone 6 not charging on your PC after a motherboard replacement.

### 1. Use a Different Cable and/or USB Port

Sometimes the issue is as simple as a faulty cable or USB port. Try using a different cable or USB port to connect your iPhone 6 to your PC and see if that fixes the issue. If it does, then there may have been a problem with the original cable or port.

### 2. Update Your Drivers

If you're using Windows, you may need to update your drivers to ensure that your PC recognizes your iPhone. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Press the Windows key + X and select "Device Manager".
2. Expand the "Portable Devices" category.
3. Right-click on your iPhone and select "Update driver".
4. Select "Search automatically for updated driver software".
5. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### 3. Install Apple Mobile Device Support

If updating your drivers doesn't work, you may need to install Apple Mobile Device Support. This is a software that allows your PC to recognize and communicate with your iPhone. To install it, follow these steps:

1. Download the iTunes installer from the Apple website. 
2. Run the installer and select "Install" when prompted.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### 4. Use a Charging Dock

If you're still having issues charging your iPhone 6 on your PC after trying the above solutions, you can try using a charging dock. This is a device that plugs into an electrical outlet and allows you to charge your iPhone via a USB cable. This may be a more reliable way to charge your phone than using a USB port on your PC.

## Conclusion

Replacing the motherboard on your iPhone 6 can be a daunting task, and it's frustrating when you encounter issues afterwards. However, in most cases, there are simple solutions to the problem of your iPhone not charging on your PC. Whether it's using a different cable, updating your drivers, installing Apple Mobile Device Support, or using a charging dock, there are ways to ensure that your iPhone 6 stays charged and usable.
