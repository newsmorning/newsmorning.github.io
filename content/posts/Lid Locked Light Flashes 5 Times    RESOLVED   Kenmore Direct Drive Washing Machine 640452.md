## Chosen Solution
 I have a Kenmore Series 500 washer (I couldn’t find the option for the series 500 when I went to make my question so I clicked what looked closest to my machine) I’ve owned for about two years with little to practically no problems. Until today. I started a load on heavy duty which is what I mostly use for regular loads, and then during the sensing cycle I added a couple items I had missed. Again done this repeatedly in the past. This time however… while the lid was open the machine locked. I have unplugged it repeatedly for extended periods of time, held down the button to cancel it, but no matter what I do it will not unlock. Therefore I can’t close the lid because it’s locked and I can’t wash my clothes. I can’t even get the machine to drain and it has quite a bit of water in it along with my clothes. When I unplug it and plug it back in the lid lock light flashes 5 times and then it does nothing.
Update (02/02/2020)
My husband figured it out! Holding the cancel button wasn't working. He unplugged the machine and then held these two little spring-loaded things that are under the lock that the latch would push in on if the lid is closed. I plugged it back in as he was holding it and it unlocked itself!
So I think it had the error because the lock was on but it knew the lid wasn't down because the springs weren't pushed in.

 @jocelyn0425 start wit this and let us know more about your washer. Press and hold the “END OF CYCLE / CYCLE SIGNAL” button(s) for 20 seconds and this should clear the flashing light.
