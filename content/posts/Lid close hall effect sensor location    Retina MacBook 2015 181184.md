The Lid Close Hall Effect Sensor is a magnetometer that detects the magnetic field created by a magnet inside the laptop. It is a critical component that tells the laptop when the lid is open or closed, which is essential to the performance and safety of the device. However, this sensor is not located in an obvious place.

Typically, Lid Close Hall Effect Sensors are located in the hinge of the laptop's lid, where they can detect the magnetic field when the lid is closed. However, Apple has taken a unique approach with the Retina Macbook 2015. The Lid Close Hall Effect Sensor is hidden underneath the palm rest assembly, on the left side of the laptop. This location is unusual, and many users may never have noticed it.

The reason for Apple's decision to hide the Lid Close Hall Effect Sensor is unclear. However, it may have been a deliberate design choice to improve the laptop's aesthetics. By hiding the sensor, Apple was able to make the laptop look cleaner and more streamlined. This design choice is in line with Apple's philosophy of creating technology that is both functional and beautiful.

The Lid Close Hall Effect Sensor is a crucial component in the Retina Macbook 2015. Although its location is unconventional, it is a testament to Apple's commitment to design and innovation. By hiding the sensor, Apple was able to create a laptop that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

If you are a Retina Macbook 2015 user, it is essential to know the location of the Lid Close Hall Effect Sensor. It is hidden underneath the palm rest assembly, on the left side of the laptop. Knowing the location of this critical component will help you better understand your laptop and how it works.

In conclusion, Apple's decision to hide the Lid Close Hall Effect Sensor is a perfect example of how the company prioritizes design and innovation. It is another example of how Apple continues to push the boundaries of technology and create devices that are both beautiful and functional.

## Chosen Solution
 Does anyone know where the hall effect or lid close sensor is located on this model? I cannot seem to get a response from the sensor, hoping it's part of a replaceable part.
This is a 2015 15” MacBook Pro Retna

 I don’t have any picture but i’ve worked on this machine the sensor is under the keyboard and cannot be replaced on its own you’ll need to replace the keyboard if this part is faulty, the reason for this location is probably because the logic-board is in the middle of the chassis,
However if you want to further explain your issue I might be able to help.
