Infinix Mobility has taken the veil off its selfie-focused mid-range front-runner from the Hot-S series. The device, Infinix Hot S4, was launched in Nigeria some couple of weeks ago but this time, the Chinese smartphone company officially presented the device at an event in Kampala, Uganda under the #EmpowerTheInfinityYou campaign hashtag.
 
We previously gave some hints as to what to expect from the Infinix Hot S4 when it arrives but now that it’s here, check out the full features of the device, its price, and where to buy the Hot S4 in Uganda.
 
## Key Specification & Features 
 
Pick up the new Infinix Hot S4 and one thing you can’t help but notice is the smooth, glossy, and reflective front and back 2.5D Gorilla Glass covering. The covering and the available color variants (Milan Black, Sapphire Cyan, Gold) of the device surely adds some aesthetic spice to the device.
 
On the rear, Infinix embedded three sensors at the top-left corner of the Hot S4 and the below the triple-camera setup, a dual-tone Quad LED flash for capturing subjects in conditions of low-light. The square-shaped fingerprint sensor with curved edges is also on the rear of the device, typical of all Infinix smartphones from the series.
 
Flipping the device to the other side reveals a 6.26-inch HD+(720 x 1520 pixels) display in 19:9 aspect ratio. You’d also notice the slim bezels on the sides and the water-drop (or dew-drop) cutout at the top of the display. This waterdrop-esque notch houses the device’s 32MP selfie camera and makes the Infinix S4 the first smartphone from Infinix Mobility to sport this type of display notch.
 
The 32MP camera comes with interesting specs such as advanced AI-assisted Face Unlock, AI Cam, AI Beauty, and Bokeh (Portrait mode). The triple-camera setup is made up of a main 13MP sensor, a secondary 8MP ultra-wide angle sensor (up to 120°) and a third 2MP depth-of-field sensor.
 
On the inside, the Infinix S4 is just as exciting as its externals. The device is powered by MediaTek’s Helio P22 chipset with eight cores (Octa-core) and a maximum clock speed of 2.0 GHz. Users will also enjoy the latest features of the Android operating system as the device ships with Android 9.0 Pie out of the box. Additionally, the OS is based on Infinix’s newest custom XOS Cheetah 5.0.
 
Storage-wise, users can either purchase the base variant of the Infinix S4 with a storage combination of 3GB RAM and 32GB ROM or the higher variant with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage. Both variants support storage expansion of up to 256GB via micro SD card.
 
At 4,000mAh, the battery life should be able to supply a day’s usage, depending on the intensity of usage of course. The Hot S4 also supports Fast Charge but it’s quite disappointing that Infinix decided to use a Micro USB 2.0 port on this device rather than USB Type-C.
 
## Infinix Hot S4 Price and Where to Buy in Uganda
 
The Infinix Hot S4 has a recommended retail price of UGX 585,000 and according to Infinix, the device is available in all of its outlets across the country. To buy any variant of the device, you can check out any offline store that sells Infinix device near you. You can also check out online stores like Jumia Uganda or Kilimall.
