 - Update iCloud for Windows

 
### Fix Missing Media Features
 
You can’t install and run iCloud for Windows without the Windows Media Player. WMP is one of the programs already included in Windows 10, so you shouldn’t need to install that software unless you’ve removed it. However, Windows 10 KN and N versions don’t come with the WMP. You can add it to those platform versions by pressing the Download button on this page to save the Media Feature Pack to HDD. If you’re sure the Media Player is installed, check that it’s switched on as follows.
 
- Click the Cortana button and input ‘program’ in the search box to open the Programs and Features window shown below.

 
- Click Turn Windows features on or off to open the window directly below.

 
- Now click the + to expand Media Features, which includes a Windows Media Player check box.
 - Is the Windows Media Player checkbox selected? If not, select it and press OK to close the window.
 - Restart the OS and add iCloud to Windows.
 - If Windows Media Player is selected, you can reinstall it by deselecting its checkbox and restarting Windows. Then select the Windows Media Player check box again to switch it back on.

 
### Enable iCloud Photos on Windows 10
 
- Are you getting an “iCloud Photos is not enabled” error even though you’re signed in to iCloud for Windows? If so, you can fix that by selecting the My Photo Stream option in iCloud as follows.
 - First, open the iCloud for Windows software.
 - Click the Open iCloud text and then select the Photos checkbox.

 
- Press the Options button for Photos to open further settings.
 - Select the My Photo Stream option.
 - You can also press the Change button to choose an alternative default photos location in Windows.
 - Click OK > Apply to confirm selected settings.

 
### Fix iCloud Photo Stream not Synching
 
- If your iCloud software is set up to download the photos but still not downloading photo streams, open the Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar and selecting Task Manager.

 
- Select the Processes tab and then search for Apple Photostreams Uploader and Apple Photostreams Downloader processes listed there.
 - Select the Apple Photostreams Uploader and Apple Photostreams processes and press their End task buttons to close them.
 - Open Run by pressing the Win key + R hotkey, input ‘%appdata%’ and press the Enter key.
 - Click Apple Computer and open the Media Center directory in File Explorer, and delete everything in the Media Center folder.
 - Reboot or Log out and back into Windows 10.
 - Now open the iCloud control panel again, and double-check the Photos options to ensure they’re configured correctly.

 
### Update iCloud for Windows
 
Updating iCloud can also fix numerous issues. The updated version is iCloud for Windows v 5.1, which is also compatible with Outlook 2016 so that it works with that software. If you don’t currently have the latest iCloud version, update it with Apple Software Update.
