Find Out Now with This Surprising Default Password Hack!\nIf you own a Linksys EA4500 N900 router, you might think that your home network is secure. After all, you have set up a strong password to keep unwanted guests out, right? Unfortunately, that might not be enough to keep your router safe from attackers.\nAccording to a recent report, a surprising default password hack could compromise the security of your Linksys EA4500 N900 router. This vulnerability is not a new one, but many people are still unaware of it. Here is what you need to know.\nThe Default Password Hack\nThe default password hack of the Linksys EA4500 N900 router is a method of access that is still available in some older models. Believe it or not, some Linksys routers still use the default login credentials, which are “admin” for the username and “admin” for the password. This means that, with these easy-to-guess credentials, anyone can log in to your router and gain control over your home network.\nWhy is this a problem? Well, if an attacker gains access to your router, they can do all sorts of things. They can steal your personal information, launch a cyber attack on your devices, or even use your network to spread malware to others. Worst of all, you might not even know that your router has been compromised until it’s too late.\nHow to Protect Yourself\nSo, what can you do to protect yourself from the default password hack of the Linksys EA4500 N900 router? Here are a few tips:\nChange the default password: The first and most obvious step is to change the default login credentials of your router. Log in to your router’s web interface and navigate to the settings section. From there, you can change the admin username and password to something more secure. Use a strong password that’s hard to guess and that you haven’t used before.\nUpdate your firmware: Make sure that your router’s firmware is up to date. The latest firmware patches vulnerabilities and adds new features. Check the Linksys website for the latest firmware update for your router.\nDisable remote management: Remote management allows you to access your router’s settings from anywhere, which is convenient but also risky. If you don’t need remote management, disable it. This way, an attacker won’t be able to log in to your router from a remote location.\nEnable Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA2): WPA2 is the strongest encryption standard available for Wi-Fi networks. Make sure that your router is using WPA2 encryption for your Wi-Fi network.\nUse a guest network: Set up a guest network to separate your guests from your devices. This way, an attacker won’t be able to compromise your devices through your unsecured guest network.\nConclusion\nThe default password hack of the Linksys EA4500 N900 router is a serious vulnerability that could compromise the security of your home network. The good news is that it’s easy to protect yourself by changing the default login credentials, updating your firmware, disabling remote management, using WPA2 encryption, and setting up a guest network. Don’t wait until it’s too late to secure your router - take action now!\nThe Linksys EA4500 router ships with a default username, password, and IP address. To access the router, open a web browser, go to the address bar and enter 192.168.1.1, which is the IP address common to most routers.\nThen enter admin as the default username and admin as the default password (the password is case-sensitive).\nIf the EA4500 Default Password Doesn’t Work A default password fails because someone changed it. Changing a password to something more secure (especially when it’s really simple, such as admin) is important for the security of your network.\nThis device’s model number is EA4500, but it’s often marketed as the Linksys N900 router. Also, even though it’s available in two hardware versions (1.0 and 3.0), both use the same default information above.\nIf the default Linksys EA4500 password doesn’t work, reset the router to its factory defaults:\nPower on the router, then turn it around so you have access to the back, where the cables plug in. Use a small and sharp object such as a paperclip, to press and hold the Reset button for about 15 seconds, until the power light flashes. Unplug the power cable for a few seconds, then plug it back in. Wait 30 seconds or so for the router to boot back up. Log in to the Router Now that the N900 router is reset, log in to the router from a web browser:\nPower on the router, then turn it around so you have access to the back, where the cables plug in.\nUse a small and sharp object such as a paperclip, to press and hold the Reset button for about 15 seconds, until the power light flashes.\nUnplug the power cable for a few seconds, then plug it back in.\nWait 30 seconds or so for the router to boot back up.\nGo to the address bar and enter http://192.168.1.1. The router and the device you use to access the router must be on the same network. If the device is a phone or tablet, connect to Wi-Fi. Enter the N900 default router information (admin for both username and password). Change the default password to something other than admin. This step isn’t necessary, but it may as well be. You can store the new username and password in a password manager to avoid ever forgetting it. After the router is reset, any customizations you made are deleted. This includes the wireless network password, SSID (service set identifier), and DNS (domain name system) server settings. Re-enter that information to get the router back to how it was before the reset.\nGo to the address bar and enter http://192.168.1.1.\nThe router and the device you use to access the router must be on the same network. If the device is a phone or tablet, connect to Wi-Fi.\nEnter the N900 default router information (admin for both username and password).\nChange the default password to something other than admin. This step isn’t necessary, but it may as well be. You can store the new username and password in a password manager to avoid ever forgetting it.\nWhat to Do When You Can’t Access the EA4500 Router If you can’t get to the EA4500 router through the 192.168.1.1 IP address, it likely was changed to something else after it was first set up.\nTo avoid losing the configuration information in case the router is reset in the future, back up the configuration to a file. Use this file to restore the router settings. Page 55 of the user manual (linked below) shows how.\nThe router doesn’t need to be reset to get the IP address. But, if you did already reset it, the default address should work, unless you’ve misread the model number—see this Linksys Default Password List to confirm the IP address for your specific router model.\nRegardless, you can find out the default gateway that a computer connected to the router is using. This will be the IP address you use in the steps above to log in to the router.\nLinksys EA4500 Firmware and Manual Links When downloading the firmware for the EA4500, download the right one for the hardware version of your router. The download page has sections for versions 1.0 and 3.0. Each section contains a separate link to the firmware. If you’re in the United States, read the Important note on the download page.\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1272","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Martin Zaczek"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/linksys-ea4500-n900-default-password1459268/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your Linksys EA4500 N900 Router at Risk?
