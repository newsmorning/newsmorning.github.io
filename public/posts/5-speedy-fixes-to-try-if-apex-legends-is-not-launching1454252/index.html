Try these 5 speedy fixes and dominate the game! Are you tired of your Apex Legends game not launching? It can be frustrating to spend hours trying to get the game to work, only to have it crash or freeze on you.

To update your graphics card drivers, visit the website of your graphics card manufacturer and download the latest drivers for your card. Once you have downloaded and installed the new drivers, restart your computer and try launching Apex Legends again.\nFix 3: Verify Your Game Files Sometimes, game files can become corrupted or missing, which can prevent Apex Legends from launching.

Try disabling your anti-virus software temporarily and see if the game launches. If it does, you can add Apex Legends to your anti-virus software’s exceptions list to prevent it from being flagged as a threat in the future.\nFix 5: Run the Game as Administrator Sometimes, running Apex Legends as an administrator can help with launching issues. To do this, right click on the game icon and select “run as administrator.” This will give the game access to administrative privileges that may be necessary for it to launch.\nWith these 5 quick and easy fixes, you should be able to get your Apex Legends game up and running again.
