It can happen to anyone - accidentally spilling a drink on your laptop. And unfortunately, for one MacBook Pro user, this mistake had some serious consequences. 

The laptop was a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019) and it had just received a full upgrade to keep it running smoothly. But after a careless spillage of coffee on the keyboard, the owner noticed that the laptop wouldn't boot up properly anymore. That's when they knew some serious damage had been done. 

The owner tried turning the laptop on several times but all they got was a black screen. They also noticed that the function keys were stuck and not working properly, leaving them unable to use some of their most important programs.

Frustrated and unsure of what to do, the owner took their laptop to an Apple service center to have it checked out. The technician immediately diagnosed the problem - the liquid had seeped into the laptop and damaged some of the components irreversibly. 

After confirming that the motherboard was damaged beyond repair, the technician advised the owner to replace the whole motherboard. This would have been an incredibly expensive option that was not feasible for the owner. Instead, they decided to try a less expensive option - replacing only the keyboard and the trackpad.

The replacement was successful and it helped the laptop boot up, but there was a major problem that remained. The function keys still weren't working properly, leaving the owner unable to use certain programs. 

It was then that the owner discovered that there was no mechanical connection between the function keys and the motherboard. The function keys were instead controlled by a circuit board that was located underneath the keyboard. This circuit board was also damaged by the liquid spillage and needed to be replaced.

The owner contacted the technician once again and explained the situation. The technician suggested replacing the entire upper case - including the keyboard, trackpad, and the circuit board. This was another expensive option, but the owner decided to go for it nevertheless.

After the replacement of the upper case, the MacBook Pro was finally back to functioning properly. But the whole experience was a costly one - both in terms of time and money. 

The lesson from this experience is clear - be careful with your laptops and avoid spilling liquids on them at all costs. And if the worst happens, don't panic - there are solutions available, but they may come at a high cost.

## Chosen Solution
 I spilled very little tea (without sugar) near the power button. I immediately powered down the computer. It worked perfectly during this 5-10 second process.
I then put the Mac facedown, opened it, disconnected the battery (and the little thin and long ribbon cable over it, which I'd like to know what is for). I noticed that the logic board was not affected by the liquid (both face up or face down). No sign of liquid corrosion even one week later. There was some tea on the fan and underneath it, which I dried asap.
I waited three days before trying to see if the Mac was working again.
It doesn't start up. When I connect the power, with both the battery and the ribbon cable over it connected, the fan remains still. When I disconnect the battery and the ribbon cable, the fan starts moving and the logic board gets hot, but the screen remains black.
I thought that the keyboard was  the only damaged part, but if it were so, booting should be possible by connecting it to outside power, right?

 Take your Macbooks motherboard out and first of all rinse it in distilled water to remove any of the tea residue. Then dry it asap with a towel or something. After that clean the board with isopropyl alcohol and a toothbrush to help remove any corrosion visible or not. After that let it dry for 2-3 mins and put it back together. With any luck it will be good to go.
