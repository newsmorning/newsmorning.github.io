It’s so easy that you won’t believe it!\nStep 1: Compress the photos\nThe first step is to compress the photos you want to send. iPhone photos can be quite large, and this can cause problems when you try to send them. To compress your photos, follow these steps:\nOpen the Photos app on your iPhone. Tap the photo you want to compress. Tap the share button in the bottom left corner of the screen. Choose the “Mail” option. In the mail composer, you will see the compressed version of your photo. This step will ensure that your photo is in a smaller size, making it easier to send.\nStep 2: Use AirDrop\nNow that you have compressed the photo, the next step is to use AirDrop to send it. AirDrop is a feature built into iOS that enables you to share files between Apple devices. Here’s how you can use AirDrop to send your compressed photo:\nOpen the Photos app on your iPhone. Select the compressed photo you want to send. Tap the share button in the bottom left corner of the screen. Tap the AirDrop icon at the top of the share sheet. Choose the device you want to share the photo with. That’s it! Using AirDrop, you can quickly and easily send your photos to other Apple devices. The recipient doesn’t even need to have their Bluetooth or Wi-Fi turned on to receive it.\nConclusion\nIn this tutorial, we showed you how to solve the iPhone photo sending problem with just two simple steps. Compressing your photos and using AirDrop to share them can save you time and frustration when trying to send photos from your iPhone.\nThis hack is so easy and efficient that you won’t believe it! So, go ahead and give it a try the next time you need to send a photo from your iPhone.

Restart iPhone Go to Settings \u003e General \u003e scroll down and tap on Shut Down.

Make Sure MMS is Turned On If you are unable to send Photos to an Android Device user, the problem could be due to MMS Messaging feature not being enabled on your iPhone.\nGo to Settings \u003e Messages and move the toggle next to MMS Messaging to ON position.\nThis will ensure that your iPhone is able to send Photos to both Apple device users (iMessages) and Android Device users (SMS/MMS Messages).\n5.

You can easily rule out this possibility by going to Apple’s System Status page.\nOn this page, Apple provides a list of all its services and their current status of service (Available or Unavailable).\n6. Disable WiFi Assist The WiFi Assist feature on iPhone can sometimes create problems due to its tendency to automatically switch from Cellular to available WiFi Networks.\nGo to Settings \u003e Cellular and move the toggle next to WiFi Assist to OFF position.\nNow, check to see if your iPhone is still having problems while sending photos.\n7. Install Carrier Updates Sometimes, the problem is due to Carrier updates not being installed on your device.\nGo to Settings \u003e General \u003e About \u003eNetwork.\nOn the next screen, tap on the Update option to install Carrier updates (if available).\n8. Reset Network Settings Note down your WiFi Network Password and follow the steps below to Reset Network Setting on your iPhone.\nGo to Settings \u003e General \u003e Transfer or Reset iPhone \u003e Reset \u003e On the pop-up, select Reset Network Settings option.\nIf prompted, enter your Lock Screen Password.
