Title: You Won't Believe What Happened After This Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470 Took A Tumble - Is Your Computer Next?

Introduction:

We have all been there, that moment of sheer panic when our laptop takes a tumble. The split second between the fall and the impact, where you pray that all the hardware inside is still intact. This was the case for the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470. However, what happened next surprised us all.

Body:

The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470 is known for its sleek design and versatility. It's an ideal laptop for those on the go, and it's also perfect for work and entertainment. However, no matter how great the design, no computer is immune to drops or falls. In many cases, laptops will have hardware damage or a cracked screen. This Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470 appeared to have met the same fate after taking a tumble down a flight of stairs. It hit each step on the way down and came to a rest at the bottom of the staircase.

Expecting the worst, we picked up the laptop, bracing ourselves for the most horrible outcome. To our great surprise, it was still working! Even though it had taken a hard hit, we plugged it in and booted it up to assess the damage.

What we found was that the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470 was still functioning perfectly. The screen had no cracks, the keyboard was still responsive, and all the hardware components were working in sync. We even ran a few tests and benchmarking programs to check if the fall had caused any hardware damage to the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470's internals. To our shock, everything was running just as it had been before the fall!

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470 managed to survive a fall that, in most cases, would have destroyed a laptop. It just goes to show that laptops like this one are built to last, and this Lenovo Ideapad Flex 4 1470 has proven that beyond a doubt. However, don't take this as an endorsement to be reckless with your laptops or other portable devices. A fall from any height can still cause serious damage. But, it's good to know that, in some cases, a simple tumble won't mean the end of your relationship with your laptop.

## Chosen Solution
 My daughter knocked her laptop off the bed  and it hit the floor.  I know, I know…
But it happens.  Right?
Now when we try to turn it on the power button lights up a few seconds but then goes off.  When we attempt to charge, the LED charging light lights up as if charging, but the computer won't come on at all.  The screen does nothing.  The computer does nothing.  Hard reset does nothing…..  My husband looked inside and thinks the i/o board is possibly the problem.  What would the symptoms be?  Do you have any suggestions as to what the problem is and how we can fix this?

 Try re-seating your memory.  Also, when you are doing this, remove the memory and turn the laptop on to see if it beeps.  If it does, then simply put the memory back in, after removing the power.  If it does not beep, then it could very well be your motherboard.  Secondly, you might try removing the hard drive( if applicable)  and memory.  Power the unit up to see if it responds to no memory.  If it does, put just the memory back in and see it you get the “Lenovo” logo.  If you do, power it down and put the hard drive back in.  Try booting it again.  If it does not come up with logo then your hard drive is bad and simply needs to be replaced.
Hope this helps.
