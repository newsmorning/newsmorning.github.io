# WARNING: Is Your MacBook Pro 13 In Danger? Find Out Why the A1708 Battery Control Board Cable Damage Could Be A Silent Killer!

If you own a MacBook Pro 13, you may already be aware of its susceptibility to keyboard issues, display problems, or slow performance. But what you may not know is that a lesser-known issue with the A1708 battery control board cable could be silently killing your device.

The MacBook Pro 13 with A1708 model number was released in 2016 and is still being sold. This model is known for its slim design and powerful performance, but it has also been plagued with various issues, including the battery control board cable problem.

The A1708 battery control board cable connects the battery to the logic board of the MacBook Pro 13. It is responsible for managing the charging, discharging, and overall performance of the battery. Over time, this cable can become damaged due to wear and tear or mishandling, leading to serious consequences.

The most common symptom of a damaged A1708 battery control board cable is a dead or failing battery. You may notice that your MacBook Pro 13 loses charge very quickly, is unable to hold a charge, or does not turn on at all. This can be a frustrating and expensive problem to fix, especially if you have to replace the entire battery or logic board.

But the damage caused by the A1708 battery control board cable doesn't stop there. If left unchecked, it can also affect other components of your MacBook Pro 13, including the trackpad, keyboard, and display. These components rely on a steady power supply, which the damaged cable cannot provide, leading to malfunction or failure.

So, how can you prevent your MacBook Pro 13 from falling victim to the A1708 battery control board cable problem? The first step is to be aware of the issue and to take care when handling your device. Avoid pulling or twisting the cable, and be sure to store your laptop in a protective case or sleeve.

If you notice any signs of a failing battery, such as those described above, take your MacBook Pro 13 to an authorized Apple service provider immediately. They will be able to diagnose the problem and replace the cable if necessary. It's essential to act promptly, as the longer you wait, the more likely it is that other components will become affected.

In conclusion, the A1708 battery control board cable problem may be a lesser-known issue with the MacBook Pro 13, but it can have serious consequences for the longevity and performance of your device. By taking care when handling your laptop and being vigilant for signs of a failing battery, you can prevent this silent killer from striking.

## Chosen Solution
 I was installing a replacement battery in my Apple MacBook Pro Retina 2016 with function keys, and after the install I noticed  the tiny cable on the battery from the battery control board to the top of the battery has ripped.
I’ve circled the cable in the image below.
Does anyone know what the purpose of this cable is? Is it dangerous to keep using the device with this ribbon ripped?
The device appears to be working fine, turns on when using battery, appears to charge fine, however I’m concerned this cable has been torn off.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 Thats the battery sensor cable, your battery has a bunch of sensors to monitor temp and voltage inputing into the micro controller on the main board of the battery to control the charging and this information is also forwarded to SMC logic inside your systems logic board.
Sadly its time for a new battery if the wires are damaged within it.
