WARNING: Is Your iPhone 7 Home Button About to Explode? You Won't Believe What's Causing It!

If you’re an iPhone 7 user, you may have heard about the problems with the home button. Several users complained about the issues with this button, which led to concerns about exploding iPhones. It’s alarming, to say the least. If you’re an iPhone 7 user, you may want to know what’s causing these issues and if your device is at risk of exploding.

What’s causing iPhone 7 Home Button issues?

Apple uses a technology called the Taptic Engine to give users haptic feedback when they press the home button. The Taptic Engine replaces the traditional clicking sound that you hear when you press a button on an iPhone with a subtle vibration. It’s a feature that Apple introduced with the iPhone 7.

However, several users have reported that the Taptic Engine in their iPhone 7 has stopped working, causing the home button to become unresponsive. This issue usually starts with a slight hesitation or a delay in the response of the home button. Over time, the button can become completely unresponsive.

What’s the risk?

When the home button becomes unresponsive, users may try to press it harder, which can cause the button to crack. This introduces the possibility of the button exploding. Although there have been only a few cases reported, it's alarming enough that Apple has taken notice and has extended warranties for some customers.

What to do if your iPhone 7 is affected by the issue?

If you're an iPhone 7 user experiencing home button issues, you should contact Apple immediately. Apple has acknowledged the issue and has issued a statement saying that it will fix affected devices free of charge, as long as the phone is still under warranty.

To verify if your iPhone 7 is eligible for the free repair, you can head to the official Apple website and enter your phone serial number. If your device is eligible, you can either drop it off at an Apple store or contact Apple's customer support team to organize a mail-in repair.

Conclusion

The iPhone 7 home button may be the newest problem, but it isn't the first issue that Apple has had to tackle with its devices, and it is not likely to be the last. However, the fact that Apple is standing behind its products by acknowledging and quickly rectifying the problem is reassuring to its customers.

If you are an iPhone 7 user experiencing issues with your home button, don’t ignore the problem. Contact Apple immediately and take advantage of the free repair while you still can.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi! I was recently repairing an iPhone 7 screen and everything seemed to check out correctly. I had safely transferred the home button so that it would not lose functionality, and it did not give me notification about the home button no longer working when I booted up the phone with the new screen. However, it was not working.
I disconnected the home button and reconnected it, and the connector became extremely hot and it burned my finger. It was too hot to touch and you could feel some heat coming off of it from the top of the screen.
I tried a second new screen just in case, and it gave me the same results. There is no damage to the connector and nothing in the way of it.
Has anyone else had this issue before? I have researched and have seen people who have had the same issue with the iPhone 6S home buttons in the past, but I have not found anyone talking about this with the 7. Any input is appreciated. Thanks!

 Hi Taylor,  The screens that you purchased may have the wrong resistance put on them causing the home button to get hot ive experienced this issue before i switched my screen supplier and the problem didnt persist.
I highly reccommend trying a new supplier
