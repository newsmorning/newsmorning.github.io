# Are you tired of constant display flicker on your Macbook Pro? Here's the quick fix you need - change your Wifi card!

Are you a Macbook Pro user who's been troubled by constant display flicker? Does your laptop's screen flicker even after rebooting, updating the operating system or adjusting screen settings? If yes, you're not alone! Many Macbook Pro users have encountered this problem and been left feeling frustrated and helpless.

However, did you know there's a quick and easy fix that can cure the display flicker issue on your Macbook Pro? And, that solution is none other than changing your Wifi card! Now, you may wonder how a Wifi card could be connected to display flicker. Here's everything you need to know.

## The connection between display flicker and Wifi cards

The screen display flicker issue is believed to be experienced by Macbook Pro users with the Broadcom BCM43xx wifi chipset. This is because the old chipset interferes with the laptop's screen display cable. This interference leads to a weakening of the cable, hence causing the screen to flicker. So, when you replace the old Broadcom BCM43xx chipset with a newer one, the interference stops and the display flicker issue disappears!

## Steps to change your Wifi card

Are you convinced that changing your Wifi card can be the solution to your display flicker issue? Great! Now, here's a step-by-step guide on how to change your Wifi card.

### Step 1: Get the right Wifi card

Firstly, you need to purchase the right Wifi card for your Macbook Pro. The ideal Wifi card for Macbook Pro is the Apple Broadcom BCM94360CD - 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with Bluetooth 4.0. This card comes with built-in drivers that automatically work with macOS.

### Step 2: Power off and remove the battery

Before you start changing the Wifi card, power off your Macbook Pro and remove the battery.

### Step 3: Remove the back panel

Next, remove the back panel of your Macbook Pro. You can do this by unscrewing the 10 screws that hold the back panel in place.

### Step 4: Disconnect the old Wifi card

Disconnect the old Wifi card by unscrewing the 2 screws that hold it in place and then gently pulling it out.

### Step 5: Install the new Wifi card

Install the new Wifi card by inserting it into the slot and then screwing it into place using the 2 screws that you removed earlier.

### Step 6: Replace the back panel and battery

Finally, replace the back panel and battery, and then power on your Macbook Pro. Voila! Your Macbook Pro's display should no longer flicker.

## In conclusion

If you're one of the many Macbook Pro users struggling with constant display flicker, changing your Wifi card might just be the quick fix you need! It's a straightforward process that can save you a lot of time, energy and money that might have gone towards purchasing a new laptop.

## Chosen Solution
 I purchased my macbook shortly after release.  I noticed it flickered from time to time, however it wasn’t known back then that it was caused by interference of the wifi card so it never was resolved when I took it into repair and once it was known, it was out of warranty.  However, I have heard that by switching out my wifi card with the card from the 2013 model could fix this problem.  Has anyone tried this with any success?

 There is a bit of added shielding within the case & lid, the AirPort board in its self won’t alter things.
Sadly your procrastination may have killed off the free repair. I would still visit an Apple Store to see if they will still fix it under the extended warranty program it was serviced under.
