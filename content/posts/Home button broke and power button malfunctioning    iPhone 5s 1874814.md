## Chosen Solution
 I have a 5s. It used to be my moms, and she gave it to me a while ago (like a year and a half) in great condition. However, in the past months I've had some issues. First: the home button stopped always working, it would only work sometimes (now it has escalated to the point that it never works). Second: in the past 3 days I've noticed that my power button doesn't work when I'm turning it on. After spamming the power button and home button a bit, my phone will turn on but I'm not sure why this is happening.
Any way as to how I can fix the issue with the power button? Because it definitely works, just seems to malfunction when the phone is off.

 Your power button issue is common in the 5/5c/5s phones.  There is a little dimple on the power flex that gets compressed when you touch the button.  This dimple gets worn out over time, so you need to replace the power button flex cable.  It's a little tedious, but not too hard.  The part is around 5 bucks.
Your home button issue is similar.  I have seen home buttons wear out as well.  Do you have the touch id on?  If so, does your touch id always work or is it random too?  You can replace the home button for around 5 bucks as well, but youll lose touch id function as that is tied to the original home button on the 5s.
