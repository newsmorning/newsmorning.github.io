If you're a puzzle lover, then you're sure to relish the mind-bending challenges in Little Nightmares 2. This critically acclaimed game offers a series of intricate puzzles, but there's one that stands out from the rest- the epic chess puzzle.

The intriguing chess puzzle in Little Nightmares 2 is one of the most challenging and satisfying puzzles in the game. To solve it, you must help the main character, Mono, reach the other side of the board by moving chess pieces strategically. It requires careful planning and quick thinking, making it an excellent exercise for your mind.

If you're struggling to solve this puzzle or want to learn some helpful tips and tricks, don't worry, we've got you covered. Our ultimate guide will walk you through the steps to solve this cunning conundrum.

Step 1: Understanding the Chess Piece Movements 

Before you begin, let's review and understand how each piece can move. The pawns only advance ahead one square at a time. The knight moves in an L shape, while the bishop moves diagonally. The rook moves horizontally or vertically, and the queen can move diagonally, vertically, and horizontally. Finally, the king moves as a queen in a fixed location in the central of the board.

Step 2: Start with the Right Pieces 

Your first move will depend on what pieces are available to you. Before beginning, you should try to position your pieces strategically, so they're in the right order to provide cover for each other. We recommend starting the game with the pawns, then moving on to the knight, bishop, and rook. 

Step 3: Identify the Key Pieces 

To solve this puzzle, you must identify the most critical pieces that you need to use first. Ideally, you should use your knight to cover the pawn's moves to prevent the opponent from making a successful attack. You may also need to use your bishop to selectively cutoff your opponent's movement patterns.

Step 4: Keep an Eye on Your Opponent's Movements 

To outsmart your opponent, you need to anticipate their moves. You can do this by looking at their moves and seeing which pieces they will be investing. In most cases, you should try to block their advance, so they can’t move the pieces to take on your protected pieces.

Step 5: Don't Be Predictable 

It's essential to stay one step ahead of your opponent; you don't want to make moves that are predictable. For instance, you may want to perform moves that lead to check, forcing your opponent to move their king, creating more opportunities for you to win.

Step 6: Be Patient 

The key to solving any chess puzzle is patience. It's easy to get frustrated, but keep in mind that you may have to restart the puzzle several times before you come up with the winning strategy. Sometimes, your best move is to sit back and think carefully about your next move.

In conclusion, the epic chess puzzle in Little Nightmares 2 is an excellent mental exercise that challenges your decision-making skills and strategic thinking. With our ultimate guide, you'll be able to develop a winning strategy and unleash your inner genius to solve this puzzle. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right the first time, practice and patience will lead to success. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try!
