Executable files are programs or software that can run on your computer. These files are often a gateway for attackers who want to gain access to your sensitive data or damage your system. Therefore, it is essential to know about the different executable file extensions and how to protect your computer from malicious attacks.\nExecutable File Extensions:\nBelow are some common executable file extensions that you may come across while using your computer.\n.exe (Executable File): .EXE stands for “executable,” meaning this file can run on your computer. They’re often used to start new software installations, run applications, or perform system diagnostics.\n.dll (Dynamic Link Library): A DLL file is a kind of file that contains instructions for how Windows programs can access hardware devices and other software.\n.jar (Java Archive): Java Archive files contain executable Java code, usually in the form of a utility program, an applet, or a Java-based game.\n.com (Command File): A command file usually contains instructions that must be followed from the command prompt or in a batch file. Using command files can make it easier to automate tasks on your computer.\n.bat (Batch File): A batch file is a set of commands stored in plain text that computers can execute. They’re often used to automate repetitive tasks or run complex scripts.\nHow to Protect Your Computer from Malicious Executable Files?\nHere are some useful tips to protect your computer from malicious executable files.\nKeep your operating system and other applications up-to-date with the latest security updates and patches.\nInstall and regularly update your anti-virus software. This software will help detect and remove viruses and malware on your system.\nAvoid downloading files from suspicious or unverified sources.\nBe careful when opening email attachments, especially if the email is from an unknown sender. Always verify the sender’s identity and be cautious if the email has any urgent or suspicious subject line.\nUse strong and unique passwords for your computer and online accounts.\nConclusion:\nIn today’s digital world, keeping your computer secure is essential. By understanding the different executable file extensions and following the tips mentioned in this article, you can protect your computer from potential threats. Staying cautious and vigilant while using your computer will help you mitigate any potential risks and keep your system safe.\nA file with an executable file extension means that the file format supports some ability to run an automatic task. This is in contrast to other file formats that just display data, play a sound or video, or otherwise present content without running a system command.\nFile Extensions Explained If you open a file with one of these file extensions, your computer could, without your continued permission, run one or more operations programmed into that file.\nTo put it in even simpler terms, these files either belong to programs, scripts, or program extensions and plugins. They’re meant to run and do things on your computer, only you can’t be sure exactly what they’re running or doing. That’s why it’s always crucial to only run them when they come from a trusted source or website.\nThose operations could be damaging if, for example, you were to run a virus-infected executable file that you received by email from someone you don’t know.\nHigh-Risk File Extensions We’ve rated the following executable file types as High Risk because essentially all computers with the listed operating system installed, execute the commands contained in the executable file.\nPlease exercise caution before opening these kinds of files, especially those received in suspicious emails or downloaded from unfamiliar websites. Use an online virus scanner on the specific file you’re concerned about if you’re not sure if it’s safe (remember, though, that not all dangerous files are necessarily malicious, so those scanners shouldn’t be your only line of defense).\nIn other words, files with the extensions listed below can be executed with some basic parts of Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. No additional program is required.\n[1] To execute an INF file, you must open the pop-up menu (usually by right-clicking on the file) and choose Install.\nOther Executable File Extensions The following file extensions are only executable if you happen to have the software installed that carries out the commands contained in the file.\nIf you do have one of the programs below installed, consider files with the associated extensions as executable and High Risk. If you don’t have a particular program installed, and you try to execute a file with that extension, either a harmless error will appear or nothing at all will happen.\n[1] “Original Scripting Engine” refers to whatever program created the script. It would be impossible to list, and keep updated, the number of scripting engines that might use these file extensions.\nThis is not a complete list of executable file extensions, nor is it a list of dangerous but non-executable file types. Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\nHow to Open, Edit, and Convert CSH Files\nWhat Is an EX_ File?\nWhat Is an AHK File?\nWhat Is an XLSB File?\nWhat Is an XP3 File?\nHow to Open and Convert AVC Files\nWhat Is a File Extension?\nThe 9 Best Free Antivirus Software of 2023\nWhat Is an XLM File?\nWhat Is an XPI File?\nWhat Is an ARD File?\n8 Best Free Download Managers\nWhat Is an IDX File?\nWhat Is a Script Error?\nWhat Is an MSR File?\n12 Best Free Spyware Removal Tools (January 2023)\nFacebook\nTwitter\nHit Refresh on Your Tech News\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nEditorial Guidelines\nTerms of Use\nCareers\nAdvertise\nContact\nEU Privacy\nNEWS\nHOW TO\nFEATURES\nABOUT US\n","wordCount":"965","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bryan Craig"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/list-of-executable-file-extensions1365807/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Are You Protecting Your Computer?
