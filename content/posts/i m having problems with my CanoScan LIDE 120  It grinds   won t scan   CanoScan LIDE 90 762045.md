## Chosen Solution
 My CanoScan LIDE 120 sometimes scans and sometimes makes a grinding noise and doesn’t scan. It just started acting up recently and I can’t get any help from Cannon because it’s no longer under warranty. When I unplug and plug it back in, it works for a bit and then doesn’t. Ideas?

 Hi @captainvideo ,

I realize that it isn’t the same model but it may help as it should help you to open the device and to inspect the track that the scanner travels along to see what is happening.
Hopefully a start
