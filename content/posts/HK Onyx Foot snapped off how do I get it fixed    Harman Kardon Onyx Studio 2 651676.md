# Shocking News: Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 Foot Snaps Off! Discover the Ultimate Fix!

If you own a Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2, chances are you are familiar with its powerful sound and sleek design. However, it has come to our attention that some users have experienced the unfortunate event of a foot snapping off. This can be alarming and frustrating, especially if the device is no longer under warranty. But fear not, because we have discovered the ultimate fix for this issue.

## Understanding the Problem

First, let's take a closer look at the problem. The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 is designed with four feet that serve as a base to keep the device stable on any surface. However, due to poor craftsmanship or the misuse of force, these feet can snap off, leaving the device wobbly and unstable. This can not only affect the quality of the sound but also potentially damage the device.

## Troubleshooting the Damage

If you have experienced this issue, the first thing to do is to assess the damage. Depending on the severity, the foot may be completely detached or partially broken. If it is partially broken, you may be able to use a strong adhesive such as super glue to reattach the foot. However, if it is completely broken off, you will need to take a different approach.

## The Ultimate Fix

Here is the ultimate fix: using simple materials, you can make a replacement foot that is both durable and stable. All you need is a small plastic cup, a sponge, and a hot glue gun.

1. Cut a small piece of sponge to the size of the bottom of the cup.
2. Apply hot glue to the bottom of the cup and attach the sponge.
3. Once the glue has hardened, turn the cup upside down and place it on the surface where the original foot was snapped off.
4. Secure the cup in place by applying hot glue around the base of the cup.
5. Allow the glue to fully dry and harden.

You now have a sturdy replacement foot that will keep your Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 stable and working properly.

## Conclusion

While a snapped-off foot on your Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 may seem like a major problem, it is not an issue that cannot be fixed. By following these simple steps, you can create a new, sturdy foot that will keep your device stable and long-lasting. So, the next time you encounter this problem, don't panic. Just apply this ultimate fix and get back to enjoying your music the way it's meant to be heard.

## Chosen Solution
 The foot on my Speaker snapped off any way to get it fixed.  Super Glue not working!

 The handyman's scret weapon: duct tape... jk :call Harman Kardon; they will either send you a replacement or a upgrade

 Use krazy glue.  Clean the area of the broken leg. And apply the glue on the surface of the middle piece of the leg and the piece of the speaker. Hold a min in place.  And let dry . for the best result. let the speaker  dry for 24hrs.

 I used a 2-part epoxy. Holding well.
