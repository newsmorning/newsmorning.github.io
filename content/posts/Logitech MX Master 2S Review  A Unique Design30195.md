We purchased the Logitech MX Master 2S so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

The Logitech MX Master 2S is a fantastic mouse that boasts an ergonomic design without sacrificing its aesthetic quality. Its unique design gives it great comfort, while a solid build maintains the premium feel. Being able to switch between three devices is a nice feature and the rechargeable battery inside means no more dealing with AA batteries. Plus, you shouldn’t have to recharge it often with its ridiculous battery life. 

 
##   Design: Ergonomic and sturdy   
 

The MX Master 2S has a typical layout with left and right buttons, and a scroll wheel sandwiched between. Additionally, Logitech has included a square button behind the top scroll wheel as well as two forward and backward buttons on the thumb-side of the mouse with a thumb wheel for side-to-side scrolling. 

 

The model we tested was graphite, it’s also available in light grey and midnight teal colors. The top of the mouse is coated in a rubberized plastic with a grippy matte feel. The sides are a smooth, semi-glossy plastic while the thumb rest is a faceted version of the rubberized plastic found on the top of the mouse. 

 

A nice design element we noticed in our testing was the placement of the micro USB charging port. The port is dead-center on the front of the mouse, meaning it’s still usable while charging, unlike Apple’s Magic Mouse which puts it on the bottom.  

 
It won’t be the best for gaming, nor does it include too many fancy features, but it has just enough to keep the input experience comfortable and convenient.
 

One omission is the lack of a place to store the included Bluetooth receiver. It’s not required to connect to a computer, as long as the computer or device you’re using the mouse with has Bluetooth, but it’d still be nice to at least have the option to take it along when traveling. 

 
##   Setup Process: Quick and easy  
 

Setting up the Logitech MX Master 2S was as simple as plugging in the Bluetooth receiver and turning the mouse on. If you’re using the mouse with a secondary or tertiary computer, the process of connecting via Bluetooth isn’t more challenging, but does require you to go through the standard Bluetooth pairing process to complete the connection. 

 

After the mouse has been turned on and the device number selected (using the button located on the bottom of the mouse and denoted with a white LED), all that’s needed is to go through the setup dialog of the Windows or macOS computer you want to connect. We paired our unit with two macOS computers and one Windows computer. 

 

After the device selection was done, the response was instantaneous, making for a seamless transition between devices. Admittedly, we would’ve liked to see the option to switch devices from the top or side of the mouse, but we understand not everyone has the need to make rapid changes between devices that a dedicated button would afford. 

 

As for the buttons on the device, the scroll wheel and left/right mouse buttons work as you’d expect by default. The additional scroll by the thumb is used to scroll across pages and documents horizontally. The two other buttons on the thumb-side of the device are, by default, set as forward and backward shortcuts, which was very beneficial when browsing the web. 

 

Defaults aside, all of the controls can be customized with Logitech Options, a supplementary program for Logitech devices that adds the ability to switch what the buttons do, adjust the various usage modes, and check on battery life. 

 
##   Wireless: Lag-free and reliable  
 

The Logitech MX Master 2S features Bluetooth Low Energy and a dedicated 2.4GHz receiver to connect to Windows and macOS computers. We tested the mouse for more than 50 hours across three devices and didn’t notice any discrepancies between using the mouse with the included receiver versus using it with standard Bluetooth. 

 

Logitech says the mouse can be used for up to 40 days on a single charge, but notes it can vary based on the computer and settings used. With our usage—which started with a completely-charged battery—the mouse seems to be on target for about 30 days of battery life at default settings, with 5 hours of use a day. 

 
##   Performance: Decent across the board  
 

The Logitech MX Master 2S isn’t a dedicated gaming mouse, but it doesn’t lack in the precision department. It features Logitech’s “Ultimate” laser technology with a Dots Per Inch (a measure of sensitivity) range between 200 DPI and 4000 DPI, which can be adjusted in increments of 50 DPI using Logitech’s software. 

 

We tested the mouse out on multiple surfaces and didn’t experience any issues, whether it was a hardwood desk or glass-topped desk. Logitech does note that while the mouse works with glass desks, the glass needs to be at least 4mm thick. We did occasionally notice hiccups when using it with glass that had scratches on it, but we didn’t notice any latency issues with the mouse, regardless of whether we were using it with the receiver or via Bluetooth.

 
##   Comfort: Fits like a glove  
 

From the moment we took it out of the box we had a feeling the Master 2S would be comfortable. Logitech has spent many years refining the ergonomics of its MX peripherals and the MX Master 2S is what happens when everything just comes together. Its bulbous top provides a nice arch for your palm, the buttons are nicely placed, and the extended thumb rest gives added control when moving the mouse around, while also serving as a nice resting place for your thumb. All the extra buttons along with the additional scroll wheel are within easy reach. We spent over 50 hours using this mouse and we can say with confidence it’s one of the most comfortable mice we’ve tested.

##   Software: Customization galore  
 

Logitech has two programs that work alongside the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse: Logitech Options and Logitech Flow.

 

Logitech Options is available for both Windows and macOS computers. Once downloaded and installed, it gives complete control over every button and function the mouse has to offer. We were able to change what the two side buttons controlled, switch the left and right mouse click, and adjust the sensitivity all from within the program. 

 
Logitech Flow can be found in the Logitech Options program, but serves the unique purpose of offering cross-computer file transfers.
 

Logitech Flow can be found in the Logitech Options program, but serves the unique purpose of offering cross-computer file transfers. This neat little program makes it possible to transfer things like PDFs, images, and other documents from one computer to another, regardless of whether it’s a Windows or macOS device. 

 

In order for Logitech Flow to work, the program needs to be installed and set up on both devices. Once properly set up, the process of moving files is as simple as selecting the files in need of a transfer and moving the mouse to the side of the computer’s display. So long as the devices are on the same network, the files will seamlessly transition from one device to another, even without the need to switch the device link on the bottom of the mouse. It’s a neat feature overall, but it occasionally has hiccups in our experience, especially with larger files. 

 
##   Price: It’s a pretty penny  
 

Logitech lists the MX Master 2S for $99.99 (MSRP). Just shy of $100 is a bit much for a mouse, but considering it’s the most-used peripheral used to navigate any computer (aside from a keyboard) it’s important to get one that’s ergonomically sound to prevent any long-term strain injuries. Considering this mouse is likely going to outlast any computer you’re using it with, $100 is a small price to pay for long-term value. 

 
##   Competition: Ahead of the rest  
 

The second option is Logitech’s own M720 Triathlon. This mouse is a little less ergonomic than the MX Master 2S, runs on a single AA battery, and isn’t nearly as flashy in terms of materials or design. It features hyper-fast scrolling, connectivity for up to three devices, and uses Logitech Flow to transfer content from one computer to another. The M720 Triathlon comes in at half the price of the MX Master 2S at $49.99, so if you don’t mind trading a little comfort and a few features, it might be worth considering.
