The constant bombardment of unwanted calls and messages can be frustrating, time-consuming, and sometimes even dangerous. Fortunately, there are some incredibly simple hacks that you can use to banish these annoying calls and texts once and for all. Let’s take a closer look at some of the best hacks for Android that will help you take back control of your phone and your time.\nUse a Call Blocker App One of the best ways to quickly and easily block unwanted calls is to use a call blocker app. With these apps, you can create a blacklist of numbers that you want to block and they will automatically be sent to voicemail or disconnected when they try to dial your number. There are many different call blocker apps available, so it’s important to choose one that works best for you.\nCreate a Custom Contact List Another great way to block annoying calls is to create a custom contact list. This list will only allow calls and texts from people you have designated as contacts, effectively blocking all other calls and texts. This is a great way to prevent spam calls and unwanted telemarketing calls from reaching your phone.\nEnable Do Not Disturb Mode If you don’t want to be bothered by calls and texts during certain times of the day or night, it’s a good idea to enable Do Not Disturb mode. This will silence all incoming calls and notifications, allowing you to focus on other things without being interrupted. You can also enable exceptions for certain contacts, so you won’t miss any important calls or messages.\nTurn Off Caller ID Another easy hack to block unwanted calls is to turn off caller ID. This will prevent callers from identifying themselves on your phone, thus preventing them from reaching you. While this may not work for all calls, it can be a great way to avoid telemarketing calls and other calls from unknown numbers.\nUse Additional Filters Finally, you can use additional filters to block incoming calls and texts. These filters can be set up to automatically block certain numbers or specific types of calls, such as spam calls or telemarketing calls. By using these filters, you can quickly and easily block unwanted calls without having to manually block each individual number.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, there are many different hacks that you can use to banish annoying calls and texts on your Android phone. Whether you prefer to use a call blocker app, create a custom contact list, enable Do Not Disturb mode, turn off caller ID, or use additional filters, there are plenty of options available to help you take back control of your phone and your time. So why not give these simple hacks a try and see how much easier it can be to manage your calls and texts?\nAlbeit many instant messaging and voice-over-the-internet platforms and services are the most preferred communication methods for many smartphone users, there always will be a place for phone calls, and text messages too.\nA phone call is, arguably, one of the best ways to check on a person and get prompt real-time responses to questions and information — as long as the person picks up. Text messages too are an integral part of communication and internet security (think: two-factor authentication).\nHowever, despite their importance, a good number of people abuse them: spammers, telemarketers, strangers, and even friends \u0026 family. Unwanted calls and messages could get annoying. And one of the best ways to curb them is to restrict the sender/caller access to your number. If you use an Android smartphone, here are some of the ways you can block a number from calling you or sending you text messages.\nNOTE: While some of these methods are general, they could vary according to device type, model, version of operating system, phone user interface, manufacturer etc. The methods listed below are to give you an idea of where (and how) to navigate to in your smartphone to block numbers from calling or sending you a text.\n1. From your phone’s contact list If you have the number you intend to block saved on your smartphone, you can easily block them from your phone’s contact list.\nSimply open your phone’s contact list from your home screen or app tray. Alternatively, launch your Phone app and navigate to your contact list Click on the contact you’d love to block. Tap the three-dotted menu button. Tap Block from the list of options. On some device, the option could be labeled as “Block number” “Add to Blacklist” or “Add to Block list“ If you use a Samsung Phone (say Galaxy S9 or Galaxy Note 9):\nLaunch the Phone app from your Home screen\nAt the top-right corner of the screen, tap the three-dot menu icon\nTap Settings\nUnder the Call Settings menu, click on Block numbers\nOn the page, you can add new numbers to your Blocked list\nYou can also manage your list from this menu — remove numbers, automatically block unknown numbers etc.\n2. From Call Log This is preferable when you do not have the contact saved on your phone. Mind you, you can also block a saved number from your call log. Here’s how.\nLaunch your Phone app from your phone’s home screen or app tray\nFrom the list of recent calls, navigate to the number you’d love to block\nClick on the number, or the avatar beside the number, or simply long-press the number to reveal the menu\nTap on Block number\n3. From Phone Settings Launch your phone’s Settings menu Navigate and tap “Call” or “Call Settings“ Depending on your phone’s maker and model, you should see “Call Rejection” or “Call Blocking” or “Block List“ Create a new list and add contacts or numbers you want to restrict from reaching you via SMS or Phone call 4. Using Third-party Apps If your phone lacks a built-in call or SMS blocking feature, there are amazing apps on the Google PlayStore that can get the job done. Also, if your phone does have a native call blocking feature, these apps come with more advanced and sophisticated blocking features like automatic blocking of spam numbers, identification of unknown/private callers, schedule specified time for blocking calls or SMS etc. In addition, they are super easy to use and are available for FREE.\nSome of the best call and SMS blocking app for your Android Smartphone include:\nTruecaller Calls Blacklist Mr. Number Call Blocker Should I Answer? etc. 5. Blocking at Carrier or Network Provider Level While this might not be the best and most efficient method to block a number from sending you texts or calls, network providers offer such services — but for a small fee. Calls and SMS blocking varies according to your country of residence and your network provider. Contact your carrier’s support center to get more information on blocking terms and conditions as well as rates they charge for such service.\nOne advantage of blocking a number at carrier-level, however, is that unlike other methods mentioned above, if you change your phone or swap SIM cards into another device, the blocked number still won’t be able to call or text you.\nHow do you block a number from calling or texting you?\nRelated ","wordCount":"1246","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gary Brown"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-ways-to-block-specific-numbers-from-calling-or-texting-you-on-android1734695/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe how easy it is to banish annoying calls and texts with these 5 simple hacks for Android!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 20, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1246 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Gary Brown</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-from-your-phones-contact-list>1.
