# You Won't Believe What Happened With My MacBook Pro 15! The Lighting Keyboard Stopped Working! Find Out How I Fixed It Here.

As an avid MacBook Pro user, I've always considered myself to be a bit of a tech expert. However, when my beloved 15-inch MacBook Pro's lighting keyboard suddenly stopped working, I found myself stumped.

At first, I thought it might be a simple bug in the system, so I switched off my MacBook, turned it back on, and tried to type again. However, when the same issue arose, I knew it was time to take action.

After a quick Google search, I found that this was a common issue faced by MacBook Pro users. The good news, however, was that it was fixable.

The first solution I came across was to reset the NVRAM (non-volatile random-access memory) by shutting down the MacBook, pressing and holding the Command + Option + P + R keys, and then turning the MacBook back on. Unfortunately, this did not work in my case.

Next, I tried resetting the SMC (System Management Controller) by shutting down the MacBook Pro, pressing and holding the left Shift, Control, and Option keys, and then pressing the power button for 10 seconds before releasing all keys. This method also did not work.

By this point, I felt like giving up and with the pandemic going on, going to an Apple store was not possible. However, I discovered a hidden solution that did the trick.

The MacBook Pro has a setting that allows you to turn the keyboard lighting on and off. I had unknowingly turned this setting off, and that's why the backlight stopped working. Here's how to fix it:

1. Click on the Apple icon in the upper left corner of the desktop and select 'System Preferences'.

2. Select 'Keyboard'.

3. Make sure the tickbox next to 'Automatically illuminate keyboard in low light' is checked.

4. If this was already checked, uncheck it and then recheck it again.

5. Restart the MacBook Pro.

Lo and behold, my backlight keyboard was working again!

In conclusion, if you ever find yourself in a situation where the lighting keyboard on your MacBook Pro stops working, don't panic. Simply follow the steps above, and in no time, you'll have your beloved MacBook Pro up and running again.
