# Revolutionize Your Workflow with the Game-Changing Logitech MX Master 3 Wireless Mouse – Is It Worth The Upgrade?

As a professional, you’re always looking for ways to improve your workflow and productivity. And one of the most overlooked tools for doing so is the computer mouse. That’s right – a good, high-quality mouse can make a world of difference when it comes to getting things done quickly and efficiently.

Enter the Logitech MX Master 3 – a wireless mouse designed to revolutionize your workflow and take your productivity to the next level. But is it really worth the upgrade? Let’s take a closer look.

## What Makes the MX Master 3 So Special?

First off, let’s talk about what sets the MX Master 3 apart from your average mouse. This thing is packed with features that are designed to make your life easier and your workflow more efficient.

For starters, it has a high-precision sensor that tracks on practically any surface – even glass. This means you can use it on pretty much any desktop or table without having to worry about using a mouse pad.

It also has a unique thumbwheel that lets you scroll between horizontal windows or tabs, as well as a customizable button for quick access to your most-used applications or commands.

But perhaps the feature that really sets the MX Master 3 apart is its ability to work seamlessly between multiple devices. Using Logitech’s “Flow” technology, you can switch between computers or laptops with a simple press of a button – no wires or dongles required.

## How Does It Perform in the Real World?

In short, the MX Master 3 lives up to the hype. In my experience, it’s incredibly responsive and accurate, and the unique features like the thumbwheel and customizable buttons really do help speed up workflow and make tasks more efficient.

And the ability to seamlessly switch between devices is a game-changer. I frequently switch between my work laptop, personal laptop, and desktop computer – being able to use the same mouse on all three without having to fiddle with cords or dongles is an absolute dream.

## Is It Worth the Cost?

Of course, with all of these features, you’re probably wondering what the price tag looks like. And yes, the MX Master 3 is definitely a bit more expensive than your average mouse – currently priced at $99.99.

But if you’re someone who spends a lot of time on the computer and values productivity, I would argue that it’s worth the cost. This mouse can truly help you work more efficiently and get more done in less time – which can ultimately lead to increased earnings and less stress.

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the Logitech MX Master 3 wireless mouse is a game-changer when it comes to improving your workflow and productivity. Its unique features and seamless device switching make it a joy to use, and despite the higher price point, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who relies heavily on their computer mouse.

If you’re ready to invest in your wireless mouse, the Logitech MX Master 3 could be right for you. This dual Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless mouse does the basics and so much more that characterizes the Logitech MX Master Series, which is catered to creatives and coders. It’s even compatible with other series-specific peripherals including a coding-centric wireless keyboard. This advanced mouse is jam-packed with customization options while still offering a gentle learning curve.

 
##   Design: Intricate without being busy  
 

The Logitech MX Master 3 is a sleek and capable-looking mouse. It’s constructed with high-quality, tactile rubber and plastic that isn’t reflective or prone to smudging. There’s a higher arch to the device, an inch more than you’ll find in most wireless or wired mice, which makes this seem more like a vertical mouse than a traditional mouse. It’s also quite long at nearly 5 inches and allows more than 3 inches for the palm to rest. All of this is accented by a very pronounced thumb rest, which is spacious and grippy and provides easy reach to the thumb button and the buttons above it. 

 

There are seven buttons in total, but they’re arranged in an intuitive manner that doesn’t overwhelm the device. Above the thumb rest, the buttons make their way up the side of the device with a unique thumb wheel for horizontal scrolling, and continue to the top with the usual primary left and right clicks, a scroll wheel with a button click, and a shift-mode button. 

 
##   Key Features: Application shortcuts and multiple devices  
 

If you need a mouse that can multitask, the MX Master 3 has you covered. It comes with program presets for commonly used apps including Chrome and Photoshop, and you can also add your own app-specific shortcuts through the software. 

 

 The only annoyance was when I wanted to use Chrome presets, but while working in a different browser and other applications at the same time, the settings didn’t apply universally. Fortunately, this was easily fixed by assigning a workaround to another button that would help me maneuver between screens. 

 

Another helpful productivity feature of the MX Master 3 is the easy connectivity to up to three different computers. Just toggle to the corresponding number on the bottom of the mouse and connect through the Logitech Unifying Receiver or over Bluetooth. Switching between machines was instantaneous and this device-to-device ease can be extended even further with the Logi Flow technology that allows you to move from one computer to the next as if it were one machine. It was pretty easy to set up and it worked well with basic navigation, also adding drag-and-drop file transfer.

##   Performance: Precise and customizable to you  
 

The MX Master 3 is equipped with an above-average 4,000 DPI optical sensor that uses the Logitech’s Darkfield technology to provide control on every surface—including glass and glossy materials. I couldn’t test the glass performance, but I tested it on a range of light and dark woods with different finishings, a marble countertop, upholstered surfaces, and still had fairly decent control over the device regardless of the material. I also didn’t notice any instances of jumping or lag.

Accuracy was enhanced by the amount of control I had over the seven buttons. The quick shift from notched to MagSpeed electromagnetic scrolling was instantaneous. The gesture controls also allowed me to easily toggle between desktops, control media and zoom and rotate with precision.

##   Comfort: Best for larger hands  
 

Since this is categorized as a full-size mouse, I wasn’t surprised that it wasn’t very comfortable for me. In fact, it caused discomfort even after just 40 minutes of continuous use. I couldn’t maintain the right arched position while also reaching the buttons and scroll wheel comfortably. Frequent breaks helped, as did relying on buttons that were easier to reach—like the horizontal scroll wheel and gesture button at the base of the mouse. While it had less to do with comfort than experience, the virtually silent scroll wheel felt like an extra luxury despite an imperfect fit.

##   Wireless: Two seamless options  
 

The Logitech MX Master 3 offers two instant and reliable ways to connect this mouse to three different devices. I used Bluetooth with one MacBook Pro and connected via 2.4GHz wireless via the universal receiver with two others. It easily and swiftly switched back and forth, and was foolproof every time. Logitech says that the MX Master 3 has a wireless range of 10 meters, depending on your setup. I suspect that holds up based on my experience using the mouse up to 20 feet away from the corresponding device. 

 
##   Software: Instant personalization via Logitech Options   
 

While the MX Master 3 is truly full of possibility, none of that would be accessible without the Logitech Options software. It’s easy to find from the product page and is very intuitive to use and set up an account if you don’t have one. There isn’t a very detailed set of options or macro keybind control. 

 

 There are three main tabs that help you narrow down button customization, your pointing and scrolling preferences, and setting up Flow so that you can move between connected computers. Any machine you use Flow with must also have the Logitech Options software installed.

 

 If you do share this mouse with other users in the family or work on multiple machines, the settings dedicated to one machine will remain untouched and intact even if they’re different on another one. Other software perks include automatic cloud backups of mouse settings in the event that you’d like to restore previous settings.

 
##   Price: A bit of a splurge  
 

At $100, the Logitech MX Master 3 isn’t a bargain. But it’s really not supposed to be. Given the array of customizations, app settings, and the technology under the hood, the price, while slightly steep, does seem quite fair. 

 

Compared to other models like the Apple Magic Mouse 2, which is about $20 less, the MX Master 3 has a distinct edge when it comes to customization and cross-platform compatibility. Even the similarly priced Microsoft Precision Mouse doesn’t offer the same depth of customization and control.
