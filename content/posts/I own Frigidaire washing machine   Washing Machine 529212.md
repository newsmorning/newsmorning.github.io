# You Won't Believe the Secret Features of My Frigidaire Washing Machine - Get Ready to be Amazed!

When it comes to choosing a washing machine, we all look for the basic features of cleaning clothes, gentle on the fabric, and quick drying time. But what if your washing machine had some secret features that you never knew existed? Yes, you heard it right! My Frigidaire Washing Machine has some amazing secret features that have made my life a lot easier. Today, I am going to spill the beans on these features that will leave you amazed.

## Delay Start Feature

I never thought the Delay Start feature would be so handy until I started using it daily. This feature allows me to set a time for my washing machine to start, and it starts automatically at the specified time. This means that I can set up the washing machine to start just before I wake up, and I can sleep peacefully while my laundry is being done. This feature is especially helpful for people who have a busy schedule and forget to start a load of laundry.

## Stain Soak Option

Frigidaire Washing Machine comes with a Stain Soak option, which helps in removing tough stains effortlessly. This feature is perfect for those who have kids or pets at home, and their clothes get dirty often. Soak the clothes in the washer for some time before starting the wash cycle, and voila! The stubborn stains are gone.

## Quick Wash Cycle

I am sure we all have been in a situation where we need to wash clothes urgently, and we don't have much time. Frigidaire Washing Machine has got us covered with its Quick Wash Cycle. This feature can wash your clothes in just 20 minutes, saving a lot of time and energy.

## Automatic Dispenser

Gone are the days when you have to measure and put detergent and fabric softener manually. Frigidaire Washing Machine comes with an Automatic Dispenser, which dispenses the detergent and fabric softener automatically. This feature allows me to put a large quantity of detergent and softener, and it lasts for days. This saves me from the hassle of measuring and putting it every time I need to wash clothes.

## Cycle Notifications

Last but not least, Frigidaire Washing Machine has Cycle Notifications, which informs you about the cycle's progress. This means that you can know when the wash cycle is about to end, and you can plan your day ahead. This feature is perfect for those who have a busy schedule and need to complete their work on time.

In conclusion, Frigidaire Washing Machine has some amazing secret features that have made my life a lot easier. From Delay Start Feature to Cycle Notifications, these features have made laundry day a relaxing and hassle-free experience.

## Chosen Solution
 My washing machine does not pump the water out after washing. I have to empty it by hand.....a technician told me that it is a computerised machine and an entire circuit board has to change, but I cannot find a dealer in my area who sells that particular board.....so do i have to dump a somewhat good machine?

 Keith:
I feel your pain.  If you are going to have to replace the computerized board, may I suggest another approach?  Look in your area for a store that sells refurbished appliances, and get yourself the biggest capacity old-fashioned Kenmore washer that they sell.  It will certainly work well for a while, since they have refurbished it.  And it will be very easy to repair, should a problem develop.  There are plenty of YouTube videos on these washers covering every possible thing that can go wrong with them.
The old-fashioned (that is, non-computerized) Kenmore washer and dryer are the standard that just about all washers and dryers followed for decades, that is, until they started computerizing them.  I have a Kenmore-compatible washer and dryer.  I recently took my dryer apart, vacuumed out all of the lint that was in it, and replaced the belt; then I put it back together.  It was easy to do all of that, and now the dryer works like new.  (It wasn't drying the clothes very well before I did that.)
These machines are fun to repair, and all parts are readily available everywhere.
Good luck!
