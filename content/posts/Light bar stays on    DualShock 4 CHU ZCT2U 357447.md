Shockingly Irritating: Why Your Dualshock 4 Chu Zct2U Light Bar Refuses to Turn Off!

Do you find it frustrating that the light bar on your Dualshock 4 Chu Zct2U controller never turns off? Even when you're using your console in the dark, the light bar stays on, draining the life out of your controller's battery.

The Dualshock 4 controller was designed for the PlayStation 4 console and comes with a variety of features, including the light bar. The light bar is located on the back of the controller and is used to display different colors to indicate the player's status. For example, when the player is playing a game, the light bar will usually glow blue. In some games, the light bar changes color according to the player's gameplay, such as red when the player is low on health or white during a reload.

To save on battery life, many players would like to turn off the light bar when it's not needed. However, the light bar on the Dualshock 4 Chu Zct2U controller doesn't turn off automatically, which can be frustrating for many users.

One way to turn off the light bar is to hold down the PlayStation button on the controller for 10 seconds until the light bar turns off. However, this method also disables some features, such as vibration, the touchpad, and the gyroscope, which can be necessary in some games.

Another option is to change the brightness of the light bar. You can do this by going to the Settings menu on your PlayStation 4 console and selecting Devices > Controllers > Brightness of DUALSHOCK 4 Light Bar. Here, you can lower the brightness of the light bar or set it to turn off after a certain amount of time.

If neither of these options work for you, there are also third-party applications you can use to turn off the light bar. These apps, such as DS4Windows, allow you to control the light bar's behavior and turn it off completely.

In conclusion, the light bar on the Dualshock 4 Chu Zct2U controller can be a useful feature in some games, but it can also be frustrating when it stays on constantly. However, there are several ways to turn off the light bar, either by changing its brightness, using the PlayStation button, or downloading a third-party application. So, don't let the constant glow of the light bar drain the life out of your controller, take control of it and enjoy your PlayStation 4 experience without any interruptions!


## Chosen Solution
 I have a ps4 days of play edition with the matching remote, I checked the model number and based on the fact it has the two light bars I know it’s a newer model remote (I also found out with a fix I tried), I was charging it on a portable charger, which I’d done before with my gen 1 remote, and after a few days of doing that I noticed the remote would tweak. First it started with the ps4 constantly showing it charging even when it wasn’t, then when I unplug it it’ll stay connected normally but if I turn the remote off it thinks that it’s still charging as the orange light on the light bars turns on. If I try to reconnect the controller to the ps4 without a cable the white light will blink once or twice and go back to orange and after repeated tries the light will freeze white. When I plug it in the light goes away and turns orange again and if I turn on the remote it turns on normally and pairs and works fine. At first I thought it could be a battery issue, I haven’t had it very long (6 months max) but I thought maybe the portable fried the battery so I bought two replacements and replacing the battery only fixed the problem that it didn’t have any charge and wasn’t accepting it anymore. I’ve tried pressing the reset button on the back, unpairing and repairing it, I’ve tried everything and nothing works. Help?

 Hi! I don’t think this is a battery issue. I think it’s the LED/Charging Port OR the cable which isn’t working as it should. Everything works fine, right? check the board and the cable. How do you charge it normally? Just with the USB cable?
