# Revolutionary new feature revealed: Live translation sets Apple Glasses apart from other smart glasses!

Apple's highly anticipated augmented reality (AR) smart glasses are set to release in the coming years, and the tech giant has just revealed a groundbreaking new feature that sets their device apart from all the other smart glasses on the market: live translation.

The Apple Glasses, which are yet to be officially named, are a highly sophisticated AR device that overlays digital information onto the real world. It is said to feature a range of sensors, cameras, and microphones to create an immersive and interactive experience for the wearer.

Live translation will be one of the most significant features of the Apple Glasses, enabling users to receive real-time translations of foreign languages as they get spoken. This feature is expected to make life more accessible and less daunting for tourists, business travelers, and even for locals struggling to communicate in foreign countries.

Apple has always been a company that focuses on making technology more accessible to people, and the live translation feature is a prime example of that. With this feature, Apple can make it easier for people to adjust to new surroundings, speak with locals, and immerse themselves in new cultures, without feeling limited by language barriers.

The live translation feature also opens up a world of possibilities when it comes to communication. Imagine being able to have a conversation with someone who speaks a completely different language right in front of you, and still be able to understand each other. This is no longer just a dream – it is now a reality with Apple Glasses.

Tech enthusiasts and industry experts have lauded Apple for thinking outside the box and coming up with such a revolutionary feature that has the potential to transform the way we communicate with people around the world. The live translation feature is just the start of what could be a new era in AR technology.

The release of Apple Glasses will be exciting, and the unveiling of the live translation feature has taken this excitement to the next level. It is yet another reason why Apple remains a significant player in the tech industry, continually pushing boundaries and setting new standards.

In conclusion, the live translation feature is a game-changer for the Apple Glasses and sets them apart from other smart glasses on the market. We are excited to see how this feature will change the way we communicate with people across the globe and how it will shape the future of AR technology.

Apple's new Live Captions add real-time subtitles to anything, including the person standing in front of you. 

 
- New accessibility features include Live Captions generated in real-time, for any video or conversation. If this feature isn’t made for Apple’s rumored AR glasses, we’ll eat our virtual emoji hat.Apple has a history of trialing future product features inside current devices.

 

Just like Google's concept AR Glasses, announced this week. Apple's Live Captions can take incoming audio and transcribe it instantly. The difference is that Apple's version will ship "later this year," which probably means it will be in this fall's iOS 16 release. But the real news here is that this is Apple's most obvious stab yet at trialing future Apple Glasses features in plain sight. 

 

"As someone who has two parents who both have difficulty hearing, this stands to be a big help," writes Apple-centric journalist Dan Moren on his personal Six Colors blog. "I am curious to see how well the feature actually works and how it handles a big FaceTime call with a lot of participants; Apple says it will attribute dialog to specific speakers." 

 
##   Sleight of Hand  
 

Live Captions, which we’ll get to in a second, is far from the first AR glasses feature that Apple has trialed. The most obvious is the inclusion of LIDAR cameras in iPhones and iPads. These scanners help create an accurate 3D map of the world outside and allow the iPhone to overlay 3D models onto the real world shown through the camera. 

 

So far, this tech has been used to let you preview new Apple computers on your own desk, play AR Lego games, test out IKEA furniture in your living room, and so on. LIDAR hardware is so absurdly redundant in iPhones that it must only be there so Apple can hone the hardware and software for a real AR application: Apple Glasses. 

 
I'm not sure we can trust Apple's live translation better than Google's new AR glasses, but I think we can trust that the competition will help breed the best results.
 

It’s not just visual AR, either. AirPods have been adding neat AR features for years now. The latest, Spatial Audio, tricks our brains into thinking that sounds are coming from all around us and is a great way to watch movies or listen to relaxing soundscapes. It’s a great feature, but it will be even better when it works with Apple’s expected future glasses product. Being able to place sounds in a 3D space to match the AR objects will really sell the illusion. 

 

Or how about Live Text, the iOS 15 technology that recognizes and reads text in photos, and live, through the iPhone’s camera? That’s another feature that is ideal for reading signs, menus, and other text through AR glasses. 

 
##   Live Captions  
 

Live Captions takes speech from a FaceTime call, video-conferencing apps, streaming video, and so on. Your phone takes the audio and transcribes it on-the-fly, providing subtitles, as seen in this video. 

 

That's great, but what's even better is that nothing ever leaves your iPhone. The captions, says Apple, are generated on-device instead of being sent off to a server. This is not only more private, it's also a lot faster.

 

"I'm not sure we can trust Apple's live translation better than Google's new AR glasses, but I think we can trust that the competition will help breed the best results," Kristen Bolig, founder of SecurityNerd, told Lifewire via email. "Now that the competition is public and the issues with this kind of technology (privacy, accuracy, etc..) are well known, both companies will not only be in a race to create the best product first but also to create the product that best solves these problems."

 

We'd also expect some kind of built-in auto-translation like you can get right now using third-party app Navi to auto-translate your FaceTime conversations, or perhaps a way to save these transcriptions during interviews for easier access later. 

 

We've long enjoyed excellent accessibility features from Apple, letting us customize our iOS devices to an almost absurd extent. From tweaking the display to make colors and text easier to see, to controlling the entire user interface with external devices, to having the phone notify you when somebody rings the doorbell, or a delivery van arrives outside. 

 

Now, we're all getting the benefits of Apple's increased research into augmented reality tech. We might not care for IKEA or LEGO, nor even want to ever buy a pair of Apple's fabled AR glasses device, but that doesn't mean we can't all enjoy the fruits of that research.
