You Won't Believe What's Causing The Acer Aspire E14 to Shut Off After Only 5 Seconds! Find Out How To Fix It Now!

Is your Acer Aspire E14 shutting down unexpectedly, making it impossible to get any work done? Perhaps you've been facing the frustrating issue where the laptop only stays on for a few seconds before shutting down, no matter what you do! Well, you're not alone. Many Acer Aspire E14 users have been experiencing this problem, and it can be quite hard to figure out the cause. Fortunately, there's a solution to this issue, and we'll guide you through how to fix it.

So, what's causing this problem? It's possibly the thermal paste or a malfunctioning fan.

Thermal paste is essential for ensuring proper heat transfer between the processor and heat sink. When the thermal paste becomes dry or frayed, it can result in poor heat transfer, leading to overheating, which then causes the computer to turn off to avoid damage to the internal components.

The cooling fan helps regulate the temperature of your device to prevent it from overheating. If the fan is not working or malfunctioning, then the temperature inside the device will rise, causing your laptop to shut down unexpectedly before damage occurs.

To fix this problem, you may have to replace or clean the thermal paste and the cooling fan.

Step 1: Turn off the laptop and unplug the charger from the wall socket.

Step 2: Remove the back panel of the laptop. Depending on the model, you might need to unscrew the panel or remove some clips. In case you are unsure, you can look up your laptop model online for disassembly instructions.

Step 3: Check for the cooling fan and clean it thoroughly with compressed air. You may also use a brush to remove any debris or dust that may cause damage to the fan.

Step 4: Remove the heatsink by unscrewing it and gently lift it off the processor. Check the thermal paste and clean it with a soft cloth or cotton swabs.

Step 5: Apply a fresh layer of thermal paste on the processor, making sure that it's distributed evenly. You can do this using a spatula or a piece of plastic. Reassemble the heatsink.

Step 6: Reassemble the laptop by aligning the back panel and screwing it back in place.

Step 7: Power up the device and test whether the shut-down issue has been resolved.

If this solution doesn't work, there might be another underlying issue. We recommend reaching out to a professional for further assistance.

In conclusion, if your Acer Aspire E14 laptop is encountering an issue where it shuts down after only a few seconds, it may likely be due to a faulty cooling fan or dry thermal paste. By following the steps mentioned above, you can troubleshoot and fix this problem. Doing this will not only save you time and money but also extend the lifespan of your laptop.

## Chosen Solution
 I was using my Acer Aspire E14 laptop when it suddenly shut down out of nowhere. I charged it until it's full. (The battery indicator lights are still working.)
But whenever I press start button, it doesn't turn on anymore. I can hear the mechanics inside start, but turn off immediately after about 5 seconds. Is it a fan failure? What could it be?

 The device is not POSTing. This essentially means that the BIOS is not initializing due to hardware failure.  The issue is most likely motherboard failure in which case you may be better off getting a new device. It could be another hardware issue too, while unlikely.
Edit: Fixed my grammar.

 There may be signs of overheating, computer will shut off to protect itself and you. There may be a buildup of dust with in the fan, I suggest opening it up and blowing the dust out (some use compressed air available in a small can ).  If this does not fix the issue, fan may have to be replaced.

 I have same kind of problem i thought it was black screen of death but its not . I was using this for power point i shut it down properly. Then i open it recently and i only hear fan and mechanics and very dark gray light then shuts . Im thinking if i need to replace new charger or batterry .brand Acer Aspire E14
