# You Won't Believe How Dealply Adware is Sneaking onto Your PC Using Microsoft's Own Security!

Tech giants Microsoft have been known to provide their users with some of the best and most advanced security features that help to protect them from harmful cyber-attacks. However, experts have recently discovered some serious issues with one of Microsoft's own security tools, that has been permitting the Dealply adware to sneak into users' PCs.

This exploit discovered within Microsoft's security service is highly dangerous as Dealply is a potentially unwanted program (PUP). These PUPs often place adverts on a user's computer and can even gain access to their personal data, causing numerous issues with privacy.

# Tracing the Problem

Investigations into this issue found that Dealply is able to bypass Microsoft's own security services through exploiting its vulnerability in the File Quarantine Service. This particular service is used by Microsoft's own antimalware tool to monitor the files on the hard disk that are accessed by applications.

Dealply, being a PUP, isn't considered to contain any malicious code or to be dangerous by conventional malware algorithms. This has led to it being deemed "safe" by the File Quarantine Service, which means users unknowingly permit it to be installed onto their PCs.

# Why is Dealply So Dangerous?

As a PUP, Dealply doesn't hold any dangerous code, but its installation on your PC could result in a complete breach in your privacy. Once installed, this unwanted software tends to place adverts on your system by monitoring your web behavior, including searching habits and websites that you visit.

Apart from the security threat mentioned above, having Dealply on your system can often lead to a slow and laggy performance. This is because it's programmed to run in the background, constantly using your resources for finding ads to place on your system.

# Protecting Yourself

Even though Microsoft is supposed to provide one of the most advanced security features, it's shocking to see how Dealply managed to exploit this major vulnerability. However, there are steps that one can take to protect themselves from this particular threat.

Firstly, it's better to use third-party antivirus software that can keep track of all digital activities happening on your system. Secondly, avoid downloading any software from any websites that aren't trustworthy or are less known. Lastly, if you're writing to Microsoft for technical support, it's always essential that you have the latest version of their antimalware tool installed on your system.

# Final Thoughts

Although Microsoft is known to be one of the world's most prominent tech giants, this exploit discovered in their File Quarantine service is considerably damaging to the user. Dealply and other PUPs have found a way to bypass one of the security services of Microsoft, making it even more important to protect our digital assets from these unwanted programs by being wary of the software downloads we occasionally make. As they say, prevention is always better than cure.


A new DealPly variant which abuses Microsoft’s SmartScreen API to avoid detection was discovered by security researchers.
 
### What is DealPly and how it works?
 
If you didn’t know already, DealPly is an adware strain that installs browser extensions on your browser and displays advertisements. To remain undetected, it abuses Microsoft’s reputation services.
 
Here’s how enSilo’s research team, who discovered the intrusion, describes it:
 

 
Besides of modular code, machine fingerprinting, VM detection techniques and robust C&C infrastructure, the most intriguing discovery was the way DealPly abuses Microsoft and McAfee reputation services to remain under the radar.
 
 
 
Even though Windows Defender SmartScreen is designed to warn Windows 10 users when they access domains with malware or phishing potential, DealPly bypassed it.
 
It does that by taking advantage of infected Windows 10 PCs and using them to further distribute the infection.
 
DealPly uses JSON-based API requests, then sends info to SmartScreen’s reputation server, waits for the response and when it gets it, it collects data and sends it back to DealPly’s C2 server.
 
### I’m not using Windows 10. Could DealPly affect me?
 
It’s worth mentioning that DealPly has support for multiple versions of the undocumented SmartScreen API. This means that it has the ability to infect multiple Windows versions, not just Windows 10, as researchers explain:
 
To keep your PC safe, make sure that you always keep your Windows updated, use an antimalware or an antivirus solution, and surf the web on a privacy-based browser.
 
It is important to note that the SmartScreen API is undocumented. This means the author has put a lot of effort in reverse engineering the inner workings of the SmartScreen mechanismfeature.
