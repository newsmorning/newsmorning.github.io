Windows Phone 8.1 brings a huge load of fresh changes to Microsoft handsets, perhaps the most important feature the tech giant is rolling out is Cortana, its digital assistant similar to Apple’s Siri. However in April the company showed off a lock screen app that added the ability to change the experience of your phone with modern animations – in a way, it looks a lot like the Lock screen in Windows 8.1.
 
Sadly, the lock screen “feature” didn’t come included in the update, but today Microsoft is delivering on the promise as the Live Lock Screen app is now available for download from the Windows Phone Store as beta, meaning that it works, but not quite well as the company wants it.
 
The app adds another way for Windows Phone users to personalize their phones with six new lock screen layouts. Each layout has been designed to shows time, date, notifications, and a custom unlock animation.
 
The Live Lock Screen app also let users choose their own images to display in the lock screen and there is also the option to let Bing bring a new image every day.
 
Here is a great video from WPCentral that shows the app fully:
 

 
The app is beta, so you’ll notice a bit of lag and glitches while using it, but hopefully this will be fixed by the time Microsoft removes the beta label. Furthermore, the app works on phones with 512MB of memory – this is a good news as Microsoft specified that the app will require 1GB of memory as a requirement.
