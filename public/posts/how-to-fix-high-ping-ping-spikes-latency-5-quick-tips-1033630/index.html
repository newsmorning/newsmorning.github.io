Do you often find yourself losing online games due to poor internet connections? Don’t worry! You’re not alone. High ping and lag can be a major issue for gamers, especially those who want to enjoy smooth online gaming experience. However, there are some quick and easy tips that you can apply to say goodbye to high ping and lag once and for all.\nUse an ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi: One of the major causes of high ping and lag is a poor connection. If you’re using Wi-Fi, there are chances that you may experience frequent disconnects, which can cause you to lose the game. Therefore, it’s recommended to use an ethernet cable to connect your computer or console to the router. Ethernet cables provide a faster and more stable connection, which leads to a better gaming experience.\nClose unnecessary programs: Sometimes, high ping and lag can be caused by other programs that consume internet bandwidth. Therefore, it’s important to close all unnecessary programs, especially those that run in the background or auto-update frequently. This will free up some bandwidth, which will reduce lag and improve your gaming performance.\nChoose servers closer to your location: Sometimes, high ping and lag can be caused by connecting to servers that are far away from your location. Therefore, it’s important to choose servers that are closest to your location. This will reduce the distance the data has to travel, which will result in a lower ping and better gaming experience.\nUpgrade your internet connection: If you’re using a slow internet connection, there are chances that you may experience high ping and lag. If possible, consider upgrading your internet plan to get faster download and upload speeds. This will lead to a more stable and faster connection, resulting in a better gaming experience.\nUse a gaming VPN: Lastly, if you’re still experiencing high ping and lag, it’s recommended to use a gaming VPN. A gaming VPN can help reduce lag and ping by connecting you to a server that’s optimized for gaming. Moreover, it can also reduce the chances of ISP throttling, which can slow down your connection during peak hours.\nConclusion:\nBy following these tips, you can say goodbye to high ping and lag and enjoy a smooth online gaming experience. Remember, a stable and fast internet connection is crucial to enjoying online games like a pro. So, make sure to apply these tips to ensure that you have a great gaming experience every time.\nHigh latency after Windows 10 upgrade is one of the most common issues and can cause big-time trouble during your gaming sessions.\nTweak network settings and connect to a VPN server to fix high ping High latency in games after a Windows 10 upgrade can be caused by Ethernet and Wi-Fi problems.\nDisable any third-party antivirus tools that could affect the data flow on your bandwidth.\nUsing a stable VPN optimized for gaming will also quickly fix high ping during your sessions.\nDownload Restoro PC Repair Tool that comes with Patented Technologies (patent available here).\nClick Start Scan to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems.\nClick Repair All to fix issues affecting your computer’s security and performance\nRestoro has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.\nReports show that ping spikes are common.
