Title: You won't believe what happened when I lost my Asus laptop password - I NEED YOUR HELP!

Introduction:
Losing a password can be a frustrating experience, especially if it's your laptop password. You are locked out of your laptop, and all your essential data is at risk. I found myself in this situation recently when I lost my Asus laptop password. I tried all possible solutions I could think of, but nothing worked. I am writing this article to share my story and seek your help.

Body:
I have been using my Asus laptop for the past three years. It was my loyal companion throughout my undergraduate degree, and I have grown attached to it. However, while I was working on it last week, I realized I had forgotten my password. I tried all possible combinations, but none of them worked. The more I tried, the more frustrated I became. I didn't want to lose access to my data, so I decided to seek a solution.

The first thing I did was to search for solutions online. I found many articles and videos suggesting various methods to reset the password, but most of them didn't work. I even tried some third-party software that claimed to reset the password, but they all turned out to be scams. I was afraid that I might lose my data if I kept trying different methods, so I stopped.

As a last resort, I decided to seek help from Asus customer support. I contacted them, and they responded promptly. The representative asked me for my serial number and other details to verify my ownership of the laptop. After verifying my details, the representative helped me reset the password. It was a simple solution, but I couldn't have done it without their help.

Conclusion:
Losing a password can be a frustrating experience, but there are solutions available. While it's tempting to try different methods, it's important to seek help from experts to ensure the safety of your data. In my case, I was able to recover my data and access my laptop because I sought help from the right people. If you find yourself in a similar situation, don't panic, and seek help from experts. It can save you from losing more than just your password!

## Chosen Solution

 Hi All,
For those having password issues,

Subtract current year and get the password
e.g.
2018 - 10 = 2008
2017 - 10 = 2007
.. etc
For example:
At the password prompt, press alt+rTake note of the date displayed. For me it was 2017-05-11Use Ctrl+F to search the paste bin for your month and date. I used "-05-11"Use the codes you find until one of them works. Mine was the same code as 2007-05-11 from the paste bin.It looks like the codes might repeat every 10 years. So I would suggest starting with the month and date combination from 10 years prior to whatever date is displayed after you press alt+r.
