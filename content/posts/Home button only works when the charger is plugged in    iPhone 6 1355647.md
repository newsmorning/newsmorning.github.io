Title: The SHOCKING REVELATION: Iphone 6 users can ONLY use home button with charger plugged in?!

Have you ever experienced a sudden malfunction of your Iphone 6 that left you feeling stunned and helpless? If you own an Iphone 6 or 6 plus, there may be a hidden flaw that you are not aware of - it may be possible that your phone's home button will only work if it is connected to a charging cable!

A recent discovery has brought to light that many Iphone 6 users have been experiencing this unusual phenomenon. The home button of their Iphone 6 only responds when the phone is connected to a charger. As soon as the charger is removed, the home button stops functioning completely. This creates a significant challenge for users who have to deal with a frustratingly limited and unpredictable phone experience.

Although this may seem unbelievable, it is a real issue that is plaguing Iphone 6 users around the world. The problem appears to have arisen due to a flaw in the phone's design, which causes the home button to stop working when there is a battery issue. This peculiar behaviour of the phone has left many users searching for answers and wondering if they should switch to another brand altogether.

For many Iphone 6 users, the home button is an essential tool that allows them to navigate their phone and access important features quickly. Without the home button, the phone becomes almost unusable, leading to further frustration and inconvenience. The problem is made worse by the fact that Apple is no longer offering the Iphone 6 and 6 plus as part of its current product line, which means that users cannot get the issue resolved through Apple's standard warranty channels.

As an Iphone 6 user, it is essential to know that this problem exists and what steps you can take to fix it. Although there is no guaranteed solution, there are steps that you can take to regain the full functionality of your phone. One option is to try a hard reset, which can help to address any software issues that may be causing the problem. You can also try restoring your phone to its factory settings or contacting Apple's technical support team for further advice.

In conclusion, the revelation that Iphone 6 users can only use the home button when the charger is plugged in may come as a shock to many people. However, it is a genuine problem that has affected several users worldwide. If you are an Iphone 6 user, it is essential to be aware of this issue and take steps to resolve it. With a little perseverance and the right support, you can regain the full functionality of your phone and avoid the frustration that comes with an unreliable home button.

## Chosen Solution
 Recently my home button has lost functionality and is very unresponsive. It doesnâ€™t work 90% of the time. Although when I plug my charger in, it starts working perfectly fine.

 That is a weird issue. My guess is that there is liquid damage corrosion at the home button plug.
