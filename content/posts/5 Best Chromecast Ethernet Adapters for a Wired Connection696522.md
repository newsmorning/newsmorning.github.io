Google Chromecast is one of the best devices you can use to stream content from your phone to a TV. However, if your WiFi connection is weak or spotty, you may not be able to use Chromecast.
 
While you can still use a Chromecast without WiFi if you’re able to access an Ethernet connection, not all Chromecast models offer Ethernet support, except for the Chromecast Ultra.
 
With a Chromecast Ethernet adapter, you can hard-wire directly into your Ethernet port and eliminate all the WiFi-related issues you may face. Other benefits of an Ethernet connection include faster network performance and smoother streaming without skipping or buffering as you’ll have one less high-bandwidth device on your network.
 

 
## Best Chromecast Ethernet Adapters
 
Here are the best Chromecast Ethernet adapters you can use with Chromecast to cast content on your screen with consistent stream quality.
 
#### 1. Google Ethernet Adapter for Chromecast
 
If you have the Chromecast Ultra, you won’t need to buy an Ethernet adapter separately because it comes with an Ethernet connector on the power adapter. For other Chromecast models like the Chromecast with Google TV or Chromecast 3, you’ll need a separate accessory.
 
Google offers an official Chromecast Ethernet adapter for the Chromecast with Google TV, which you can connect directly to your router and enjoy a fast and reliable connection for your Chromecast. 
 
The adapter is especially useful for WiFi spots that are hard to reach, and for streaming games with Stadia support. In addition, the Google Ethernet adapter comes with an integrated USB-C cable and a port on the opposite side. 
 
To set up the Google Ethernet adapter, attach the USB cable to your Chromecast, run the Ethernet cable from your router to the power outlet, and plug in.
 
#### 2. UGREEN Ethernet Adapter
 
UGREEN is a simple and efficient Chromecast Ethernet adapter that enables you to access faster and more stable internet access where there’s no wireless router or the WiFi signal is weak.
 
The adapter plugs directly into the micro-USB port on your Chromecast (3/2/1) and adds a built-in USB cable to plug into your TV’s USB port or a wall adapter. On top of that, it has an Ethernet port so you can stream content easily.
 
To use the UGREEN adapter, run an Ethernet cable from your router to the adapter and start streaming your favorite content. The cable is 3.3 feet long so you won’t need to worry about the cable hanging in the air or making your Ethernet connection loose.
 
The UGREEN Ethernet adapter also works with a Fire TV Stick 4K, Google Home Mini and Raspberry Pi Zero.
 
#### 3. Cable Matters Micro-USB to Ethernet Adapter
 
Cable Matters Micro USB to Ethernet adapter is a solid solution if you’re struggling with buffering and video lag issues over your WiFi connection. Unlike other Chromecast Ethernet adapters on this list, which transmit data at 100Mbps, this one supports Ethernet speed up to 480Mbps, which is almost five times what the other adapters transmit.
 
On top of that, the Cable Matters adapter comes with 3-foot cables for the USB and Micro-USB, which make it easy to set up no matter how you’ve configured your entertainment center.
 
However, the adapter isn’t compatible with smartphones and laptops, and it doesn’t support other devices like Fire TV (Gen 1) and Roku.
 
#### 4. Smays Ethernet Adapter
 
The Smays Ethernet adapter is portable and compact sized, making it ideal to add wired internet to your Chromecast whether you’re at home or traveling.
 
The adapter comes with a powered OTG cable for power supply, powered OTG hub to add storage to your host device, and a LAN port with 10/100 Mbps to add wired internet connection. The hub is useful when you want to plug in your wireless keyboard or mouse for easier navigation or to connect an external flash drive and access your files from a streaming device.
 
Plus, it’s easy to use and driver-free so you need only plug and play to connect to stable wired internet and stream content without lag or buffering.
 
#### 5. Snowpink Ethernet Adapter
 
Snowpink Ethernet adapter is a simple and reliable Chromecast Ethernet adapter that delivers a stable 10/100Mbps wired internet connection. The 3-foot Micro-USB cable delivers power to your Chromecast so you can enjoy faster, stable connection with uninterrupted viewing.
 
The adapter is also compatible with other devices such as Google Home Mini and Raspberry Pi Zero, but doesn’t support Fire Stick (Gen 1), Roku Express, smartphones or tablets.
 
You don’t need to install any driver program to use the Snowpink Ethernet adapter. Just plug your Chromecast into the HDMI port on your TV, connect the Micro-USB cable into the Chromecast, and then connect the Ethernet cable to the Ethernet port on the Snowpink adapter.
 
## Enjoy Consistent Stream Quality
 
Whether you’re watching Netflix with friends or you need to cast a Zoom meeting onto a bigger monitor, you’ll find plenty of Ethernet adapters that can provide a fast and stable wired connection.
