Imagine plugging in your Moto G5 Plus to charge, only for the cord to suddenly explode, causing damage and posing a serious threat to your safety. That's exactly what happened to one user, and it serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers lurking in chargers and cables.

When it comes to charging our devices, it's crucial to take safety seriously. In this article, we'll discuss what happened in the Moto G5 Plus charge cord explosion and how you can avoid such dangerous situations.

### The Incident

The Moto G5 Plus charge cord explosion occurred in early 2021, and it left one user shaken and disappointed. According to the account, the cord was plugged into an electrical outlet, and the phone was connected to the other end for charging. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, followed by sparks and smoke. The cord had exploded, causing damage to the outlet and wall, and potentially putting the user at risk of injury.

### The Cause

Several factors could have contributed to the Moto G5 Plus charge cord explosion, but the most likely cause is a short circuit. When a cord is damaged or frayed, the wires inside can come into contact and create a path for an electrical current to flow. This can lead to overheating, arcing, or even a fire or explosion.

Another possible cause of the explosion is the use of a cheap or counterfeit charger or cable. These products often lack the safety features and certifications that legitimate chargers have, and as a result, they can pose a serious risk to users.

### The Solution

To avoid the dangers of a charge cord explosion, here are some steps you can take:

- Check your cords and chargers for damage or wear regularly. If you notice any frayed wires, cracks, or other signs of wear, stop using the cord immediately.
- Always use genuine chargers and cables that are compatible with your device. These products have been tested and approved by the manufacturer, and they have safety features that counterfeit products lack.
- Avoid using third-party chargers or cables, especially those from unknown or untrusted sources. These products may be cheaper, but they can cost you your safety and your device in the long run.
- Don't leave your phone or device unattended while it's charging. If you notice any strange sounds, smells, or other signs of trouble, unplug the cord and seek assistance immediately.
- If you do encounter a problem with a charging cord or charger, contact the manufacturer or authorized repair center for assistance. Do not attempt to repair or modify the product yourself, as this can lead to further damage or injury.

The Moto G5 Plus charge cord explosion serves as a warning to all of us to be vigilant and proactive when it comes to charging our devices. By following these safety tips and using common sense, we can avoid the dangerous danger of a charge cord explosion and enjoy our devices safely and securely.

## Chosen Solution
 Moto G5 plus, phone end of the charge cord overheated, melted cord end and plastic around the charge port. (Using the Motorola turbo charger)
The connector has never seemed to seat properly in the charge port on the phone.  It loses connection of the the cord or phone is jostled even slightly.  Thinking there may be debris in the port I have attempted clean it out gently and with compressed air.  That may have helped some, but only marginally if so.
Now the overheating.
I have connected a new cord, still a tenuous connection, and the phone is charging on turbo.
Any suggestions re: this problem are welcome.
Can the charge port be replaced and how difficult might that be?  I have done screen, batter, etc. on several iPhone models. (using the very helpful guides here at iFixit)

 You can replace the pcb that sells for $2.00 and some change. It comes with the USB port allready soldered on itâ€¦ EnjoyEnjoy.
