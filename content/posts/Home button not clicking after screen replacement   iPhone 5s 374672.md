Is Your iPhone 5S Home Button Broken After Screen Replacement? Find Out How to Fix it Fast!

If you’re one of the many people who has tried to replace the screen on their iPhone 5S, only to find that the home button is now broken, don’t worry. You’re not alone in this. A lot of people have reported that after a screen replacement, their home button stops working. However, before you turn to an expensive repair service or buy an entirely new phone, there are some things you can do to try to fix it yourself.

Here are a few solutions you can try if you’ve found yourself with a faulty home button after replacing your iPhone 5S screen.

1. Check the connections:

It’s quite possible that the issue is with the connections inside the phone rather than the actual home button. You need to carefully open up the iPhone and make sure that all of the internal cables attached to the home button are properly connected. You can use a spudger or a plastic opening tool to gently disconnect and reconnect them.

2. Recalibrate the home button:

One of the quickest fixes is a recalibration of the home button. To do this, you’ll need to navigate to the Accessibility section in your iPhone’s Settings app. Here, look for the AssistiveTouch option and turn it on. Now, a small button should appear on your screen, which you can drag around your screen. Drag it to your home button and keep it there for a few seconds. This should recalibrate the button and bring it back to life.

3. Replace the home button:

If neither of the above methods work, then it’s possible that the home button itself is faulty. In this case, you will need to replace the button. You can buy a replacement from any third-party vendor or online store. However, if you don’t have any experience working with smartphones, or if you’re not confident in your ability to do so, it's best to take your iPhone 5S to an authorized service center to get it fixed.

4. Get professional help:

Finally, if none of these solutions work, or if you’re not comfortable trying them yourself, you can always take your phone to an authorized service center. They’ll be able to quickly identify the problem and fix it for you. It may cost a little bit more, but you’ll have the assurance that your phone is in the hands of professionals, and it will be fixed correctly.

In conclusion, it’s important to know that while screen replacements on iPhones may seem straightforward, they can sometimes lead to unforeseen complications. However, by following the steps above, you can quickly and easily fix your home button and get your iPhone 5S back to its previous working condition.

## Chosen Solution
 I have successfully replaced the screen on my iPhone 5s - everything appears to be working but I have a problem with the Home button.
The button no longer has a click - everything about it still works, including Touch ID, but it just seems over sensitive and it won't click.  This results in Siri activating in error and in other ways is making it hard to use.
I have opened the screen up again and when loose the click returns and everything is fine - the pressure on the back of the button is causing the click to be lost - I can simulate this by pressing the back of the button.
So when fully reassembled, there is clearly too much pressure on the back of the button
Any tips?
Thanks

 Loosen the screws a tad that's holding the button..
Had this problem on a iPhone 5 and it fixed it

 There’s a metal plate under the home button, fastened with two screws. If it’s turned around (180°) the home button won’t click  when a phone is reassembled.
