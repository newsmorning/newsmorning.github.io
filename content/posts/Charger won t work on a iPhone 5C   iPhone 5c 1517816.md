Are you tired of your Charger not working on your iPhone 5C? Find out the surprising reason why!

If you own an iPhone 5C, you may have experienced issues with charging your phone. You may have tried charging your phone with a third-party charger or even the original Apple charger, but it still doesn't work. You may have also encountered the "This accessory may not be supported" error message on your iPhone screen.

The surprising reason why your charger may not work on your iPhone 5C is because of a feature called "Authentication Chip" that was introduced by Apple in 2012. This feature is built into the charging cable and blocks the use of non-certified cables and chargers. The chip communicates with the iPhone to verify that the charging cable is indeed an Apple-certified cable.

This means that if you use any other charging cable that doesn't have the authentication chip, your iPhone may not recognize it, and it will not charge. The same goes for the charger.

So, what can you do about this issue?

Firstly, you can check your charging cable to see if it has the authentication chip. If it doesn't, you may need to replace it with an Apple-certified cable.

Secondly, you can check if your charger has the authentication chip. If it doesn't, you may need to replace it with an Apple-certified charger. 

Thirdly, you can try resetting your iPhone by holding down the home button and the power button at the same time until the Apple logo appears. This may help to reset any settings that could be blocking the charging process.

Lastly, you can contact Apple support for further assistance. They can help you troubleshoot the issue and advise you on the best solution.

In conclusion, the reason why your charger may not be working on your iPhone 5C is because of the authentication chip that blocks non-certified cables and chargers. To avoid this issue, make sure to use an Apple-certified cable and charger. If the issue persists, try resetting your iPhone or contacting Apple support.

## Chosen Solution
 Well basically I went to the shop and brought a 5C. I turned it on for the first time and set it up and everything. Then I noticed my battery was at 21%. So I connected it to the lightning cable then I had a notification 'This accessory will not support your iPhone'. So I tried it the other way round, I still had the notification. So I just thought it will charge later so I left it on overnight. Zzz. Then I checked my battery status: 17%. So I brought another charger and I STILL had that bloody notification. I got a bit p*ssed then. So because I was so bloody angry I didn't bother going to the shop I brought the phone from, I went to the Apple store and asked them to 'try' and charge it. They said it wouldn't charge. So I was a bit more p*ssed now because even the Apple store wouldn't be able to fix a phone their company made.

 Hello Visax Jasmit,
It sounds like your battery is unable to hold a charge .  If you have the tools and know some one willing to lend you their 5c battery, I would suggest swapping the batteries. If you dont have access to tools or a battery, iFixit sells battery replacement kits for your phone. If you buy a new battery and is still does not resolve your current issue, you could return the battery in accordance with iFixits return policies.
Best Wishes!
