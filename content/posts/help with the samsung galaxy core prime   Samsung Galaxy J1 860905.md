If you own a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime or J1, you're probably already enjoying its excellent features such as a fast processor, good camera, and an affordable price tag. However, did you know that there are even more ways to unlock its full potential? Here are the ten surprising tips you should try out right now:

## 1. Use Voice Commands

With the Google Assistant app, you can use voice commands to operate your Samsung Galaxy Core Prime and J1. It's simple and safe to use when driving or when your hands are full. To activate Google Assistant, just say “Okay Google”, and tell it what you want to do.

## 2. Use One-Handed Mode

If your hands are small or you prefer to operate your phone with one hand, you'll love the One-Handed mode feature. To activate it, go to Settings > One-handed mode, and select your preferred size of the screen. Now, you can easily reach all areas of the screen with just one hand.

## 3. Customize Your Widgets

Widgets are a great way to access your apps quickly without opening them from the app drawer. You can customize your widget by pressing and holding the home screen, selecting widgets, and choosing your preferred widget. You can also resize and move it around the home screen.

## 4. Set Up Screen Pinning

Screen pinning is a great way to keep your phone secure and prevent others from accessing your sensitive information. To set it up, go to Settings > Security > Screen pinning, and enable the feature. You can now pin any app to your screen, and the phone will stay locked in that app until you unlock it with your PIN or fingerprint.

## 5. Use Power Saving Modes

If you're out and about, and your battery is running low, don't worry. You can use the Power Saving Modes feature to extend your battery life. Go to Settings > Battery, and select your preferred mode – Ultra Power Saving, Power Saving, or Normal Mode.

## 6. Use Multi-Window Mode

Multi-Window Mode is a great way to multitask on your Samsung Galaxy Core Prime or J1. To activate it, swipe from the right side of the screen, and choose the app you want to open. Now, you can use two apps at the same time, side by side.

## 7. Set Up Hotspot

If you're traveling, and you need to connect to the internet, you can set up a Hotspot on your Samsung Galaxy Core Prime or J1. Go to Settings > Hotspot and Tethering, and enable the feature. You can now share your phone's internet connection with other devices.

## 8. Use Smart Alert

Smart Alert is a great way to stay updated on missed calls and messages. When you pick up your phone, it will vibrate if you have missed calls or messages. To enable Smart Alert, go to Settings > Advanced features, and turn on the feature.

## 9. Use Voice Search

If you're tired of typing, you can use the Voice Search feature to search for anything on your phone or the internet. To activate it, just tap the microphone icon on your keyboard or say "Okay Google" when Google Assistant is active.

## 10. Use Edge Panels

Edge Panels are a quick way to access your favorite apps, contacts, and settings. To activate it, go to Settings > Display > Edge Screen, and choose your preferred Edge Panel. You can also customize it to include more apps or shortcuts.

In conclusion, Samsung Galaxy Core Prime and J1 are excellent smartphones with many features to explore. With these ten tips, you can unlock its full potential and enjoy an even better experience. Try them out today, and experience the difference.
