Title: You Won't Believe What's Hiding in Your Laundry! Shocking Truth About Maytag Bravos Quiet Series 300

Introduction:
Doing laundry is a regular household chore that most of us do without thinking about it much. We trust our washing machines to clean our clothes and keep them smelling fresh. However, a recent study revealed a shocking truth about the Maytag Bravos Quiet Series 300 washer, which might make you cringe next time you do your laundry. 

The Study:
The study was conducted by a third-party testing agency that examined several washing machines, including the Maytag Bravos Quiet Series 300 washer. The study's primary aim was to measure the amount of bacteria and fungal growth present in the washing machines after the cleaning cycles. During the experiment, the testers used standardized protocols to mimic real-life laundry and measure the amount of bacteria and fungi left behind in the washers.

The Findings:
The results of the study were surprising, to say the least. The Maytag Bravos Quiet Series 300 washer was found to harbor a significant amount of bacteria and fungus, including E. coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus. In fact, the number of bacteria per square centimeter was 50 times higher than the amount found on the average toilet seat.

The Cause:
So what's causing all this bacteria and fungi growth in the Maytag Bravos Quiet Series 300 washer? According to the study, it's the design of the washer that's responsible. The washer's low water requirement and the closed design of its drum create a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi to thrive. The study also found that the washer's dispenser drawer and tub were prone to creating a biofilm that bacteria and fungi could adhere to, making it difficult to remove them during cleaning cycles.

The Solution:
If you own a Maytag Bravos Quiet Series 300 washer, there are certain steps you can take to reduce the amount of bacteria and fungi growth in your appliance. Firstly, the study recommends that you regularly clean your washer with bleach or other sanitizing agents. Secondly, you should avoid using too much detergent or fabric softener, as this can create unnecessary residue that could foster bacteria growth. Finally, the study suggests leaving your washer's door open after each wash cycle to allow the drum to dry completely and prevent moisture buildup.

Conclusion:
The Maytag Bravos Quiet Series 300 washer may have revolutionized the way we do our laundry, but it's also hiding a dirty secret. The study's findings highlight the importance of regular maintenance and cleaning of household appliances, even those we never thought could harbor such massive amounts of bacteria and fungi. Hopefully, this article has given you some insights into how you can keep your washing machine clean and your clothes fresh without putting your family's health at risk.

## Chosen Solution
 Recently purchased a gently used Bravo Maytag washer. After the first use, I discovered a lot of lint on the clothing. Where is the lint trap on this washer please and thanks?

 Hereâ€™s my previous answer on this:
OPTIONS
While self-cleaning sounds great, it also means that the lint and hair can be trapped if you don't use enough water to wash them completely out of the machine. It is helpful to run a cleaning cycle every month to flush the lint away and it helps control odors and disinfect your machine.
It is also possible that the filter at your water pump is clogged. When that happens, the wash and rinse water with all that suspended soil and lint drains too slowly and leaves deposits on your clothes.
To clean the filter at your washer's pump, you will need to open the outer housing of your washer. For front load washers, the lower panel will pop off easily and you can access the clean-out filter. For top loading washers, follow the directions in your washer manual to access the water pump. You may find lots of lint, coins, buttons or even a sock that is causing a slow drain and leaving lint on your clothes
If you have your washer connected to a septic tank system, the lint is being washed out of the washer and into your tank. Synthetic fibers don't break down easily and will continue to collect until they cause a problem. There are external lint filters that can be connected to prevent this problem. Remember to clean these regularly to prevent lint from redepositing on clothes.
Adding a fabric softener to the final rinse will help fibers relax and release lint to be washed away. You can use a commercial fabric softener, homemade fabric softener or distilled white vinegar (half a cup in the final rinse).
