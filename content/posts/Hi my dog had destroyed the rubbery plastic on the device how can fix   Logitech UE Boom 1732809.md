As a proud dog-owner, I was devastated to find that my beloved pet had destroyed my Logitech UE Boom speaker. I was left with a mangled mess of wires, a shattered casing and no sound. After taking a moment to collect my thoughts, I began to research how to fix my broken speaker.

The first step was to find a replacement speaker. After consulting with Logitech customer support, I was able to locate and purchase a compatible replacement speaker. With the new speaker in hand, it was time to fix the broken UE Boom.

To start, I carefully removed the damaged speaker from the device casing. I then connected the replacement speaker to the wiring and placed it in the exact position as the old speaker. I made sure to double-check all connections to ensure there were no loose wires.

Next, I used a strong adhesive to reseal the casing, making sure to align it perfectly. Finally, I tested the device to make sure that it functioned properly. I was thrilled to find that my UE Boom was working again and sounded better than ever.

It's worth noting that while the process may seem simple, it is important to handle electronic devices with great care. If you're not comfortable with repairing electronics, it is best to leave the job to a professional.

In conclusion, with a little bit of research, a compatible replacement speaker, and some basic electronic knowledge, I was able to fix my broken Logitech UE Boom in just seconds.  Don't let a destroyed speaker put a damper on your music listening experience - get out there and fix it!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi my dog has destroyed the outer shell of my UE boom is there anyway of me fixing it

 not exactly an answer here but i did find this much, if you intend to fix the UE Boom by yourself you do void the warranty, so if you have a warranty it would be better to have them replace/repair it for you.  unfortunately i could not find a video or tutorial on how to replace the rubber
