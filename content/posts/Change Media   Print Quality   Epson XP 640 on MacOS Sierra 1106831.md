## Chosen Solution
 I have an Epson XP-640 on a MacOS Sierra.  I would like to change the Media & Print Quality to Draft, but that option is grayed-out.  Is there a setting I can change so that I can print in Draft mode and not waste ink?

 Hi,
Check your "Media Type" setting in printer preferences. If a higher quality paper type is selected then the "Draft" option may not be available.
