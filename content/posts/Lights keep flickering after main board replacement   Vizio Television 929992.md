Title: The Surprising Outcome After Replacing the Main Board in Your Vizio TV

Introduction:

Have you ever experienced the frustration of seeing your Vizio TV's lights flicker and wondering whether it's a problem with the TV, the cables, or something else entirely? If you have, you're not alone. Many Vizio TV owners have faced similar issues, and replacing the main board is a common solution. But what happens after you replace the main board? Does the problem go away or is it just the beginning of a new set of problems? In this article, we'll explore the surprising outcome of replacing the main board in your Vizio TV.

Body:

The first thing you need to understand is that the main board is the central processor that controls your Vizio TV's various functions, including the lights. If the main board is defective or malfunctioning, it can cause a variety of problems, including the flickering of lights. Replacing the main board is a common fix, and it usually works well. However, in some cases, the new main board can cause new problems, much to the frustration of the owner.

One issue that sometimes arises after replacing the main board is that the lights may flicker more than before. This can happen due to a glitch in the new board or because the new board is not properly calibrated to the TV's specifications. In such cases, calling a technician is recommended, as they can help diagnose the problem and fix it.

Another problem that can arise after replacing the main board is that the TV may not turn on or turn off spontaneously. In this case, it's likely that the new board is not compatible with the TV or not properly installed. A technician can help troubleshoot the problem and replace the board if needed.

So, what's the surprising outcome of replacing the main board in your Vizio TV? It's this - even if the TV works fine initially, it may start to show problems after a few weeks or months. This is because the new board is not necessarily of the same quality as the original one, and it may not last as long as you hoped it would. In some cases, the new board can cause other components, such as the power supply, to fail, leading to further repairs.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, replacing the main board in your Vizio TV can be a good solution to fix problems like flickering lights. However, it's important to understand that it's not a permanent fix, and you may face other issues down the line. Calling a technician to troubleshoot any problems after the board replacement is recommended. And, of course, it's always best to take good care of your TV to avoid the need for repairs in the first place.

## Chosen Solution
 I have been experiencing some issues with my television. I am a heavy duty hybrid tech so for the most part I am able to test things and figure things out okay lol
For the last month or so my television would not like to turn back on once shut off. If I left it unplugged for a couple of days it would. Now it doesn't like to do that at all. I have tried the power down, and the reset, nothing seems to work.
So I opened up the television and started checking some voltages. The power supply is putting out close to 24 and 12v in some places. I did read on another forum that if the main board is receiving standby power, which it was then the board is bad.
I ordered a main board and before I installed it I tested it again. I then noticed that the main board had burnt around one of the chips. So I replaced it. Waited a half hour then plugged the TV in. As soon as I plugged it in the backlight leds would flash. But only half on the left side. And it would not boot up, or the led power indicator would not light up at all.
I checked voltages at the led board and noticed the left connector had 29 ish volts on pins 1-4. But the right connector had voltage on all of its pins. 10v up to 29v
I'm at a loss on this. Thanks for the assistance.

 1. Unplug the TV from electrical power. Leave it unplugged for about ten minutes.
2. After that time, and while stilled unplugged, press and hold the TV’s main Power On/Off button for about 5 to 10 seconds. Release it.
3. Press and hold each of the remaining buttons on the TV, one at a time, for about five seconds, and then release. DO NOT use the buttons on the remote control - only use the buttons on the TV itself.
4. Press and hold all the buttons on the TV simultaneously (together) for about five seconds, and then release.
5. Plug the TV back in. Power it up normally.
6. The TV should start automatically scanning for active channels from your input signal source. Make sure you have a good signal (antenna or cable or satellite).
If the TV still does not display anything, try the menu button on the TV and see if you can access the menu. If not, try using the remote control’s menu button.
If the TV is still locked and will not respond to any commands from the front panel control buttons or the remote control unit, it is apparently locked in a failure or diagnostic mode, and would probably have to be diagnosed and repaired by a reputable TV repair facility.
Most of the time, shutting down at 5 or 10 minutes, is Power Board Failure
But I suggest  you can check by  technician he better knows rather than online solutions
