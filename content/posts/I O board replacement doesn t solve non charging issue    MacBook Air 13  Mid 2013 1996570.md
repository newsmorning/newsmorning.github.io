Title: The Troublesome Tale of MacBook Air 13's Charging Issue

Subheading: You won't BELIEVE what happened when we replaced the I/O board on our Macbook Air 13!

Have you ever faced a charging issue with your MacBook? Well, we did with our MacBook Air 13. It's frustrating to see your device dying out even when plugged into a power source. We did everything we could, checked the cables and the charging brick, but the issue persisted.

Then we decided to replace the I/O board, thinking that it would solve our problem. We ordered the board from a reputed online store and carefully followed the steps to replace it. Finally, the moment of truth arrived - we plugged in the charger, and voila! It was charging!

We were ecstatic and thought that our problem had been solved, but let's hold that thought. In a few hours, we noticed that the charging had stopped again, and the green light on the charger had turned off. We were dumbfounded! How could this happen after we had replaced the I/O board?

We realized that we needed to dig deeper and find a permanent solution for our charging issue. We researched and found out that we had missed an essential step while replacing the I/O board - resetting the System Management Controller (SMC).

The SMC controls a broad range of functions, including power management, fans, and more. When we replaced the I/O board, the SMC didn't reset to the new hardware, which was causing the issue. We found the solution to reset the SMC by following these steps:

1. Shut down the MacBook Air.
2. Hold down the left-side Shift, Control, and Option keys and the power button simultaneously.
3. Release all keys, then press the power button to turn on the MacBook Air.

Once we followed these steps and reset the SMC, the charging issue was resolved. We were relieved, and the MacBook Air was now charging as it should.

In conclusion, our experience with the MacBook Air 13's charging issue taught us that one shouldn't jump to a conclusion by just replacing the hardware. It's crucial to identify the root cause of the problem and solve it accordingly. Also, always remember to reset the SMC after replacing hardware on MacBooks, as it can save you a lot of time and effort.

So, don't let a recurring issue with your MacBook bring you down. Look for solutions, follow the steps correctly, and you might be surprised to find that the solution was simple all along.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello!
My Mid-2013 MacBook Air stopped charging entirely the other day, while I was using it. (I noticed the light on the MagSafe turn off). I continued using the machine until the battery was nearly dead, assuming I could just continue working and reset the SMC and fix the issue.
Resetting the SMC did nothing. There is absolutely no light on the charger. I’ve tried three different chargers and couldn’t get a light on any one of them. I opened the machine, disconnected the battery and connected each charger to see if I could at least get a fan spin- nothing. Meanwhile, I could reconnect the battery and get it to boot just fine, just no power in, for charge or otherwise.
I assumed the issue must be the I/O DC  board and not the logic board, since the machine functioned normally otherwise. I ordered and installed a new I/O board to no results. Still zero light (orange, green or otherwise) and no fan spin. At this point, the battery seems completely dead, because I can’t get the blinking “CHARGE ME” animation or a fan spin at all.
I removed the logic board to look for corrosion and didn’t see any, but gave the board a good cleaning with isopropyl anyhow. Unfortunately, I’m still not able to get any power to the machine or battery.
Most of the situations I’ve found in the forums that look similar result in the user at least getting a light or a fan spin. I’m hoping that the community may be able to point me in the right direction! Is there any path I can explore further to diagnose where the issue is? I picked up a multimeter with the intention to learn to use it to diagnose issues like these, but I’ll admit that at this point, I have no idea HOW to use it. Although I’m willing to learn!
Thanks so much for your help!

 Let’s start at the charger, Is the a REAL Apple charger or a clone?
Don't Replace Your MacBook Charger With a Cheap KnockoffLacking safety features, cheap MacBook chargers create big sparks
Apple - MagSafe Chargers
If you have a real unit lets check the MagSafe connector interfaces: Apple Portables: Troubleshooting MagSafe adapters a common issue is the middle contact (one wire comm link to the charger) gets damaged


You’ll also what to check the system side as well clean the surfaces with a cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol and a new pink pencil eraser to polish the contacts.
Let’s see if that gets you going. If not, you are likely looking at a problem with the SMC charging logic on the main board.
