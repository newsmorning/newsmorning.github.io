Title: WATCH: Dell Adamo Refuses to Turn on Despite Battery Charge Indicator! What's the Problem?

Introduction:
There are few things more frustrating than trying to turn on your computer and being met with nothing but a black screen. If you are a Dell Adamo laptop user, you may have experienced this exact issue when trying to turn on your laptop despite a full battery charge indicator. In this article, we will explore the potential causes of this problem and offer some solutions to getting your Dell Adamo back up and running.

Possible Causes:
1. Power button malfunction: One of the most likely causes is that something is malfunctioning with your laptop's power button. Check to make sure that the button is not stuck or damaged in any way. If it is, you may need to replace the button or have it repaired by a professional technician.

2. Dead battery: Despite what your battery charge indicator says, it is possible that your battery is completely dead. In this case, you will need to replace the battery to get your computer up and running again.

3. Charging system malfunction: Another possible cause is that there is a problem with your laptop's charging system. Check to make sure that your charging cable is securely plugged into your computer and the wall outlet. If it is, you may need to replace the cable, charging port, or have it repaired by a professional.

4. System board failure: In rare cases, the problem may be caused by a failure in your laptop's system board. This can happen due to a variety of reasons ranging from hardware failures to software issues.

Solutions:
1. Check your power button: If your power button seems to be stuck or damaged, try cleaning it or replacing it altogether.

2. Replace your battery: If your battery is dead, replacing it is the only solution. Make sure to purchase a high-quality replacement battery that is compatible with your Dell Adamo model.

3. Check your charging system: Inspect your charging cable and port for any damage or loose connections. If everything looks good, try using a different charging cable or port to see if that fixes the issue.

4. Seek professional help: If none of these solutions work, it may be time to seek professional help. A certified technician can diagnose the problem and recommend the best course of action.

Conclusion:
If your Dell Adamo is refusing to turn on, there may be several potential causes. From a malfunctioning power button to a dead battery, it is important to explore all the possible causes before seeking professional help. By following the solutions listed above, you can save yourself time and money while getting your laptop back up and running in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 2 month old Adamo 13, won't power up. LED lights up signifying laptop is plugged in, but power light fails to illuminate when pressed. Adamo just won't power on. Any help?

 Plug in something (preferably a external HDD or an external DVD drive), press the power button. If it reacts, it means the GPU or the display could be shot. Also you should try to use the Displayport to DVI or whatever converter it came with to connect it to an external display and see if that works. If it doesn't then there really isn't much to help you with, and either way you'll need to send it in to dell to replace whatever is broken. I'm going to guess its the motherboard though. One way you can get the data out is to get a usata to USB (which I can't find.. so I'm going to say its safe to assume it doesn't exist) and take out the SSD and pull the data out. Otherwise you can't get the data out, i'm afraid. The lesson from this story is to remember to BACK UP!!!! Backing up is extremely important for unfortunate events such as this.
