Look no further than Deep Instinct, the AI security provider that is changing the game with their revolutionary technology.\nDeep Instinct’s AI technology is designed to detect and prevent even the most complex cyber threats in real-time, allowing you to protect your devices and data with ease. But what makes Deep Instinct’s technology so unique?\nFor starters, their AI models are based on a deep learning architecture that is designed to mimic the human brain’s neural networks. This approach ensures that their algorithms are highly accurate and can identify threats that other traditional cybersecurity solutions would miss.\nAnother key feature of Deep Instinct’s technology is its ability to operate offline, meaning that it can detect and prevent threats even without an internet connection. This is a game-changer for businesses that rely on sensitive data and need to maintain secure offline environments.\nBut don’t just take our word for it. Our review for 2023 shows that Deep Instinct’s technology is a top performer when it comes to preventing cyber threats. The platform has consistently received high marks in independent tests, with one study showing that it detected 100% of known and unknown threats.\nWhile Deep Instinct is certainly a standout solution, there are other alternative options worth considering as well. One such option is Cylance, another AI security provider that focuses on preventing attacks before they happen.\nCylance’s technology is similar to Deep Instinct’s in that it is based on a deep learning architecture. The platform also operates offline and has a high accuracy rate in detecting threats.\nAnother option to consider is Darktrace, a UK-based cybersecurity company that uses AI to detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time. Darktrace’s technology is designed to learn and adapt to changing cyber threats, providing ongoing protection against sophisticated attacks.\nOverall, the AI cybersecurity market is rapidly expanding, and solutions like Deep Instinct, Cylance, and Darktrace are at the forefront of this innovation. With their advanced AI algorithms, real-time detection capabilities, and offline operation, these providers are changing the way we approach cybersecurity.\nDon’t wait to protect your devices and data from cyber threats. Consider one of these game-changing AI solutions today and experience the peace of mind that comes with knowing your technology is secure.\nThere are all kinds of cybersecurity tools out there that promise to help organizations deal with today’s cybersecurity challenges. But the problem is that most of these tools are reactionary and rely on signatures or indicators of compromise to detect and respond to threats. That means when it comes to zero-day threats or threats with unrecognized signatures; those tools become ineffective against such attacks because they’re only good at recognizing threats they already know about. That is where deep learning comes into play.\nDeep learning, also known as Deep Neural Networks, is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms. While traditional machine learning algorithms use more straightforward concepts with some limitations, deep learning is designed to imitate how humans think and learn. What makes deep learning so extraordinary is its ability to self-learn as it ingests data and works autonomously to predict, prevent, and detect threats. There are only a few deep learning frameworks globally, and Deep Instinct stands out as the only purpose-built framework for solving cybersecurity challenges.\nDeep Instinct Prevention Platform Review Deep Instinct is a cybersecurity company that applies deep learning to cybersecurity, especially in preventing and detecting malware. Deep Instinct is headquartered in New York City, United States, with Israel and United Kingdom operations. Deep Instinct takes a prevention-first approach to deal with zero-day threats and other modern cybersecurity challenges using its revolutionary deep learning framework. Deep Instinct prevents threats at the endpoint without requiring an agent. It also prevents threats beyond the endpoint by scanning the in-transit files of your applications and workflows, as well as local, private, and public cloud storage and web gateways to prevent the upload or download of malicious files while ensuring the integrity of your environment.\nUnlike other tools that often generate an overwhelming volume of alerts and false positives, the Deep Instinct Prevention Platform fulfills the promise of prevention by providing an improved endpoint protection platform (EPP) efficacy and the lowest false positive rate to stop unknown threats. In addition, deep Instinct prevents threats before execution, unlike most endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions which rely on fundamental machine learning and require the attack to begin executing before it can be detected.\nThe Deep Instinct Prevention Platform is made up of the following key components:\nDeep Instinct for Endpoint: Deep Instinct for Endpoint is a lightweight, agent-based solution that prevents known and unknown malware, including zero-day exploits, ransomware, remote code injection, fileless attacks, script-based attacks, among others. The moment an attacker attempts to infect your endpoint with a malicious payload, Deep Instinct prevents it even before it executes. This helps to improve the effectiveness of your existing security solutions while lowering false positives and your organization’s overall risk.\nIn addition to prevention, Deep Instinct also employs additional dynamic and behavioral analysis layers to detect and automate responses to identified threats. As a result, your security teams will spend less time responding to benign alerts and more time focusing on higher-value priorities.\nDeep Instinct for Endpoint key benefits and capabilities include:\nSupported on Windows, macOS, Android, ChromeOS, and Linux operating systems. Increases the security team’s productivity and efficiency to fight threats. Lowers TCO and increases ROI of your entire security stack. Improves compliance standards for GDPR, PCI, and CCPA. Eliminates frequent cloud checks and agent updates. Maps to MITRE ATT\u0026CK for faster investigations. Guaranteed false positive rate \u003c0.1%. Extremely lightweight agent. Deep Instinct for Cloud: Public cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud, but you are responsible for the protection of what is stored in the cloud. Preventing malicious content from entering your cloud storage is critical to lowering the risk that an infected file could spread malware. Deep Instinct for Cloud contains malicious content in your cloud by scanning files uploading to or downloading from your public or private cloud storage while ensuring the integrity of your cloud deployment.\nDeep Instinct for Cloud key benefits and capabilities include:\nIt prevents malicious files from uploading into public or private cloud storage. Keeps malware-infected files from reaching production systems. Improves existing security solutions by reducing the burden on the endpoint. Deep Instinct for Applications: Deep Instinct for Applications is designed to protect your business-critical applications such as ERP, CRM, and others and prevent the introduction of malware into your production environments. When a file is uploaded through an application, a trigger calls Deep Instinct to scan the file. If the file is deemed malicious, the file is blocked, and according to the policy set by the organization, the file will be deleted or sent to a sandbox. This helps to assure that your applications will not be a source of infection for your end-users or customers.\nKey features and benefits include:\nReduces latency associated with traditional AV file scanning. Provides consistency of security standards across all applications. Scales to the needs of high-volume transaction applications. Deep Instinct for Web Gateways: Deep Instinct for Web Gateways is designed to protect your network and prevent users from accessing malicious content from the internet with greater accuracy. If you are using a signature-based web proxy, for example, to filter traffic, when user requests from the internet hit the web proxy, Deep Instinct deployed with Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) server (a lightweight HTTP-based protocol used to optimize proxy servers) scan files to ensure that malicious content from the internet does not get through.\nImproves end-user experiences by reducing latency associated with legacy AV solutions. Reduces malware at the entry point, reducing the burden on security teams and analysts overwhelmed with alerts. Prevents a more significant number of known and unknown threats at the web gateway. Deep Instinct integrates seamlessly with EDR, SIEM, SOAR, and other tools via REST API, Syslog, or SMTP to improve investigation, remediation, and threat hunting.

As a result, your security teams will spend less time responding to benign alerts and more time focusing on higher-value priorities.</p><p>Deep Instinct for Endpoint key benefits and capabilities include:</p><ul><li>Supported on Windows, macOS, Android, ChromeOS, and Linux operating systems.</li><li>Increases the security team’s productivity and efficiency to fight threats.</li><li>Lowers TCO and increases ROI of your entire security stack.</li><li>Improves compliance standards for GDPR, PCI, and CCPA.</li><li>Eliminates frequent cloud checks and agent updates.</li><li>Maps to MITRE ATT&CK for faster investigations.</li><li>Guaranteed false positive rate &lt;0.1%.</li><li>Extremely lightweight agent.</li></ul><p>Deep Instinct for Cloud: Public cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud, but you are responsible for the protection of what is stored in the cloud. Preventing malicious content from entering your cloud storage is critical to lowering the risk that an infected file could spread malware. Deep Instinct for Cloud contains malicious content in your cloud by scanning files uploading to or downloading from your public or private cloud storage while ensuring the integrity of your cloud deployment.</p><p>Deep Instinct for Cloud key benefits and capabilities include:</p><ul><li>It prevents malicious files from uploading into public or private cloud storage.</li><li>Keeps malware-infected files from reaching production systems.</li><li>Improves existing security solutions by reducing the burden on the endpoint.</li></ul><p>Deep Instinct for Applications: Deep Instinct for Applications is designed to protect your business-critical applications such as ERP, CRM, and others and prevent the introduction of malware into your production environments. When a file is uploaded through an application, a trigger calls Deep Instinct to scan the file. If the file is deemed malicious, the file is blocked, and according to the policy set by the organization, the file will be deleted or sent to a sandbox. This helps to assure that your applications will not be a source of infection for your end-users or customers.</p><p>Key features and benefits include:</p><ul><li>Reduces latency associated with traditional AV file scanning.</li><li>Provides consistency of security standards across all applications.</li><li>Scales to the needs of high-volume transaction applications.</li></ul><p>Deep Instinct for Web Gateways: Deep Instinct for Web Gateways is designed to protect your network and prevent users from accessing malicious content from the internet with greater accuracy.
