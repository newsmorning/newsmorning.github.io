Say Goodbye to Lag Forever: Transform Your Black Desert Online Gaming Experience with These 5 Simple Fixes for High CPU Usage!

Black Desert Online is an exciting and immersive MMORPG that has captivated the hearts of millions of players worldwide. It’s a beautiful game with amazing graphics, excellent character customization, and an engaging storyline. However, some players have experienced lag and high CPU usage while playing the game, which can be frustrating and ruin their experience. If you’re one of these players, don’t worry, because we’ve got 5 simple fixes to help you say goodbye to lag forever and improve your overall gaming experience.

1. Close Unnecessary Applications

One of the main reasons for high CPU usage is having too many applications and programs running in the background of your computer. This can slow down your system and cause lag during gameplay. To fix this, close all unnecessary applications before launching the game. This will free up CPU resources for Black Desert Online and ensure a smoother gameplay experience.

2. Update Drivers and Firmware

Old or outdated drivers and firmware can cause performance issues and CPU usage spikes. To ensure your system is up-to-date, check for updates for your graphics card, sound card, and other important system drivers. You can usually find and download these updates from the manufacturer’s website or through Windows Update.

3. Adjust Graphics Settings

Black Desert Online has beautiful graphics, but they can be resource-intensive. Adjusting the graphics settings can help reduce CPU usage and improve performance. Try lowering the graphics settings to medium or low, and see if this reduces the CPU usage. You can also adjust individual settings, such as shadows and anti-aliasing, to find the best balance between graphics quality and performance.

4. Install a Solid State Drive (SSD)

Installing an SSD can help reduce loading times and improve overall system performance. Since Black Desert Online is a large game with many files, having it installed on an SSD can help reduce CPU usage and improve gameplay. If you’re using a standard hard drive, consider upgrading to an SSD to see an improvement in gaming performance.

5. Clean Your Computer

A cluttered or dusty computer can also cause performance issues and high CPU usage. To fix this, clean your computer and remove any dust or debris that may be clogging the fans or vents. This will improve airflow and allow your computer to cool properly, reducing the chance of overheating and high CPU usage.

In conclusion, Black Desert Online is a fantastic game, but it requires a lot of processing power, and high CPU usage can be frustrating. By following these five simple fixes, you can reduce lag, improve performance, and enjoy the game to its fullest. So, say goodbye to lag forever and enjoy everything Black Desert Online has to offer!

Also, since recent titles are quite hefty in terms of size, take a look at the best browsers for downloading large files on your PC.
 
Coming back to why we are here, if you are playing Black Desert Online and you notice your CPU getting overwhelmed, we’ll show you how to tweak the Black Desert Online settings.
 
## How much RAM does BDO use?
 
We’re just going to say that, your PC needs at least a GeForce GTX 970 or a Radeon RX 480 alongside an Intel Core i5-650 to properly run the game paired with 8 GB of RAM to run on high graphics.
 
As developers mentioned time and time again, for the bare minimum requirements that Black Desert Online has, you need at least 4 GB of RAM.
 
Now, if you want to run it smoothly and not worry about anything, as we said, at least 8 GB of memory will be necessary.
 
Make sure you always check the system requirements for the game you want to purchase and download, just to avoid any issues.
 
If your gaming rig barely qualifies for the minimum set of requirements, we recommend you upgrade your device first.
 
#### Why is my CPU running so high?
 
It can be multiple causes for why this is happening, but the most common one is some software you have open on your device.
 
There are apps or games that require a lot more than your CPU can handle, so that’s when you are going to experience this.
 
Also, make sure you constantly update the drivers, in order to keep everything running fine and smooth, just as it is supposed to. On this matter, software like DriverFix is just what you need to keep all your drivers constantly up to date.
 
## How do I lower my CPU usage BDO?
 
You need to understand something when it comes to Black Desert Online. BDO uses Both CPU and GPU-based 3D rendering and it is a graphics-intensive game.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.
 
Expert tip:

Now, the Pre Remastered BDO was highly optimized for CPU rendering so the lower your graphics settings the higher demand it puts on your CPU.
 
Before we show you what to change in the game itself to lower your CPU’s usage, make sure to close all background processes when playing Black Desert Online.
 
### 1. Disable UI elements
 
It doesn’t sound ideal, but disabling as many UI elements that you’re comfortable parting with, like icons next to the minimap, the quest widgets, icons at the bottom of the screen such as mailbox, and challenges.
 
In truth, all these little extra settings and UI elements present on your screen take up a tiny bit of CPU’s power, and it all adds up.
 
### 2. Disable attack decisions
 
- Enter Settings.
 - Select the Game tab, deactivate Show Attack Decisions Effects, then press the Apply button.

 
As an extra tip, make sure you are comfortable with combat before you deactivate this setting, just so you don’t get overwhelmed by your foes. 
 
### 3. Switch minimap from 2D to 3D
 
Another tip for improving FPS and lowering CPU usage is switching the minimap from 2D to 3D mode or disabling it entirely. 
 
You might not know this, but the 2D minimap actually has the largest impact out of anything on your UI because it’s loading so many icons that are all taking up CPU and ultimately harming performance.
 
Many players also stated that the 2D version of the minimap causes stutters for them, so avoiding it might be recommended.
 
### 4. Tweak Effects Optimization
 
- Access Settings.
 - Select Performance Settings, then click on Optimization.
 - Under Prioritize Effects, move the dial closer to Prioritize Performance.

 
### 5. Change your PC’s performance settings
 
- Press Win + I to access Settings.
 - Select the System tab, then click on Power & Battery.
 - Under Power Mode, select Best performance.

 
And, since you are in this area of the Settings menu, make sure to also deactivate the Battery saver option, just to avoid problems.
 
### How can I make BDO run smoother?
 
As we said, it all comes down to how much stuff you have cluttering your game’s UI, and the graphics settings you are using.
 
Just use the solutions above and you will have better control over Black Desert Online’s CPU usage and FPS.
 
If while playing BDO the power usage is very high, exit the game, let your PC breathe for a second, and refer to this guide. 
 
That being said, remember that if BDO is sometimes stuttering in combat, this is a big game and even gamers with decent rigs will sometimes experience it.
 

 
If the advices above haven't solved your issue, your PC may experience deeper Windows problems. We recommend downloading this PC Repair tool (rated Great on TrustPilot.com) to easily address them. After installation, simply click the Start Scan button and then press on Repair All.
