It was a sunny day, and everything was going well until I accidentally dropped my Ipod Touch 4th generation on the hard concrete floor. I was heartbroken to see a shattered screen, and I knew it was time to replace it.

I immediately ordered a new screen online and watched several YouTube videos on how to replace it. After carefully following the instructions, I had successfully replaced the screen, and the Ipod was looking brand new again. I felt proud of myself and decided to test it out by playing my favorite song.

To my surprise, the sound was distorted and scratchy. I thought it was a minor issue and restarted the Ipod, hoping it would fix the problem. However, the sound only got worse. I tried using different headphones and changed the audio settings, but nothing worked.

I decided to take a closer look at the Ipod's audio jack and realized I had damaged it during the screen replacement process. I felt terrible as I knew I had made a mistake, and there was no way to fix it.

I felt like I had wasted my money and time, and the Ipod was no longer usable. I learned that even the smallest mistake can cause significant damage, and it's always important to be careful when handling electronic devices.

In conclusion, my attempt to replace my Ipod Touch 4th generation screen turned out to be a disaster as I ended up damaging the audio jack. It was a valuable lesson learned as I realized the importance of being careful while handling electronic devices. I hope this article will encourage others to take extra precautions when making any repairs to their electronic devices.

## Chosen Solution
 This is a long one
I've been working on a cracked ipod for over 6 hours now, doing everything and only making it worse. I used the guide here (4g ipod touch), and after taking it apart, i plugged in the new digitzer/lcd, and it worked! Touch worked, power worked, wifi worked, connected to itunes, etc. But then the trouble started. We assembled it back together, and before we put on the adhesive, we tried turning it on again. And this time, nothing happened.
I plugged it in to the computer, and a weird screen showed up. It was all in a shade of white, but the left side was pure white and couldnt see anything. The right side worked, and so did the touch. I replaced this screen with the original cracked screen which worked, except now I had to plug it in to the computer to turn it on, and the power button did nothing. So, I unplugged everything again, put it back in, and it once again only worked when plugged. Also ( not sure if this matters), but it kept working when i unplugged it, only going to sleep after the auto-set time.
So, I did some research to attempt to fix the power button, and I tried restoring the ipod. Aaand it got stuck into the ' connect to itunes' screen. I plugged it in, and this time my computer no longer recognized it. Theres more. Now, my ipod doesnt even turn on when plugged in, not even to the connect screen!
Thanks so much to anyone who read this! Any ideas?

 Have had trouble restarting iPod touch 4's after LCD replacement, sometimes when they've got stuck booting have used this method poster by another user to get them booted -
"If you get problems powering up after screen swap, locate the 3 battery terminal beneath the metal cover, locate the +3.7 volt terminal using a multimeter (from memory its the one on the right as you look at it ) short this terminal briefly to ground ( the metal plate sorounding the home button will do ) then plug into charger and withing seconds you should get your confirmation beep and then screen shows charging, wait a min or so and it will boot up"
don't know if it will fix it but worth a try...

 you've torn the button cable, so you can't reset the device
