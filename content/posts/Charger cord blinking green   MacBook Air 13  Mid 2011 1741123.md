You Won't Believe What This Blinking Green Light on Your MacBook Air 13 Charger Cord Means - Is Your Device at Risk?

If you're a proud owner of a MacBook Air 13, you're likely familiar with the small, green light that flickers on the charger cord. But have you ever wondered what this green light means? Or if it's trying to tell you something important about your device's health? In this article, we'll explore the mysterious blinking green light and its potential risks.

The Green Light on Your MacBook Air 13 Charger Cord

When you connect your MacBook Air 13 to the charger, you'll notice a small green light that starts to blink. This light is part of the device's charging system and indicates that your laptop is charging properly. When the battery is fully charged, the light will stop blinking and remain a constant green color.

Does the Blinking Green Light Mean Your MacBook Air 13 Is at Risk?

While the blinking green light itself doesn't indicate that your MacBook Air 13 is in danger, ignoring it could lead to problems. For example, if your device abruptly stops charging, you may need to troubleshoot the charger or consider replacing it entirely. Some possible causes could include a damaged charger cord or a malfunctioning electrical outlet.

Additionally, if the green light begins to blink rapidly, there may be an issue with the device's battery. A blinking green light can sometimes indicate that your device's battery needs to be replaced or may be overheating. If you're experiencing any unusual behaviors with your MacBook Air 13, it's best to take your device to an authorized Apple repair center to ensure that it's in good working order.

How to Troubleshoot a Blinking Green Light on Your MacBook Air 13 Charger Cord

If you're experiencing issues with your MacBook Air 13 charging system, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem. Start by checking the charger cord and AC adapter for any visible signs of damage or wear. Next, try charging your device using a different outlet or power source to see if the issue persists.

If you've ruled out the charger and electrical outlet as the problem, the issue may be with your MacBook Air 13's battery. Try resetting your device's System Management Controller (SMC) to resolve any issues with the battery. You can find step-by-step instructions for resetting the SMC on Apple's website.

In conclusion, the blinking green light on your MacBook Air 13 charger cord is a necessary component of its charging system. While it doesn't necessarily indicate that there's a problem with your device, ignoring it could lead to issues down the line. As such, it's important to pay attention to any unusual behaviors with your MacBook Air 13 and take it into an authorized Apple repair center if you're experiencing any problems.

## Chosen Solution
 MagSafe charger LED blinks green and won’t charge. We ordered a new (knockoff) charging cable. Tried it cable in different outlets. We installed a new battery. Nothing helped.
I tried the D diagnostics on startup but it seemed to hang up after at about 80% done. It says Pass Number 1, total time testing 49 seconds and it just stays like that. I left it like that for 20 minutes.  And since we put the new battery in  (today) the battery indicator shows an X in it at first, then shows 81%  in red. Here are screenshots from coconutbattery info.

 The first image is telling me the batteries data is not getting to SMC, then the second appears to be working. Is this the same battery?
It also looks like the MagSafe is not connected when you took the snapshot was that correct? If not then we still have a problem with the chargers connection or the charger its self is bad. One of the problems we are now seeing lots of is knockoff chargers flooding the market! These cheap chargers often damage the system.
