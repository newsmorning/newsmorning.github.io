Title: You'll Never Believe These 5 Genius Hacks to Stop Your Ring Doorbell from Constantly Ringing!

If you're a Ring doorbell owner, you already know how convenient it is to have a video doorbell that allows you to see who's at your doorstep from anywhere, at any time. But, if your Ring doorbell is constantly ringing with false notifications, it can quickly become an annoyance. So, how can you stop it? Don't worry; we've got you covered with these 5 genius hacks to stop your Ring doorbell from constantly ringing!

1. Adjust the Motion Settings

One of the most common reasons your Ring doorbell may be constantly ringing is because of its motion detection settings. By default, it's set to detect any motion within its field of view, so it's normal to receive many notifications even for the slightest movement. However, you can adjust the motion detection settings by going to your Ring app and selecting the device, then the gear icon. From there, you can adjust the sensitivity, zone coverage, and even set a schedule for when motion detection is active.

2. Install a Doorbell Blocker

If adjusting the motion settings still isn't enough to stop your Ring doorbell from constantly ringing, you can always install a doorbell blocker. This is a discreet device that goes over your doorbell and prevents it from ringing, ensuring that you won't receive any false notifications. You can easily find doorbell blockers online, and they're relatively cheap and simple to install.

3. Turn Off Motion Detection at Certain Hours

Sometimes, you may not want your Ring doorbell to be active during particular hours, such as when you're at home or sleeping. To turn off motion detection at specific hours, go to the Ring app, select the device, and then the gear icon. You can then create a schedule for when motion detection is inactive for specific time blocks.

4. Adjust the Range

Another way to reduce the number of false notifications is to adjust the range of your Ring doorbell. By reducing the range, you can prevent it from detecting motion from far-off distances, such as cars passing by on the road. You can do this by going to the Ring app, selecting the device, and then the gear icon. From there, you can adjust the range and ensure that it's only detecting motion within the specific area you're interested in.

5. Create Custom Motion Zones

Finally, you can create custom motion zones to better control where your Ring doorbell detects motion. By defining specific areas in which motion detection is active, you can reduce the number of false notifications you receive. To create custom motion zones, go to the Ring app, select the device, and then the gear icon. From there, you can draw custom zones and define the sensitivity for each.

Conclusion

So, there you have it – five genius hacks to stop your Ring doorbell from constantly ringing! While the constant ringing of your Ring doorbell can be annoying, the solutions we've provided can easily help you reduce the number of false notifications you receive, ensuring that you only receive alerts that matter. Whether it's adjusting the motion settings, installing a doorbell blocker, or creating custom motion zones, all of these options are simple, effective, and sure to make your life easier!

When you install a Ring Doorbell, what you expect is a new degree of security. You anticipate better package handling and delivery while secure in the knowledge that your equipment is sound and productive. What you don’t expect is round-the-clock false alarms that keep ringing and frightful awakenings in the wee hours before dawn.
 
The fact is, Ring products are dependable quality devices. However, circumstances don’t always dictate perfection, and if your Ring Doorbell keeps ringing out false alarms, below is a list of five ways to fix the problem.
 
## Check Your Transformer
 
“Upgrade your transformer” is often the default answer when troubleshooting a Ring Doorbell that’s gone rogue. The reality is you should probably check it first. A doorbell transformer will typically be between 12 and 24 volts.
 
You will find the voltage labeled on the outside casing, and if it doesn’t match the voltage requirement for your wired Ring Doorbell—16v—then you may have found your culprit. If it does match, you need to use a voltmeter to check the current on your transformer.
 
If you’re getting nothing on the voltmeter, the problem is coming from somewhere else, possibly a wiring issue. If the volt range is more than 2v lower than the transformer’s capacity, it’s time for a replacement. Transformers often push a higher voltage than listed, and that’s normal.
 
If the voltage is a lot higher—as in more than 5v—you should consider replacing the transformer. You also have the option of installing a resistor to lower the current that’s applied to your doorbell.
 
Note: When dealing with wired devices, transformers, or anything electrical, always remember to shut the power down from the main circuit breaker. An annoying doorbell isn’t worth your life.
 
## Check if the Button is Sticking
 
Sometimes the simplest solution is hiding in plain sight. Occasionally, the Ring Doorbell button may get stuck in place.
 
The first thing you should do is search around the button for obstructions and determine whether it is sticky. The cover plate is detachable as well and, if you can’t find any exterior debris, it should be removed so that you have more access.
 
If you’ve removed the plate, look for any obstructions, and the Ring button is still sticking, your final option is to contact the Ring Support Team here.
 
## Reset Your Ring Doorbell
 
Resetting a Ring Doorbell is simple. However, the reset button is located in different areas depending on what generation or version you have:
 
- Ring Doorbell 2020 Version – reset button is orange and located on the back of the device.Ring Doorbell Pro – reset button is located on the right side of the camera.Ring Doorbell 2, 3, and 3 Plus – reset button is black and is located on the front.

 
Regardless of the device, you have to hold the reset button down for 15 or more seconds to reset it. Once it’s reset, you’ll have to add the device to your app again.
 
A hard reset will clear up any fluctuations or software glitches that will sometimes crop up, especially if your device is older and has been in use for a while.
 
## Thoroughly Check Wiring
 
This should be a priority if your original doorbell was old and replaced with the wired Ring Doorbell. Occasionally, fraying wires, thinning insulation, or fully exposed wires will touch and create problems with the Ring Doorbell.
 
Again, be sure to shut the power off from the main circuit breaker before inspecting the wires. If there’s any sign of fraying, old and discolored insulation around the wires, or exposed metal, either replace the wires or thoroughly wrap them in electrical tape.
 
After you replace or secure the wires with electrical tape, ensure that the wires are as separated as possible before replacing the device. Also, if you have the original chime, there could be two different voltage requirements for the chime and the Ring Doorbell.
 
If that’s the case, you may have to replace the original chime with a Ring Chime Pro or simply use the Ring Doorbell alone in conjunction with the smart app.
 
## Check the Signal Frequency
 
Ring cameras use z-wave technology. Z-wave devices communicate with each other, unlike traditional Wi-Fi, and use 908.4Mhz and 916Mhz frequencies. Fortunately, z-wave isn’t susceptible to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals. However, anything running in the same range as 900Mhz will potentially interfere with your mesh network.
 
RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is a problem for devices that utilize z-wave. You can detect RFI by shifting your devices closer to the mesh hub. If their signal improves, you are probably experiencing interference.
 
Unfortunately, you can’t move your Ring Doorbell closer to a hub, so you’ll have to move the hub closer to the doorbell. Even a neighbor’s device could have an impact on your z-wave network.
 
Move your devices around until you have a secure and stable connection with the z-wave hub. If frequency interference is affecting your Ring Doorbell’s performance, this is the best way to resolve the problem.
 
## Conclusion
 
If you find that your Ring Doorbell won’t stop ringing, don’t worry. One of the five troubleshooting solutions listed above should help finally silence your device!
