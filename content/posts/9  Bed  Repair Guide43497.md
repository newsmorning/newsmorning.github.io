Are you tired of constantly replacing your bed? With just a few tools, some basic knowledge and a bit of patience, you can repair your bed and save thousands of dollars in replacement costs. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to repairing your bed with ease.

Step 1: Identify the Problem

Before you start with any repairs, you need to identify the exact problem with your bed. Common issues include weak or broken slats, wobbly or broken legs, a worn-out or sagging mattress, or loose or broken joints. Once you have identified the issue, move on to the next step.

Step 2: Remove the Mattress

To carry out any repairs safely, it is important to remove the mattress from the bed frame. This will give you the necessary access and space to carry out repairs.

Step 3: Reinforce the Bed Frame

If your bed is wobbly, it is likely that the frame is weak in some areas. You can reinforce the frame by using wooden slats or metal brackets. Simply attach the slats or brackets to the frame using screws, and your bed frame will be stronger and more stable.

Step 4: Strengthen the Joints

If you notice loose or broken joints, you can strengthen them by using wood glue or a specialized joint compound. Apply the glue or compound to the joint and clamp it until it dries completely. This will strengthen the joint and prevent further damage.

Step 5: Replace Broken Slats

If your bed has weak or broken slats, you can easily replace them with new ones. Measure the length and width of the existing slats and cut new ones to size. Simply slide the new slats into place, and your bed will be as good as new.

Step 6: Replace Worn-out Mattress

If your mattress is sagging or worn-out, it may require replacement. A good quality mattress can last up to 10 years, so investing in a new one can make a huge difference to your sleep quality.

Step 7: Replace Damaged Legs

If your bed has wobbly or broken legs, you can replace them with new ones. Measure the length and diameter of the existing legs and purchase new ones from a hardware store. Simply unscrew the old legs and attach the new ones using screws.

Step 8: Tighten Loose Screws

If you notice loose screws, tighten them immediately to prevent further damage. To do this, use a screwdriver and tighten the screws until they are secure.

Step 9: Reassemble the Bed

Once you have carried out all the necessary repairs, you can reassemble your bed. Simply place the mattress back on the frame, and your bed will be as good as new.

In conclusion, repairing your bed is easy and cost-effective. By following the 9-step guide outlined in this article, you can save thousands of dollars in replacement costs, and have a bed that is stronger and more comfortable. So, why wait? Get started today and repair your bed in no time!

Step 1

                  2020 Bed Frame               


 
- 
 - Thread in 4x M6x16 button head screws into the threaded holes in the 2x 173mm 2020 extrusions. Attach the 2x 173mm 2020 extrusion to the 2x 405mm 2020 extrusion and tighten the M6x16mm screws.
 - 
 - Make sure the bed frame is square.
 - 
 - After assembly I found out that there should be 4x internal corners on the bed frame (marked with red arrows). Use 8x M5x8 button head screws and 8x M5 T-nuts to attach them to the bed frame.
 - 
 - The bed mounts come threaded which we don't want. Use a drill with a 4.5mm or 3/16 drill bit to drill out the threads
 - 
 - Attach the 4 bed mounts to the bed frame using 8x M5x8mm button head screws and 4x M5 T-nuts. Each Bed mount should be 62mm from the corner.
 - 
 - Mount the Bed Frame to the Z Bed Carriage Mounts using 4x M5x10mm button head screws and 8x M5 T-nuts. There should be 93mm from Z Bed Carriage Mounts to the corner on all sides of the Bed Frame

Step 2

                  Heated Bed               


 
- 
 - Take the 3mm Heated Bed and the foam insulation. Partially peel the backing paper on one corner of the insulation
 - 
 - Center the foam insulation on the back of the bed. Once it's centered press down on the corner were you peeled the backing paper from.

Step 3

                  Foam Insulation               


 
- 
 - Peel more of the backing paper off but do not let the foam touch the bed yet.
 - 
 - Starting in the corner that is already taped to the bed go in a diagonal direction towards the opposite corner pressing the foam down to the bed
 - 
 - Expose more of the backing paper and repeat until the insulation is taped to the underside of the bed

Step 4

                  Heated Bed Mounting               


 
- 
 - Using the 4x M4x55 countersunk screws, bed springs, and bed adjustment wheels mount the bed to the frame.
 - 
 - The bed wires should face the back panel
 - 
 - With the new bed adjustment wheels they won't work with the metal kit. I made some spacers so you can still use them. You can find them on my Github
 - 
 - Mount the bed frame to the Z brackets with 4x M5x10 button head screws and 4x M5 T-nuts
 - 
 - Feed the bed wires through the hole on the bottom left of the back panel

Step 5

                  Bed Plate               


 
- 
 - Peel the protective film off the bed. It would be wise to use IPA to clean the bed.
 - 
 - Peel the backing paper off the glass bed surface.
 - 
 - Press the glass bed surface onto the heated bed.

Step 6

                  Aligning Z Axis               


 
- 
 - I've always had the theory when tightening the lead screw set screws and the bed carriage isn't parallel to X it'll cause side pull force which will cause the bed to become misaligned when the power is off.
 - 
 - Loosen the bed carriage mounts and the lead screw set screws. I used 2 90° corner brackets. Press the frame so the brackets touch the X carriage. Tighten the M5s for the bed frame brackets
 - 
 - For this part I clamped the bed frame and corner brackets to the X carriage. Spin the lead screws into the coupler so they just kiss the bottom of the coupler. Than tighten the set screws on each coupler equally. If your couplers have 2 set screws that hold the lead screw don't tighten one completely, than the other. Tighten both of them equally.
