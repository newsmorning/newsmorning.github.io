Derivatives are complex financial instruments that are used by traders and financial institutions to manage risk, speculate and profit from fluctuations in the market. In recent years, derivatives have become increasingly popular, with the global market estimated to be worth trillions of dollars. However, like any other financial product, derivatives can be risky, and their complexities can lead to some insane examples. In this article, we will take a look at some of the craziest derivatives examples that you won’t believe.\n1. The Synthetic CDO A synthetic CDO or collateralized debt obligation is a type of derivative that is made up of a pool of financial assets such as bonds, loans, and other types of debt securities. These financial assets are then divided into tranches or slices, each with its own risk profile and return profile.\nIn 2007, the synthetic CDO came under scrutiny after it was revealed that banks had used them to sell off their subprime mortgage risks. The synthetic CDOs were so complex that even the banks that created them had a hard time understanding their risks. And when the subprime mortgage market crashed, the synthetic CDO market crashed with it, leading to huge losses for investors.\n2. The Credit Default Swap A credit default swap or CDS is another type of derivative that is used to protect against the risk of default on a particular investment, such as a bond or a loan. In a CDS, a buyer pays a premium to a seller, who agrees to pay out in the event of a default.\nThe CDS market became infamous after the 2008 financial crisis, with banks and other financial institutions buying and selling them with little regulation. The complexity and lack of transparency in the CDS market led to huge losses for investors when the crisis hit.\n3. The Mortgage-Backed Security A mortgage-backed security or MBS is a type of derivative that is made up of a pool of mortgage loans that are bundled together and sold to investors. The payments on the mortgage loans are used to pay the investors.\nMBSs became infamous during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2008. Banks and other financial institutions packaged up subprime mortgages into MBSs, which were then sold to investors with high ratings, making them seem safer than they actually were. When the subprime market crashed, many of these MBSs turned out to be worthless, leading to huge losses for investors.\n4. The Binary Option A binary option is a type of derivative where the trader bets on whether a specific event will occur or not. For example, a trader may bet that the price of gold will rise above a certain level by a specific date.\nBinary options have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many online trading platforms offering them to retail investors. However, binary options are incredibly risky, with many investors losing their entire investment.\nConclusion Derivatives are complex financial instruments that can be incredibly risky. Many examples of derivatives have turned out to be insane, leading to huge losses for investors. It’s important to approach derivatives with caution and to do your research before investing in them. Be prepared for the risks and don’t get caught up in the hype. Remember, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\nDerivative Examples DerivativesDerivativesDerivatives in finance are financial instruments that derive their value from the value of the underlying asset. The underlying asset can be bonds, stocks, currency, commodities, etc. The four types of derivatives are - Option contracts, Future derivatives contracts, Swaps, Forward derivative contracts. read more are financial instruments like equity and bonds, in the form of a contract that derives its value from the performance and price movement of the underlying entity. This underlying entity could be anything like an asset, index, commodities, currency, or interest rate—each example of the derivative states the topic, the relevant reasons, and additional comments as needed.\nThe following are the most common example –\nForwardsFuturesOptionsOptionsOptions are financial contracts which allow the buyer a right, but not an obligation to execute the contract. The right is to buy or sell an asset on a specific date at a specific price which is predetermined at the contract date.read moreSwapsSwapsSwaps in finance involve a contract between two or more parties that involves exchanging cash flows based on a predetermined notional principal amount, including interest rate swaps, the exchange of floating rate interest with a fixed rate of interest.read more You are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Derivatives Examples (wallstreetmojo.com)\nMost Common Examples of Derivatives Example #1 – Forwards Therefore, the two parties came to an agreement for six months to fix the price of corn per quintal at $10. Even if the rainfall destroys the crops and the prices increase, ABC would be paying only $10 per quintal, and Bruce Corns is also obligated to follow the same terms.\nHowever, if the price of the corn falls in the market – in the case where the rainfall was not as heavy as expected, and the demand has risen, ABC Inc would still be paying $10/ quintal, which may be exorbitant during the time. ABC Inc might have its margins affected too. Bruce Corns would be making clear profits from this forward contract.\nExample #2 – Futures Futures are similar to forwards. The major difference remains as Forward contracts are Over-the-Counter instruments. They can, therefore, be customized. The same contract is traded through the exchange, it becomes a Future contract and is, therefore, an exchange-traded instrument where supervision of an exchange regulator exists.\nThe above example can be a Future contract too. Corn Futures are trading in the market, and with news of heavy rainfall, corn futures with an expiry date of past six months can be purchased by ABC Inc at its current price, which is $40 per contract. ABC buys 10000 such future contracts. If it really rains, the futures contracts for corn become expensive and are trading at $60 per contract. ABC clearly makes a gain of $20000. However, if the rainfall prediction is wrong and the market is the same, with the improved production of corn, there is a huge demand among the customers. The prices gradually tend to decline. The future contract available now is worth $20. ABC Inc, in this case, would then decide to purchase more such contracts to square off any losses arising out of these contracts.The most practical example globally for future contracts is for commodity oil, which is scarce and has a huge demand. They are investing in oilInvesting In OilOil investing is trading or investing in oil sector through various means. Oil market exhibits huge price fluctuations on a daily basis due to which, only highly knowledgeable and experienced players stay for the long run. read more price contracts and, ultimately, gasoline. Example #3 – Options When you are buying a call option – the strike price of the optionStrike Price Of The OptionExercise price or strike price refers to the price at which the underlying stock is purchased or sold by the persons trading in the options of calls \u0026 puts available in the derivative trading. Thus, the exercise price is a term used in the derivative market.read more will be based on the current stock price of the stock in the market. For example, if the share price of a given stock is at $1,500, the strike price above this would be termed as “out of the money,” and the vice-versa would be called “ in-the-moneyIn-the-moneyThe term “in the money” refers to an option that, if exercised, will result in a profit. It varies depending on whether the option is a call or a put. A call option is “in the money” when the strike price of the underlying asset is less than the market price. A put option is “in the money” when the strike price of the underlying asset is more than the market price.read more.”\nIn the case of put options, the opposite holds true for out of the moneyOut Of The Money”Out of the money” is the term used in options trading \u0026 can be described as an option contract that has no intrinsic value if exercised today. In simple terms, such options trade below the value of an underlying asset and therefore, only have time value.read more and in the money options.\nWhen you are purchasing a “ Put option,” you are actually foreseeing conditions where the market or the underlying stock will go down, i.e., you are bearishBearishBearish market refers to an opinion where the stock market is likely to go down or correct shortly. It is predicted in consideration of events that are happening or are bound to happen which would drag down the prices of the stocks in the market.read more over the stock. For example, if you are purchasing a put optionPut OptionPut Option is a financial instrument that gives the buyer the right to sell the option anytime before the date of contract expiration at a pre-specified price called strike price. It protects the underlying asset from any downfall of the underlying asset anticipated.read more for Microsoft Corp with its current market price of $126 per share, you are ultimately being bearish on the stock and expect it to fall up to $120 per share over a period of time, by looking at the current market scenario. So, since you make a purchase of MSFT.O stock at $126, and you see it declining, you can actually sell the option at the same price.\nExample #4 – Swaps Let us consider a vanilla swap where there are two parties involved – where one party pays a flexible interest rate, and the other pays a fixed interest rate.\nThe party with the flexible interest rate believes that the interest rates may go up and take advantage of that situation if it occurs by earning higher interest payments, while the party with the fixed interest rate assumes that the rates may increase and does not want to take any chances for which the rates are fixed.\nSo, for example, there are two parties, let’s say Sara \u0026 Co and Winrar \u0026 Co- involved, who want to enter a one-year interest rate swap with a value of $10 million. Let’s assume the current rate of LIBORLIBORLIBOR Rate (London Interbank Offer) is an estimated rate calculated by averaging out the current interest rate charged by prominent central banks in London as a benchmark rate for financial markets domestically and internationally, where it varies on a day-to-day basis inclined to specific market conditions.read more is 3%. Sara \u0026 Co offers Winra \u0026Co a fixed annual rate of 4% in exchange for LIBOR’s rate plus 1%. If the LIBOR Rate remains 3% at the end of the year, Sara \u0026 Co will pay $400,000, which is 4% of $10 mn.\nIn case LIBOR is 3.5% at the end of the year, Winrar \u0026 Co will have to make a payment of $450,000 (as agreed à 3.5%+1%=4.5% of $10 mn) to Sara \u0026 Co.\nThe value of the swap transaction, in this case, would be $50,000 – which is basically the difference between what is received and what is paid in terms of the interest payments. This is an Interest rate swapInterest Rate SwapAn interest rate swap is a deal between two parties on interest payments. The most common interest rate swap arrangement is when Party A agrees to make payments to Party B on a fixed interest rate, and Party B pays Party A on a floating interest rate.read more and is one of the most widely used derivatives globally.\nConclusion Derivatives are instruments that help you to hedge or arbitrage. However, there can be few risks attached to them, and hence, the user should be careful while creating any strategy. It is based on one or more underlying; however, sometimes, it is impossible to know the real value of these underlying. Their complexity in accounting and handling make them difficult to price. Also, there is a very high potential of financial scams by the use of derivatives, for example, the Ponzi schemeThe Ponzi SchemeA Ponzi scheme is an act of fraud in which potential investors invest with high expected returns and minimum or no expected risk, whereby returns are generally generated for early investors to attract new investors. The amount invested by new investors is used to pay off earlier investors.read more of Bernie Madoff.\nTherefore, the basic method of using Derivatives, which is leverage, should be wisely used as derivatives still continue to remain an exciting yet hideous form of financial instrumentFinancial InstrumentFinancial instruments are certain contracts or documents that act as financial assets such as debentures and bonds, receivables, cash deposits, bank balances, swaps, cap, futures, shares, bills of exchange, forwards, FRA or forward rate agreement, etc. to one organization and as a liability to another organization and are solely taken into use for trading purposes.read more for investment.\nRecommended Articles This has been a guide to Derivatives Examples.

If the LIBOR Rate remains 3% at the end of the year, Sara & Co will pay $400,000, which is 4% of $10 mn.</p><p>In case LIBOR is 3.5% at the end of the year, Winrar & Co will have to make a payment of $450,000 (as agreed à 3.5%+1%=4.5% of $10 mn) to Sara & Co.</p><p>The value of the swap transaction, in this case, would be $50,000 – which is basically the difference between what is received and what is paid in terms of the interest payments. This is an Interest rate swapInterest Rate SwapAn interest rate swap is a deal between two parties on interest payments.
