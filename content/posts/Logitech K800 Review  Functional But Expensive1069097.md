Is the Logitech K800 Worth the Price? Our Honest Review will Shock You!

If you're in the market for a new wireless keyboard, you've probably seen the Logitech K800. With its sleek design and feature-packed body, it's no wonder this keyboard has been making waves. But is it worth the hype and price tag? In this review, we'll be diving deep into the Logitech K800 to help you make an informed decision.

Design and Build Quality

The Logitech K800 boasts a slim and sleek design that looks good on any desk. Its sleek black finish and backlit keys add to its overall aesthetically pleasing appearance. The keyboard feels sturdy and well-built, and the keys are quiet and responsive. The K800 is also wireless and features a USB wireless receiver that can connect to up to six devices.

Comfort and Ergonomics

The K800 is designed to provide comfort during extended use. The keys are soft to the touch and easy to press, and the keyboard is curved slightly to follow the natural contours of your hands. This design makes for a comfortable typing experience, even for long periods. The only downside, however, is that the K800 is not adjustable, so users cannot alter its tilt angle.

Features and Performance

The Logitech K800 boasts several features that make it stand out from the crowd. As previously mentioned, it has backlit keys that are adjustable to three levels of brightness. Additionally, the K800 has a built-in rechargeable battery that can last up to 10 days with the backlight off and up to five days with it on, depending on usage habits. The K800 also uses Logitech's PerfectStroke system, which is designed to make the keys more stable and provide a smoother typing experience.

In terms of performance, the K800 performs well. The wireless connection is strong, and the keys are responsive. The PerfectStroke system does indeed make for a more stable typing experience, which is a plus for anyone who spends a lot of time typing.

Price

The Logitech K800 is not the cheapest keyboard on the market, but it's also not the most expensive. At around $100, it falls somewhere in the mid-range in terms of price. This might be a dealbreaker for some users who are looking for a budget-friendly keyboard. However, considering the K800's features and performance, we believe it's worth the price tag.

Verdict

The Logitech K800 is a well-designed keyboard that performs well and has several useful features. It's comfortable to use, backlit, rechargeable, and wireless. The only downside is that it's not adjustable, but for many users, this may not be an issue. At around $100, it's not the cheapest keyboard on the market, but its features and performance justify the price tag. Overall, we think the Logitech K800 is worth considering if you're in the market for a new wireless keyboard.

We purchased the Logitech K800 so our reviewer could put it to the test. Keep reading for the full product review. 

 

An office keyboard doesn’t need customizable RGB lightning, but in any keyboard, a good backlight of some sort is a necessity. Also useful in an office or on the road is a slim profile and a robust wireless connection. Those are the key selling points of the Logitech K800, a device clearly designed with productivity first and foremost.

 
##   Design: At home in the office  
 

Take one look at the Logitech K800 and your brain practically screams “office keyboard." This isn’t a bad thing though, because that’s exactly the environment this was designed for. It is plain, though not unattractive, particularly in profile,  where its slim, swooping shape gives the keyboard a touch of elegance. 

 

The thin and light nature of this keyboard makes it highly appealing for travel, or as a device that can easily fit within a slide-out keyboard compartment on a desk. 

 
Keycap font and symbol design are as utilitarian as you’d expect, and every corner on the keys, as with the rest of the keyboard, is gently rounded.
 

Keycap font and symbol design are as utilitarian as you’d expect, and every corner on the keys, as with the rest of the keyboard, is gently rounded. Backlighting is a standout feature of the K800. The keyboard features a hand proximity backlight which senses your hands and automatically turns itself on and off to save power.

 

Though the keyboard doesn’t include a volume wheel, it does have dedicated media keys. It also has a dedicated calculator shortcut key that was honestly one of my favorite things about the K800.

 
The thin and light nature of this keyboard makes it highly appealing for travel.
 

Yes, you could get the same thing by programming a macro key on a gaming keyboard, but having it work, out of the box, with any computer with zero effort is definitely useful. Since it is located just above the numpad, it saves you a little bit of time every time you need to use the calculator.

 

The K800 comes with both a wireless dongle and a USB extension cable to allow you to locate the wireless dongle strategically if your computer is somehow inconveniently located. There’s also a micro USB charging cable, though unfortunately, the keyboard won’t use this to communicate with the computer. That isn’t really a problem, but having an optional wired connection would have been nice.

 
##   Performance: A competent keyboard  
 

Though not as responsive as a mechanical keyboard, the K800 delivers a fast and satisfying typing experience. The keys use membrane switches, but they have a decent degree of tactile feedback. Its biggest advantage is how quiet it is, so if silent typing is a necessity, this keyboard is a good pick.

 

The keyboard’s wireless connectivity is strong and introduces no noticeable lag, while In terms of battery life the K800 lasts for 6 hours of continuous use, and 10 days on standby.

 
##   Comfort: Easy on the wrists  
 

Thanks to the built-in wrist rest and gently sloping angled design, the K800 is a fairly comfortable keyboard. The built-in wrist rest also has the advantage of making the K800 easier and more comfortable to use in situations where you might not have access to the wide, flat surfaces required by detachable wrist rests.

 
##   Price: Absurdly expensive  
 

I asked a friend to guess how much the K800 cost. After considering all the features and testing it out, she guessed $50.

 

The MSRP of the K800 is $100, and after my time using this keyboard I agree with my friend's estimate of its actual value. It’s a decent keyboard that offers some significant upgrades over bargain models, but not enough to justify $100.

##   Logitech K800 vs. Corsair K63 Wireless  
 

At roughly the same price point as the Logitech K800 is the Corsair K63 Wireless, and it’s here that we see the issue with the cost of the K800. The Corsair K63 has Cherry MX Red switches which are better to type on and last longer than membrane switches, and overall the K63 is significantly more robust. However, if quiet typing and a numpad are important to you, there is an argument to be made for the K800.
