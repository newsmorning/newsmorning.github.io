Shocking Revelation: HP Pavilion Slimline S3200N Refuses to Start - Troubleshoot the Ultimate Fix!

It’s frustrating and often confounding when your computer just simply refuses to start up. This is the case with the HP Pavilion Slimline S3200N; a computer designed with a “slimline” body that’s perfect for small spaces. If you’ve been having trouble getting your S3200N to turn on or you’re simply curious about how to troubleshoot the issue, you’ve come to the right place!

The issue with an S3200N that refuses to start can be caused by a variety of factors including corrupt operating system files, a defective power supply or motherboard, or an internal cooling fan that’s failed or covered in dust. What follows next will be a simple, yet comprehensive guide that takes you through various steps to troubleshoot the issues and find the ultimate fix!

Here’s how to troubleshoot your HP Pavilion Slimline S3200N:

Step 1: Check the Power Cord

It may seem too simple, but checking the power cord is often the first step to take when your computer fails to start. You might have thought you’ve plugged in the cord correctly, but have you made sure it had clicked and secured in the socket? Verify that the cord is plugged in properly at both ends and check that the socket is working.

Step 2: Check the Power Supply Unit

If the computer still fails to start, you should check the Power Supply Unit (PSU). Check that the switch on the back of the unit itself is on – this should be the same switch that toggles power to the PSU. You can also check the wires that run out of the PSU and into the computer, checking they are properly plugged into their connectors. If the PSU is defective, there is no option but to replace it.

Step 3: Listen for a Post Beep

If the computer powers on but still refuses to start, it may be because there is an internal issue. At this point, you ought to pay close attention to any sounds coming from the computer. Specifically, listen for a “post beep” – one single beep after the computer has passed its test sequence during startup. If you hear this beep, your operating system files may be corrupt and you’ll need to reinstall your operating system. If no beep is heard, there is a hardware problem.

Step 4: Inspect the Internal Cooling Fan

When you turn on your computer, it begins to work automatically. This process also involves the internal cooling fan inside the S3200N that is responsible for ensuring that the computer doesn’t overheat. If the fan has failed or is covered in dust blocking airflow, there is a tendency for the computer to not start. To inspect the fan, carefully remove the computer’s side panel and inspect the fan – Should it be dusty or full of debris, clear it out for optimal performance.

In conclusion, troubleshooting a malfunctioning HP Pavilion Slimline S3200N can be quite frustrating, but by following these steps, it’s likely that you’ll reach a solution. Whether it’s a faulty power cord, defective PSU, corrupt system files, or an internal fan issue, you’ll be sure to find a fix that works. Don’t give up! There is always a solution to every tech problem.


## Chosen Solution
 Press the start button at the top front as normal and absolutely nothing. I’ve checked the power supply via lead to plug at the back of the unit and that’s definitely ok. I’ve been told it’s most likely the’ power stater box’. Help needed, please.

 Hi @usyerlof ,
The PSU in the desktop is an ATX type.
Use the paperclip test to measure all the voltages provided by the PSU.

 the power adapter supplies a fixed voltage as marked on the box. You can measure that with a DVM. Measure both DC & AC for excessive ripple. However, open circuit you should have 0V AC.
When plugged in with the battery inserted, there should be a charging light on.
The charging circuit is internal to the computer and some in the battery.
If the computer does not come on with battery removed and a good adapter plugged in, then it is internal to the computer. Could be a CPU or many other things.
