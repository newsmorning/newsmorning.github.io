If you own a Sony XBR85X900F television, you may be in for a shock when you discover that you urgently need a replacement screen. Despite being a popular model, these televisions suffer from a flaw that could be costly to repair if left unaddressed.

The issue with the Sony XBR85X900F television is related to its screen. Many users have found that the screen begins to develop small, black spots that eventually spread and become more noticeable over time. These spots are often referred to as "dead pixels" and are a clear indication that the screen is faulty and needs to be replaced.

While some users have reported experiencing the issue soon after purchasing the television, for others it has taken a few months or even years to manifest. Regardless of when it appears, the problem cannot be ignored, as it will only worsen over time, making it increasingly difficult to watch your favorite shows and movies.

So, why is this happening? According to experts, the problem is caused by a manufacturing defect in the screen that affects the way the pixels are arranged. Over time, the defective pixels start to fail, causing them to become dead spots on the screen. While this issue is not limited to Sony televisions, the XBR85X900F seems to be particularly susceptible.

If you suspect that your Sony XBR85X900F television is exhibiting signs of dead pixels, there are several ways to confirm this. One way is to look at the screen closely and observe if there are any black spots that are not going away. Another way is to run a dead pixel test online, which will help identify if there are any dead pixels on the screen.

Unfortunately, if your television is experiencing this issue, the only solution is to replace the screen. While this may seem like an expensive and daunting task, it is crucial to address the problem as soon as possible to prevent it from worsening further.

To avoid the issue altogether, it is recommended that you purchase an extended warranty or insurance plan for your television. These options will help cover the cost of any repairs or replacements for a certain period of time, providing you with peace of mind and protection against unexpected expenses.

In conclusion, if you own a Sony XBR85X900F television, it is essential to be aware of the potential issue with dead pixels and take action if necessary. By being vigilant and taking the necessary precautions, you can ensure that your television continues to provide you with the high-quality viewing experience you deserve.

## Chosen Solution
 Is there any way to purchase a replacement screen for a Sony XBR85X900F? My son threw a toy at the screen while playing around and accidentally broke it
.

 With that size of the screen 85” will be pretty impossible to find out. If you get lucky and find on some site it will be very expensive. It’s better to get a new one TV that rather buy a LCD display for that model. Too I believe that you will not find out :/ I checked anyway on some sites which I know and nothing.

 @jwillie ,
The replacement screen is 1/3 the cost of an identical replacement TV
The problem is do you think that you will you be able to get it in an undamaged condition from where it is now and also will you be able to install the new panel without breaking it as it seems to be very thin and it is a big screen?
Also check if your home contents insurance policy covers for accidental breakage. Might be worth a look
