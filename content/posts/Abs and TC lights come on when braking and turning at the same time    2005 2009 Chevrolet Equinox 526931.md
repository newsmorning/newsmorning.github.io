# You Won't Believe What Happened When This Chevy Equinox Braked and Turned - Watch Out for These Abs and Tc Light Warnings!

Driving a car has become an essential part of our daily life. Every time we hit the road, we count on our car's safety features to keep us secure. This story highlights the importance of maintaining your car's Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Traction Control (TC). These two features come in almost every car built in the last decade, and they help prevent accidents in a variety of weather conditions. 

Recently, a driver encountered a terrifying situation while driving his Chevy Equinox. He was traveling through an intersection when he suddenly had to brake and turn to avoid colliding with another vehicle. As he hit the brake, the ABS and TC system warnings appeared on his dashboard, and the car started skidding out of control. The driver says he felt like he had no control over his vehicle, and he was lucky to avoid a collision. 

The ABS and TC are essential safety features for any car. ABS is designed to prevent the wheels from locking up when the brakes are applied suddenly, allowing the car to maintain control and stop effectively. TC, on the other hand, is responsible for providing a better grip on wet, icy or slippery roads. It works by monitoring the wheel that's slipping and applies brakes to it, helping the car maintain its balance. 

When ABS or TC system warnings appear on the dashboard, it usually means there's an issue with either system. Depending on the make and model of your car, the warning light may be in yellow or red. In some cases, the light may blink to indicate a more serious issue. 

If either the ABS or TC warning light illuminates while driving, it's critical to take immediate action. The driver should try to slow down carefully and pull over to the side of the road as soon as possible. Ignoring the warnings can be dangerous, and it can lead to loss of control while driving. It's best to have the car towed to a mechanic, who can check the system's health and diagnose the issue. 

In conclusion, driving safely is essential, and one of the key factors in ensuring safe driving is regularly checking your car's safety features. The ABS and TC system are integral to keeping you secure, especially when driving through slippery or wet roads. Always be attentive to warning lights on your dashboard and take action immediately to avoid any unfortunate incidents. Remember to always drive safely, and you'll be able to enjoy your car trips without any worries.

## Chosen Solution
 In my 2006 Equinox the brake pads and rotors definitely need replaced but also the ABS and TC lights come on when braking while turning unless I break very very slowly. I pull over turn the car off and back on and the lights go off until it happens again. The brake pads and rotors need replaced and because of financial reasons I've had to put this off longer than should be. I'm just wondering if replacing pads and rotors will correct the problem with the anti-lock brake and tread control?

 Had new brake pads put on my 1015 equonix. Now Amy ABS light comes on and off?? What caused this.?

 If your ABS and TC lights are coming on, then the wheel speed sensor is detecting something wrong.  It is possible that badly worn brake rotors could be causing this fault.  When the brakes get replaced, have them check your computer for issues with the brake system.  There should be historical data recorded that will tell them if there is an additional problem.
