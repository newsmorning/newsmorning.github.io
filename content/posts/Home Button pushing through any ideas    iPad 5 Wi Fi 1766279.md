## Chosen Solution
 I dont understand it but lately after the customers take it home their kids push the home bottn out of place any ideas how to not allow this to happen.I have repaired many ipads and have had this issue with  a few replacements.

 Use a stronger adhesive such as Tesa 61395, and apply epoxy around home button bracket to secure it onto the digitizer.

 Your only port of call would to check the bracket. If the home button is broken, it canâ€™t be replaced (without losing Touch ID, of course).
