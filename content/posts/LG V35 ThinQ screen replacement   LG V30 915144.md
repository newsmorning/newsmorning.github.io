## Chosen Solution
 Are the steps to replace the display the same as the V30?

 They are basically the same. Unless you are experienced at replacing screens I would save yourself a lot of trouble and be sure to order the new screen with frame. This will make the repair a lot easier and is easily worth the slightly higher price.
