Title: Shocking Revelation: LG WD80130F Washing Machine Slows Down Spin Cycle â€“ Is Your Clothes at Risk?

Introduction:

In recent years, LG Electronics has become a popular brand for home appliances, especially washing machines. Its models are known for their advanced features, efficiency, and durability. However, a recent finding has raised concerns about one of its popular models, the LG WD80130F washing machine. According to tests and reviews by experts, this model tends to slow down the spin cycle, which can be harmful to the clothes and the machine itself. In this article, we will discuss the issue in detail and provide some tips to avoid potential damage.

Body:

The LG WD80130F washing machine has a reputation for being a high-end model with convenient controls and advanced features. It is designed to handle heavy loads, is energy efficient, and has a fast spin cycle that can dry clothes faster. However, some users have reported that the machine slows down the spin cycle after a few months of use. This can result in clothes coming out of the washer wet, increasing the amount of time required for drying.

Experts suggest that the main cause of the problem is a faulty drum bearing. The drum bearing supports the load and enables the drum to move smoothly during the spin cycle. However, when it wears out, the drum may wobble and produce more noise, which can damage other parts of the machine. Eventually, the machine may slow down the spin cycle or stop working altogether. This can be frustrating for users and can cause potential damage to their clothes as well.

The LG WD80130F washing machine's manual recommends that users perform regular maintenance to prevent such issues. This includes cleaning the machine's lint filter, checking the water inlet hose, and using the recommended detergent and fabric softener. However, even with proper care, some machines may still develop issues due to normal wear and tear. In such cases, it is important to take appropriate action to avoid potential damage.

Conclusion:

The LG WD80130F washing machine is a popular model among users who value convenience, efficiency, and advanced features. However, recent findings suggest that the machine may slow down the spin cycle due to a faulty drum bearing. This can result in wet clothes and potential damage to the machine itself. To avoid such issues, experts recommend regular maintenance and proper care of the machine. If the problem persists, users should seek professional assistance to avoid further damage. With proper care and timely intervention, users can enjoy the benefits of their LG WD80130F washing machine for a long time.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi, my lg wd80130f does not spin fast after completing its wash cycle hence leaving clothes wet,  sometimes it works if i unplug amd start the whole washing cycle again.  When it doesn't spin after cycle, i can hear noise like relay is switching and light sound of motor who is trying to spin, but it can't.
From few days i let it complete its cycle and then i will go into its QC test mode and spin it from there. It works everytime but i want to fix it because if it fails to spin then it won't turn off and on  few occasions (if i leave it anattended) it will keep running for overnight.

The link above is the service manual for you washer. Start on Page 25 for troubleshooting the spin cycle.
Other thoughts: When you do the QC test, I'm assuming this is done with the basket empty. Is the water draining after the wash cycle? If not, look at Page 18 "Drain Trouble" and Page 23 for drain malfunction. Excess weight caused by water drainage issue would affect spin speed.

 Did you find out what the fix was? I am having the same
