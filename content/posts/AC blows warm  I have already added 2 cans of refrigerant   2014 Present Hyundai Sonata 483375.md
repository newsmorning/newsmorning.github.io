# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Added 2 Cans of Refrigerant to My 2014 Hyundai Sonata - The AC Still Blows Warm! Find Out Why and How to Fix It NOW!

Have you ever experienced adding refrigerant to your car's AC system, only to find out that it still blows warm air? I did, and it was frustrating. I have a 2014 Hyundai Sonata, and when the summer heat came around, I noticed that my car's AC wasn't working properly. It was blowing warm air instead of cold, and I knew I had to do something about it.

I did some research and found out that adding refrigerant to my car's AC system might solve the problem. So, I went to an auto parts store and bought two cans of refrigerant. I followed the instructions on the can and added the refrigerant to my car's AC system. I was hopeful that it would work, but unfortunately, it didn't. My car's AC system was still blowing warm air.

After some more research, I found out that there are several reasons why a car's AC system might still blow warm air even after adding refrigerant. Here are some of the most common reasons:

## 1. Leak in the AC System

The most common reason why a car's AC system might still blow warm air is a leak in the system. Refrigerant leaks can occur in several places, such as the compressor, condenser, evaporator, or hoses. If you suspect that your car's AC system has a leak, you should take it to a professional mechanic to get it fixed.

## 2. Broken Compressor

Another reason why a car's AC system might still blow warm air is a broken compressor. The compressor is responsible for compressing the refrigerant and pumping it through the AC system. If the compressor is broken, the refrigerant won't be able to circulate through the system, and the AC system will blow warm air.

## 3. Clogged or Dirty Condenser

The condenser is responsible for releasing the heat that is absorbed by the refrigerant. If the condenser is clogged or dirty, it won't be able to release the heat properly, and the AC system will blow warm air.

## 4. Electrical Issue

Finally, an electrical issue can also cause a car's AC system to blow warm air. If there is a problem with the electrical system that controls the AC system, it won't be able to function properly, and the AC system will blow warm air.

Right after I found out about these common reasons, I went back to the auto parts store, and luckily, the person who attended me was knowledgeable about the matter. He suggested that I try adding an AC sealant to the system, but at that point, I wanted to leave the matter to a professional. 

If you experience the same problem, it is best to take your car to a professional mechanic. They will be able to identify the root cause of the problem and provide you with the best course of action to fix it. In the meantime, reduce your car's AC usage, especially during high-temperature days to prevent other damages to your car's engine.

Don't waste your time and money on DIY fixes that won't work. Take your car to a professional mechanic and get the problem fixed today!

## Chosen Solution
 I have already recharged my 2019 sonata but ac still blows warm. Any suggestions?

 Jowanna McGhee 2019 is a pretty new car and there should not be any issue with the AC. Take it to your dealer and have them check it. It should still be covered under warranty.

 Have a Mechanic filter out the air system and check for leakage. Tools to do such are not commonly owned by individual people as the air flushes have to be airtight or you could possibly damage AC components.
