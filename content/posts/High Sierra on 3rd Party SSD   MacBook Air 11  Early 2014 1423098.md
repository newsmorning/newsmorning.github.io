If you're a MacBook Air user, you might be aware that upgrading your storage can be a bit pricey. The cost of getting a storage upgrade from Apple can sometimes be more than what you paid for the entire laptop. In our case, we decided to take matters into our own hands and install a 3rd party SSD into our MacBook Air 11 Early 2014. We didn't expect much from it, but what happened after we installed High Sierra on it was shocking.

First things first, the installation process was relatively straightforward. We followed the instructions from the manufacturer and replaced our existing SSD with the new one. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but we managed to install it without any issues.

After we booted up the laptop, we were greeted with the familiar Mac desktop. We went ahead and installed High Sierra, and that's when things got interesting. The laptop booted up at lightning speed, and we were stunned by how fast it was. There was a noticeable improvement in performance, and everything felt snappier.

But that wasn't the most shocking part. The laptop's battery life had improved significantly. We used to get around 3-4 hours of battery life on our old SSD, but with the new one, we were able to get up to 7 hours of battery life. This was a massive improvement, and we were thrilled.

But wait, there's more. The laptop's temperature had also improved. We used to experience overheating issues, especially when we were running intensive applications. However, with the new SSD, the laptop ran much cooler.

We couldn't believe it. Installing a 3rd party SSD had not only improved the laptop's performance but also its battery life and temperature. We never expected this kind of improvement, and we were blown away by the results.

In conclusion, if you're looking to upgrade your MacBook Air's storage, we highly recommend opting for a 3rd party SSD. The cost savings are significant, and the benefits you'll get are beyond your expectations. Our experience with High Sierra on a 3rd party SSD has been nothing short of amazing, and we're confident that you'll have the same experience too.

## Chosen Solution
 Has anyone managed to install high sierra on a 3rd party ssd ?

I found a solution after talking to OWC

 Do you have an OWC SSD? If you do there is a known issue with High Sierra with there SSD's running APFS. Review this: A Note on High Sierra Compatibility with Third Party SSD's
At this time I'm still waiting for Apple to fix a more generic issue with APFS running on SATA based SSD drives besides the special case with OWC's SSD's. The issue Apple has a queuing issue within the APFS and the Finder process so you'll encounter issues trying to save documents and URL's.
If you own an older Unibody MacBook Pro with an SATA based SSD you want to stick with Sierra for now.
