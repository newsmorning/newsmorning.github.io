If you're a MacBook Pro user, you know how important it is to keep your device safe from liquid spills. But what happens when the inevitable does occur? Recently, I experienced a liquid spill on my MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017, and the outcome was unbelievable!

It all started when I was working on an important presentation at my home-office desk. I had my coffee mug placed beside my laptop and was really focused on my work. Accidentally, I reached for the mug, and it tipped over right onto my MacBook Pro. 

I immediately grabbed the laptop and tried to mop up the spill with a towel. But it wasn't enough to prevent the liquid from getting into the keyboard. Initially, everything seemed fine, but soon things started to go wrong. 

Firstly, the trackpad stopped responding. As soon as I tried to move my cursor, it wouldn't budge. I knew this wasn't good since the trackpad is an essential part of my workflow. Then, a few of my keyboard keys started malfunctioning. Pressing certain keys resulted in unexpected responses, and others didn't work at all. 

I was in a panic, and I didn't know what to do. But after some research, I found out that liquid spills are a common problem with MacBook Pros, and there are ways to fix them. I decided to give it a try.

I found a local repair shop that could help and took my laptop straight away. After a couple of hours, they called me back and gave me the news that my MacBook Pro was fixed! 

They had opened the laptop up and thoroughly cleaned the liquid damage from the keyboard and trackpad. After that, they tested the laptop to make sure everything was working as it should. To my relief, it was!

I couldn't believe that my MacBook Pro was back to normal. I had resigned myself to the fact that I would have to buy a new one. But thanks to the quick actions of the repair shop, I now have a laptop that works as it did before the spill.

In conclusion, if you ever spill liquid on your MacBook Pro, don't panic. The quicker you take it to a repair shop, the better chance it has of being fixed. But always remember to keep drinks away from your laptop while you're working. You never know when an accident can happen.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi I spilled a little bit of coffee on my laptop 2 months ago and 2 weeks ago my laptop won’t turn on and it was diagnosed that the logic board needs repairing, so is there any way i can bring it back to life without repairing?

 This is one of the best protected machines as far a spill go.  It seldom gets past the cover on the bottom of the keyboard.  I would suspect a shorted keyboard and power on switch.
To test this hypothesis, disconnect the Thunderbolt power and disconnect the battery from the logic board.  Press and hold the power on for ten seconds.  Now hook the battery back up and plug the power back in.  If you get a spontaneous reboot, replace the keyboard.
Here’s how to get to the battery:
MacBook Pro 13" Function Keys Late 2016 Battery Replacement
MacBook Pro 13" Retina (Function Keys, Late 2016-2017) Keyboard

 What likely has happened is the coffee got onto the logic board slowly rotting the connections and shorting out components.
Think of what happens when you have a piece of bread get moldy in one corner before you know it, the mold has found its way across the loaf.
While I’ll say this is a bit dramatic of an example, the coffee spill was festering in the same way.
Sadly, you’ll need to get the logic board repaired or replaced.
