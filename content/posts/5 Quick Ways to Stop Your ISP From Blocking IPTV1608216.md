If you're a fan of IPTV, you may have noticed that your favorite channels suddenly stopped working. Don't worry; it's not a technical glitch or a problem with your device. It turns out that ISPs have blocked access to IPTV services.

Internet service providers (ISPs) have been blocking IPTV services for years. They claim that IPTV services infringe on copyrighted material and result in financial losses for legitimate content providers. However, not all IPTV services are illegal, and the lack of transparency around what is and isn't legal has caused confusion among consumers.

If you're feeling frustrated that your IPTV service has been blocked, don't worry. Here are five tips to help you fight back and regain access to your favorite channels.

## Tip 1: Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a tool that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server. By doing so, a VPN can help you bypass restrictions and censorship imposed by ISPs. When you connect to a VPN, your ISP won't be able to see your online activity, including your IPTV usage.

There are many VPN providers available, so make sure to choose one that offers fast speeds to prevent buffering while streaming your favorite programs. Additionally, check if the VPN service has servers located in the country where your IPTV service is based. This ensures that you can access the service without additional latency caused by long-distance connections.

## Tip 2: Use a DNS service

A Domain Name System (DNS) service can help you unblock IPTV services by bypassing ISP-imposed DNS blocks. DNS services like Cloudflare DNS and Google DNS can redirect your connection to a different IP address, allowing you to access websites and services that have been blocked.

Switching to a DNS service is easy and doesn't require any technical knowledge. You can do this by accessing your network settings and changing your DNS settings to the one you prefer.

## Tip 3: Try a different IPTV service

One of the best ways to avoid ISP restrictions is to switch to an IPTV service that isn't blocked. There are many legitimate IPTV services available, and you can easily find them by doing a quick search online.

Before subscribing to any IPTV service, make sure to do your research and check if they are legal and comply with copyright laws. There are many illegal IPTV services that can put you at risk of legal repercussions, so be careful.

## Tip 4: Use a Dedicated IPTV Box

Using a dedicated IPTV box, such as a MAG box, can help you bypass ISP restrictions. These boxes are designed specifically for IPTV and come with preinstalled software and apps that allow you to stream your favorite programs.

When using a dedicated IPTV box, make sure to keep everything up to date, including the software and apps. This ensures that you're protected against any security vulnerabilities that may be exploited by hackers.

## Tip 5: Contact Your ISP

If everything else fails, contact your ISP and ask them the reason behind the restriction. Sometimes, ISPs do this to prevent cyber attacks or malware infections. If this is the case, your ISP may be able to give you a different solution to the problem.

In some cases, ISPs may be willing to remove the IPTV restrictions upon request. This isn't always the case, but it's worth a try.

Wrapping Up

ISPs are blocking IPTV services, but there are many ways to bypass these restrictions. Use a VPN or DNS service, try a different IPTV service, use a dedicated IPTV box, or contact your ISP for help. It's important to note, however, that not all IPTV services are legal, and using illegal services can put you at risk of legal consequences. Always do your research before subscribing to an IPTV service, and only use legal and reputable options.

ISP (Internet Service Provider) is a company that gives people, and companies access to the internet and other associated services. 
 
## Note that using a smart DNS often works
 
- Some Internet Service Providers block IPTV services, something that leaves users unable to enjoy these services.
 - Fortunately, users do not have to change their ISP when this happens, they can solve this problem on their own.
 - When using IPTV, always make sure that you have installed and updated it correctly to avoid any issues.

 
IPTV (Internet Protocol television) is a service that offers television programming and other visual material using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite instead of cable TV, broadcast TV, or satellite signals. 
 
Generally, ISP blocking IPTV is a common occurrence, but there are ways to stop it from happening. 
 
## Why has my IPTV stopped working?
 
One of the reasons is installation and updating issues. Some IPTV software tools are illegitimate and may cause problems with your device during installation. Furthermore, updates are required if you have the proper IPTV. Your app probably won’t launch if you don’t update it.
 
 
 
Browse the web from multiple devices with increased security protocols.
 
Access content across the globe at the highest speed rate.
 
Connect to thousands of servers for persistent seamless browsing.
 
Crashing issues can also make IPTV stop working. Crashing may be caused by excessive traffic and viewing IPTV for an excessive amount of time. 
 
Not forgetting, internet provider blocking IPTV is a reason your IPTV is not working. Internet providers have the authority to stop some services or terminate your account if you violate their terms of service, which may forbid using IPTV.
 
How can I tell if my ISP is blocking IPTV?
 
For many, ISP blocking IPTV is a problem that is not easily noticed. To tell if ISP is blocking IPTV, follow the listed steps. 
 
- Click the Windows Start button and then select Settings.
 - Select Network & Internet from the Settings menu.
 - Click on VPN on the left-hand side menu and add a VPN connection.
 - navigate to the website using its IP address rather than its URL. You should be able to unblock the site if your ISP just restricted the URL or used DNS filtering, in which case you will be aware that your ISP is restricting your access to the site.

 
Use the ping command (“ping [site name]”) in the Command Prompt to determine a website’s IP address. 
 
If the page loads after entering the website’s address into your browser, your ISP is limiting access to the site for you. 
 
If the page won’t load, the problem lies with the website rather than your IP address.
 
## How do I stop ISP from blocking IPTV?
 
### 1. Use a VPN
 
A great choice in this context is ExpressVPN. It lets you watch IPTV in a secure and private way, which means your internet provider cannot block services or lower your connection speeds based on content. 
 
Moreover, all your internet traffic, including your IPTV streams, proceeds through an encrypted VPN tunnel, and not a single source can see into that tunnel. Thus, no one can see which websites you are browsing or which services you are using. 
 
➡️ Here is a short guide you can follow:
 
- Go to ExpressVPN website and click on the Download button.

 
- Then, double-click and install ExpressVPN on your PC.

 
- After you run the application, click on Choose location.

 
- In Recommended tab, select a country that allows IPTV.

 
- Enjoy IPTV without any blocking.

 
ExpressVPN is a much easier, safer, and faster option for this process, but if you prefer to do this manually, you can always choose and use the manual alternative as well. 
 
####  Use the built-in VPN
 
- Click the Windows Start icon and then select Settings.
 - Select Network & Internet on the Settings menu.
 - On the left-hand side, select VPN.
 - Click Add a VPN connection and then provide the correct login details.
 - Click Save to add the VPN connection.
 - Connect by choosing the connection from the VPN Settings screen.

 
By using a VPN service, you can browse the internet more safely. It allows you to stay anonymous, which means you can avoid possible threats from getting your data and communications by providing a fake IP location. 
 
###  ExpressVPN 
 
  A VPN with high speed that is ultra-secure and easy to use thanks to its various features.  
 
### 2. Use an intelligent DNS
 
- Log into your router Admin Panel. You can find this information in the manual for your modem or router.
 - Enter the admin username and password for your router.
 - Locate the DNS settings and modify them to use the Smart DNS proxy DNS IPs.
 - Save your new settings.
 - Restart your router.

 
### 3. Use a site’s IP address
 
- Click on the Windows Start icon and type Comand Prompt.
 - Select Command Prompt and launch it.
 - Type ping, followed by a space, your website’s address (including the “www.” component), and then add with a space -t. For example, ping www.mywebsite.com -t.

 
### 4. Use a free proxy
 
- Press the Windows + I key combination to launch Windows Settings.
 - Select Network & Internet on the Settings menu.
 - On the left-hand side menu, click on Proxy.
 - Ensure that the toggle for Automatically detect settings is enabled.
 - Turn on the Use a Proxy Server toggle under the Manual Setup section. Windows will check to see if your network already has an automated proxy server established and ready to go. It will identify it for you and urge you to follow its recommendations if it does.
 - Assuming Windows discovers a PAC file, turn on the Use Setup Script switch under the Automatic Proxy Setup.
 - Click Save after entering the script’s address.

 
### 5. Use Tor
 
- Obtain a VPN and install Tor by downloading it from Tor’s official download site. You might choose to join right away or configure it beforehand.
 - Before you launch Tor, connect to your VPN to provide the best level of internet security.
