Title: You Won't Believe the Performance Boost I Got from Switching My MacBook Pro's Logic Board - Find Out Why It's a Game-Changer!

Are you tired of your MacBook Pro running slowly or experiencing constant crashes? Do you find yourself struggling with the performance of your computer even though you've tried everything to optimize it? Well, I have some exciting news for you – switching your MacBook Pro's logic board can be a game-changer!

I recently decided to upgrade my MacBook Pro's logic board, and I couldn't believe the difference it made in terms of performance. Before the upgrade, my computer was slow, unresponsive, and often took several minutes to open applications or complete simple tasks. I knew I needed a solution, but I wasn't sure where to turn. 

After doing some research, I discovered that upgrading my MacBook Pro's logic board could significantly improve its performance. The logic board, also known as the motherboard, is the main circuit board that contains all the critical components of your computer, including the processor, memory, and other essential hardware. 

Without updating your logic board, your computer might not be able to keep up with the latest applications and software updates. This can lead to issues like crashes, freezes, and slow response times. Upgrading your MacBook Pro's logic board can help solve these problems and provide you with the performance boost you need.

The process of upgrading a MacBook Pro's logic board may seem daunting, but it's actually relatively simple. You'll need to purchase a new logic board that's compatible with your computer model and install it yourself or have a professional do it for you. Many computer repair shops offer these services, and you can find information about which logic board is right for your computer online.

Once I upgraded my MacBook Pro's logic board, I noticed a significant improvement in performance. Applications would open almost instantly, and my computer would no longer freeze or crash. The overall speed and responsiveness of my computer had improved drastically, and I could work more efficiently and effectively.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing performance issues with your MacBook Pro, switching your logic board can be a game-changer. It's a relatively simple process that can provide you with the boost you need to make your computer run smoothly and efficiently. So don't wait any longer – upgrade your MacBook Pro's logic board today and experience the difference for yourself!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello guys,
If I need to change my 13" MacBook Pro Early 2011 logic board (it has a i5 2.3 GHz CPU) with a Late 2011 logic board (with a i5 2.8 GHz). Will it work ?
Thanks a ton for any input on that matter! Regards, Guillaume

Hello Dan,
Thanks for your answer !
I want to change my Logic board because my laptop started to have a battery issue.
Let me explain :
When I plug the MagSafe adapter in there is no light (green or orange) on the connector and my mac doesn't detect any current. It's not the "not charging" syndrome displaying in the top right corner of the screen under OS-X.
It's no &&^&^$^ current at all  :/
And as you may now, with these models we just can't plug the MagSafe adapter in and hope it charges even if there is not battery in it at all like with any other laptop ...
So I've swapped the battery with a compatible one (same model same year), I've reset the SMC and all to no avail.
I've discussed the matter with a friend well versed in micro electronics who said to me: "Even if you change the DC board (the little one the mag safe is connected to) it won't change anything it's your motherboard that is too old".
I'm running out of options here, so before ordering a logic board I'll take the one from the similar model MacBook as my wife has and test it.
By the way, I knew there is a core i7 2.7 GHz for that model (my wife has it actually). I was referring to this one in my question but i made a typo error.

 If you review the link I posted in your question these are all compatible with each other. So Yes you could swap out the logic boards.
But the real question here is why are you?
If your board is dead then you may want to jump up to a i7 board Vs such a small improvement with your choices.
Update (06/22/2016)
Before making the jump to a new logic board you may have a bad DC-In Board.
Clearly you're not getting power into the system so that starts at the MagSafe interface often dirt or corrosion can cause the connection to fail. Carefully clean it with a cotton swab with some isopropyl alcohol. Inspect the contacts on both MagSafe connector surfaces are they clean & shiny? With a small screwdriver with the MagSafe adapter unplugged press the pins do they move a little of the adapters MagSafe connector? Looking at the socket of the computer does the plastic insulator look melted or mis-shaped? Replace the MageSafe adapter and/or the DC-In Board.
If your sure the problem is deeper then the problem is indeed the logic board power services. But this might be repairable! While I don't recommend you do this your self you might be able to send your board out to someone who has the skills and parts to repair it. This would be the cheaper direction. Alas, replacing the logic board would be the last option here.
The last point is make sure you stay within your systems series for a replacement logic board as Apple has often altered things between them so the board won't fit or connections won't.
