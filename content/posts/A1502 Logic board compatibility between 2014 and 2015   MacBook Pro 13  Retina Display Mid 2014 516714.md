If you own a 2014 MacBook Pro, you may be wondering whether your machine is still up to par. With the release of the 2015 model, it is understandable to question whether the newer version is a better investment. One topic that has been on the minds of many MacBook Pro owners is whether the A1502 logic board is compatible with the 2015 model.

First, let's dive into what a logic board is and why it is essential to your device's functionality. A logic board, also known as a motherboard, is the essential circuitry that connects all hardware components in your MacBook Pro, including the processor, memory, and storage.

Now, onto the topic at hand: can you upgrade your 2014 MacBook Pro with a 2015 A1502 logic board? The answer is yes and no.

While the logic board physically fits into your MacBook Pro, the 2015 A1502 board has different firmware and may not be compatible with your device. Some 2014 MacBook Pro owners have reported successful upgrades, while others have experienced compatibility issues.

Apple does not officially support upgrading your MacBook Pro's logic board, and if you go through a third-party repair shop, you risk voiding your warranty. However, if you are determined to upgrade, there are a few things you can do to ensure success.

First, do thorough research on the specific logic board you plan to purchase and ensure it is compatible with your MacBook Pro model. If possible, try to find other users who have successfully upgraded their devices and follow their steps carefully.

Lastly, be prepared for the possibility of failure. Upgrading your logic board is a complex process and can result in irreversible damage to your device. If you are not comfortable with the risk or have any doubts, it is best to leave the upgrade to professionals.

In conclusion, while it may be tempting to upgrade to a newer logic board, it is not a simple process, and not always worth the risk. The compatibility between the 2014 and 2015 A1502 logic boards is not guaranteed, and you may end up with a non-functional device. If you are considering upgrading, do your research and proceed with caution.

## Chosen Solution
 So I'm currently shopping for a new logic board for my dead mid-2014 macbook pro 13. I believe its an issue with the power regulation circuit meaning it is something I am not at all able to fix myself, so I figured I should get a new logic board and perhaps do an upgrade in the process. This is the exact one I have: https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbo...
Firstly, can I put an i7 board into the case when it had an i5 in it previously?
When I'm searching ebay for "A1502 logic board i7" I get 2014 and 2015 models. Will a 2015 logic board work with the rest of my 2014 hardware, assuming both are 'A1502'?
Additionally, if I put my old SSD in the new board do I need to do any sort of formatting to get it to run properly or should it just work from the get go?
Thanks!

 Hi
i5 to i7 upgrade is ok. But you must get between 2013-2014 model only. 2015 is completely different. Trackpad cable and LCD are different just to name a few.
As long as you get a 2013-2014 model, the harddrive will work no issues.
The only issue you might run to is if the previous owner did not upgrade to mojave or high seirra on their old hardrive and your harddrive does have one those OS in it. then you might need to reformat your drive. otherwise you will be fine
hope that help
