Shocking Reason Why Your LG Refrigerator Stops Cooling - Find Out Why Unplugging Is The Only Solution!

Are you experiencing problems with your LG refrigerator? Has it stopped cooling? This is a common problem that many LG refrigerator users face. The refrigerator suddenly stops working, and the food inside begins to spoil. This can be frustrating, especially if you rely on your refrigerator to store perishable items like milk, meat, and vegetables.

The good news is that there is a solution to this problem, and it involves unplugging your LG refrigerator. That might sound shocking, but it’s true. Unplugging your refrigerator is the only viable solution that can help you get your refrigerator up and running again.

So, what leads to this problem? Why does your LG refrigerator stop cooling all of a sudden? Here are some potential reasons.

1. Blocked Air Vents

The first reason why your LG refrigerator might stop cooling is due to blocked air vents. If the air vents are clogged, the cold air won’t be able to circulate inside the refrigerator. This will result in a buildup of heat, which will lead to the refrigerator stopping to cool.

To check if your refrigerator’s air vents are blocked, take a look inside the refrigerator and freezer compartments. If you notice that there is a lot of ice buildup, it means that the vents are blocked. You can fix this problem by defrosting your refrigerator.

2. Dirty Condenser Coils

The second reason why your LG refrigerator might stop cooling is due to dirty condenser coils. If the condenser coils are dirty or clogged, they won’t be able to release the heat outside the refrigerator. This will lead to a buildup of heat, which will cause the refrigerator to stop cooling.

To fix this problem, you need to clean your refrigerator’s condenser coils. The coils are usually located on the back of the refrigerator. You can use a vacuum cleaner or a brush to clean the coils.

3. Faulty Thermostat

The third reason why your LG refrigerator might stop cooling is due to a faulty thermostat. The thermostat is responsible for regulating the temperature inside the refrigerator. If it fails, the refrigerator won’t be able to cool properly.

To fix this problem, you need to replace the faulty thermostat. You can contact LG customer service for assistance.

Now that you know the potential reasons why your LG refrigerator might stop cooling suddenly, it’s time to talk about the solution. Unplugging your refrigerator is the only viable solution that can help you get your refrigerator up and running again.

When you unplug your refrigerator, it allows the compressor to cool down. This will help to reset the compressor and all the electronics inside the refrigerator. After a few minutes, you can plug the refrigerator back in, and it should start working properly again.

In conclusion, if you’re experiencing problems with your LG refrigerator, and it has stopped cooling, unplugging your refrigerator is the only viable solution that can help you get your refrigerator up and running again. You now know the potential reasons why your refrigerator might stop cooling, and how to fix them. Make sure to always take care of your LG refrigerator to avoid such issues in the future.

## Chosen Solution
 LG LFX25976ST/02 stopped cooling several months ago.  We unplugged to wait for repair tech.  When we plugged it back in, it started working again.  This happened 3-4 more times within the first 2 weeks, then consistently worked for 3 months.  Now, it seems to have quit for good.  How do I troubleshoot this?

 @stacy0906
start off by checking for any error codes.
3 hours before the error : Press the Ice Plus button and Freezer button simultaneously
3 hours after the error : All errors, except for "Er rt", "Er SS",
"Er IS(except for Icing sensor)", "Er gF", "Er It" error, are displayed.
"Er IS" which is displayed without input of user is the error of Icing Sensor.
Let us know what you get with this.
