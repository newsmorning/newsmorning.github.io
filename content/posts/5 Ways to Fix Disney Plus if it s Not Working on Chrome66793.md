# Is your Disney Plus not working on Chrome? Here are 5 quick fixes you need to know!

Have you recently subscribed to Disney Plus and are excited to watch your favorite Disney movies and TV shows, but are facing a problem with the streaming service not working on Chrome? Don't worry, there are some quick fixes you can try to get Disney Plus up and running on your Chrome browser. Here are 5 quick fixes you need to know!

## Check your internet connection

The first thing you need to do is check your internet connection. If your internet connection is slow or unstable, it can cause Disney Plus to not work properly. Make sure your internet connection is stable and fast enough to support streaming video. You can try resetting your internet connection by turning your Wi-Fi router on and off or connecting your device directly to your modem with an Ethernet cable.

## Clear your browser cache and cookies

Sometimes, an accumulation of cache and cookies in your Chrome browser can cause Disney Plus to not work properly. You can clear your browser cache and cookies by going to the Chrome settings menu and selecting 'Clear browsing data'. Clearing your browsing data can fix the issue and make the streaming service work again.

## Disable Chrome extensions

If you have many extensions installed on your Chrome browser, they may cause Disney Plus to not work properly. Try disabling all Chrome extensions temporarily and see if the issue is resolved. To do this, click on the three dots in the top right corner of your Chrome browser, go to 'More Tools', then 'Extensions' and turn them off.

## Update your Chrome browser

Sometimes, an outdated Chrome browser can cause Disney Plus to not work properly. Make sure you have updated your Chrome browser to the latest version. To check for updates, click on the three dots in the top right corner of your Chrome browser, go to 'Help' and select 'About Google Chrome'. If a new update is available, it will automatically start downloading.

## Disable hardware acceleration

Hardware acceleration is a feature in Chrome that enhances the browser's performance by offloading some of the processing to your computer's graphics card. However, this feature can sometimes cause issues while streaming video. To disable hardware acceleration, go to the Chrome settings menu, select 'Advanced', then 'System', then turn off 'Use hardware acceleration when available'.

In conclusion, if you're facing issues with Disney Plus not working on Chrome, try these five quick fixes to get the streaming service up and running in no time. Checking your internet connection, clearing your browser cache and cookies, disabling Chrome extensions, updating your Chrome browser, and disabling hardware acceleration are some ways to fix the issue. Happy streaming!

The number of Disney Plus videos you can watch these days is as diverse and tempting as it can get, so it’s frustrating when Disney Plus is not working on Chrome.
 
## This could have to do with corrupt browsing data or your VPN
 
- Disney Plus is a popular video streaming platform, but several users reported it's not working on Chrome.
 - The underlying cause here could be a slow Internet connection, compatibility issue, running an outdated version of the OS, and more.
 - To fix things, re-login to your Disney Plus account, clear the browsing data, or switch to a more reliable browser.

 
- Easy migration: use the Opera assistant to transfer exiting data, such as bookmarks, passwords, etc.
 - Optimize resource usage: your RAM memory is used more efficiently than Chrome does
 - Enhanced privacy: free and unlimited VPN integrated
 - No ads: built-in Ad Blocker speeds up loading of pages and protects against data-mining
 - Download Opera

 
Maybe you want to take a trip down memory lane with classic movies or plan to go directly to the newest additions, including the popular Star Wars spin-off or The Mandalorian. No Chrome errors are on your schedule for today, that’s for sure.
 
If you cannot log in using your favorite browser or if Chrome isn’t loading the app at all, we’re here to help you out. We’ve listed a set of troubleshooting tips you can use to resolve this issue.
 
## Why is Disney Plus not working on my browser?
 
If Disney Plus is not working on Chrome, it could have to do with corrupt browsing data, issues with compatibility, incorrect time settings on your device, or using a VPN.
 
Also, make sure to check the network settings and verify that it’s not the slow Internet speed causing the issue. Besides, there’s a chance that Disney Plus servers are facing an outage, and waiting it out is the only solution in this case. 
 
Some of the problems you may face with Disney Plus are listed below:
 
- Disney Plus black screen in Chrome
 - Disney Plus login black screen in Chrome
 - Disney Plus blank screen in Chrome
 - Disney Plus login page not loading in Chrome
 - Disney Plus not working on Chrome cast
 - Disney Plus autoplay not working in Chrome
 - Disney Plus login button not working in Chrome
 - Disney Plus not loading on Chrome

 
Does Disney Plus work with Chrome?
 
Yes, Disney Plus works perfectly on Chrome. Just make sure you are running Chrome 75 or higher on Windows 7 or a later iteration. 
 
Along with it, Disney Plus supports a wide range of browsers, including Opera, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Try them all to find out which one works best for you.
 
## What can I do if Disney Plus is not working on Chrome?
 
We recommend using a browser that loads webpages fast and has built-in features created to help you access content with ease, such as advanced ad blockers and flexible settings.
 
### 1. Watch Disney Plus on a different browser/compatible device
 
If all else fails, remember that you can watch Disney Plus on your PC through a series of browsers. Chrome might be your first-hand choice, yet Internet Explorer and Safari are also compatible web browsers.
 
You may also try Disney Plus on a separate compatible device. Start by logging in with the same details and see if things are any better.
 
Note that other users also reported not being able to stream directly from their browser. They experienced this problem for no more than a few hours though. Then, Disney Plus started working with no action taken on their side.
 
So, this could simply be a problem related to Disney’s servers. As with every new streaming service, there are times when there’s no immediate fix other than waiting. Disney itself has admitted that it hadn’t anticipated the full extent of the app’s popularity before launch.
 
### 2. Check Internet connection
 
If the Disney Plus doesn’t load, first, check if other websites or apps are working normally on Chrome. If not, then it’s most likely an issue with your Internet.
 
###  Opera 
 
  Watch your favorite shows on Disney Plus with this modern and highly customizable browser!  
 
Contact your provider or run an Internet speed test on your own. You can check the Internet speed using a free online website like Ookla. In this case, anything above 5 Mbps should be enough to stream and load the app in the first place. 
 
Also, you may check the DownDetector’s Disney Plus page to find out if others, too, are reporting issues with it.
 
### 3. Sign out of Disney Plus, then sign back in
 
If Chrome just shows a blank page with all the headlines, while the avatar bubble is blank and nothing works, you could sign out of Disney Plus on all devices and sign in again.
 
It takes just a few minutes to perform this task; however, it often solves the problem, especially if you’ve shared your password with others.
 
### 4. Clear Chrome’s cache
 
- Press Ctrl + Shift + Del to open the Clear browsing data window.
 - Click on the Time range dropdown menu, and select All time.
 - Now, tick all three entries here, and then click on Clear data at the bottom.

 
That’s it! After the browsing data is cleared, check if Disney Plus is still not working on Chrome, though that’s rarely the case.
 
### 5. Check for updates
 
- Press Windows + I to launch Settings, and select Windows Update from the left.
 - Next, click on Check for updates on the right.
 - If an update is listed after the scan, click on Download & install.

 
This error can also show up if Windows is outdated. So make sure to install the latest updates, or even better, set Windows to update automatically.
 
That is all you need to do in order to fix things if Disney Plus is not working on Chrome. Also, find out how to stream Disney Plus on Discord without any issues.
