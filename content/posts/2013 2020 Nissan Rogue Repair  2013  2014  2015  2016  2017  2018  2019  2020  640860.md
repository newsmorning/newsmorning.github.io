Title: You Won't Believe the Shocking Truth About 2013-2020 Nissan Rogue Repair: Find Out Now!

Introduction:
The Nissan Rogue is a popular SUV in the United States, but it has been plagued with numerous issues that require repairs. These issues have been reported over the past seven years from 2013 to 2020. Despite the numerous complaints, Nissan has not been proactive in addressing these issues. This article aims to highlight the common problems with the 2013-2020 Nissan Rogue and the repairs needed to keep it on the road. 

Common Issues:
Owners of the 2013-2020 Nissan Rogue have reported several issues that require repairs. One of the most common is the faulty CVT transmission. The Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) in the Rogue tends to fail before the car hits 100,000 miles. This is a major issue that requires a costly repair or replacement of the transmission. Nissan extended the warranty to 84 months or 84,000 miles, but this only covers a fraction of owners who experience transmission failure.

Another issue with the Nissan Rogue is the faulty air conditioning system. Many owners experience a lack of cold air or no air conditioning at all. This is often due to a faulty compressor or refrigerant leaks. In some cases, owners have had to replace the entire air conditioning system, costing thousands of dollars.

Additionally, the Nissan Rogue also has issues with the power steering system. Owners have reported a loud whining noise coming from the power steering pump, which worsens over time. This may be due to air in the system, a worn-out pump, or a leaking hose. Power steering failure can cause the car to be difficult to steer and is a dangerous problem that requires immediate attention.

Repairs Needed:
If you own a 2013-2020 Nissan Rogue, it's essential to stay on top of regular maintenance checks to prevent potential problems. For the faulty CVT transmission, it's important to check the transmission fluid regularly and replace it every 30,000 miles. The air conditioning system needs to be checked annually for leaks and refilled with refrigerant if necessary. If you hear a whining noise coming from the power steering system, take it in for an inspection to identify the cause and repair it before it worsens.

Conclusion:
The 2013-2020 Nissan Rogue is a popular SUV in the United States, but it has been plagued with numerous problems that require repairs. These issues include a faulty CVT transmission, faulty air conditioning system, and power steering system problems. As a Rogue owner, it's essential to stay on top of regular maintenance checks and repair potential issues before they worsen. If you're considering purchasing a Nissan Rogue, be aware of these common problems and factor in potential repairs into your budget.
