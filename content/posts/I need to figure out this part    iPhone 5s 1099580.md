# You won't BELIEVE what's missing from your iPhone 5S! Find out now!

Apple has always been at the forefront of technology, constantly innovating and releasing new products that capture the attention of millions of users worldwide. However, if you're the owner of an iPhone 5S, you might be surprised to learn that there's one critical feature missing - the fingerprint scanner.

That's right, Apple's Touch ID technology, which allows you to unlock your phone using your fingerprint, was first introduced in the iPhone 5S's successor, the iPhone 6. While the omission of this feature may not seem like a big deal, it represents a significant security flaw that could potentially put your personal information at risk.

Without Touch ID, iPhone 5S users are forced to rely solely on a four-digit passcode to protect their devices. This code can be easily guessed or hacked, leaving your device vulnerable to theft or unauthorized access. In fact, studies show that 50% of people use the same four-digit passcode for all of their devices, making it even easier for hackers to gain access to their personal information.

Given the prevalence of cybercrime in today's digital landscape, it's essential to take every precaution possible to safeguard your personal data. That's why Touch ID is such a crucial feature, as it provides an added layer of security that can help protect your information from those who seek to exploit it.

Of course, if you're still using an iPhone 5S, it's not all doom and gloom. There are steps you can take to boost your device's security and protect your personal information. Here are some tips:

1. Use a strong passcode: Instead of a simple four-digit passcode, consider using a longer, more complex code that includes letters, numbers, and special characters. This will make it much harder for hackers to crack your code.

2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication is a security measure that requires a user to provide two forms of identification before accessing their account or device. Enabling this feature on your iPhone 5S can provide an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.

3. Download and use reputable security software: There are many security apps available for download that can help protect your device from malware, viruses, and other cyber threats. Be sure to choose a reputable app that has good reviews and updates regularly.

Conclusion:
While Touch ID may not be available for iPhone 5S users, there are still steps you can take to protect your device and personal information. By using a strong passcode, enabling two-factor authentication, and downloading reputable security software, you can help safeguard your data and stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi. Due to replacement of my iPhone 5s screen I found that there was a small bracket at the 3Â´d screw at the home button assembly. Now the Fingerprint reader does not work - and I forgot to put in this bracket. The former owner says she never did replace the screen ( it was broken when I bought it) and she said the fingerprint reader worked. I think the sensor is an aftermarket one, but can the non working fingerprint reader have something to do with this little bracket?
It is a small bracket under the marked area on the picture. It looks like it connects to the big metal plate to the lcd.
Best regards

 Not sure which bracket you're talking about. Refer to this guide:
iPhone 5s Home Button Replacement
Step 9 shows a small metal retaining clip over the Touch ID cable. If this clip isn't installed it's possible that the cable worked its way loose and is no longer properly connected to the motherboard, which would mean that Touch ID may not work properly.
Step 26 shows the support bracket beneath the home button. If this bracket isn't installed properly then the home button would likely fall into the phone when you pressed it.
So I'll go with the Touch ID cable for starters. Open up the phone and verify that the end connector on the Touch ID cable and the matching connector on the motherboard are not damaged. Reseat it, then install the clip and test. If it's working now, great! You just had a loose and/or misaligned connector. If it's NOT working then you may have damaged the Touch ID cable and/or Home button during the screen replacement process. (This assumes that Touch ID was in fact working before you took it apart. You don't specify whether or not you tested it first.)
