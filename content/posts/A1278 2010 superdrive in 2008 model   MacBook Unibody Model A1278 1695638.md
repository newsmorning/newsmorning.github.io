## Chosen Solution
 I have a MacBook “Core 2 Duo” 13” A1278 Late 2008 here with a completely dead superdrive. It seems to be detected by OS but does not take in DVD’s at all.
The original superdrive has been replaced with a 2010 superdrive. The retailer told me the screw holes are slightly off, but it should be compatible.
Upon mounting I observe that although the superdrive is detected, takes in DVD’s, it decides to eject them after 10 seconds of spinning.
Could the 2010+ superdrive work with a 2008 A1278?
Partnumber original superdrive: 678-1462D
Partnumber new superdrive: 678-0592C

 Try using a known good retail type of disk instead of a possible one that’s just been written to, try several disks.  The drive if it is good should work for you.
