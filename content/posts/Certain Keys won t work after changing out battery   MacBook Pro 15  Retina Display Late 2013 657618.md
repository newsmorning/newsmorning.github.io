Title: Is Your MacBook Pro Holding You Hostage? Find Out Why Certain Keys Won't Work After a Battery Change!

Introduction:

Are you facing issues with your MacBook Pro after a battery change? Do you notice that certain keys don't work? If yes, then you are not alone in this. Many MacBook Pro users face this problem after a battery replacement. It can be very frustrating, especially if you rely on your MacBook for work or personal use. In this article, we will discuss why certain keys won't work after a battery change and what you can do to fix it.

Body:

There are a few reasons why certain keys won't work after a battery change. Let's have a look at them:

1. Resetting PRAM/NVRAM:
Sometimes, after a battery change, the PRAM (Parameter Random Access Memory) or NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory) needs to be reset. These hold information such as speaker volume, screen resolution, and keyboard settings. If they are not reset after a battery replacement, it can cause keyboard issues. To reset PRAM/NVRAM, follow these steps:

- Shut down your MacBook Pro.
- Press the power button and immediately hold down the Command + Option + P + R keys.
- Keep holding them until you hear the startup sound twice.
- Release the keys and let your MacBook Pro boot as normal.

2. Keyboard Flex Cable:
The keyboard flex cable connects the keyboard to the logic board. When you replace the battery, you need to disconnect this cable to remove the old battery. If this cable is damaged during the battery replacement, it can cause certain keys to stop working. To fix this, you need to replace the keyboard flex cable. It's best to take your MacBook Pro to an authorized Apple service provider for this.

3. Keyboard Replacement:
If resetting PRAM/NVRAM and replacing the keyboard flex cable doesn't solve the issue, then you might need to replace your keyboard. Over time, the keys on your keyboard can wear out and stop working. It's especially true if you use your MacBook Pro daily. To replace the keyboard, you need to take your MacBook Pro to an authorized Apple service provider.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, if you are facing issues with your MacBook Pro's keyboard after a battery change, don't worry. There are a few things you can do to fix it. Firstly, try resetting PRAM/NVRAM. If that doesn't work, check the keyboard flex cable for any damages or replace your keyboard. Always take your MacBook Pro to an authorized Apple service provider if you are not sure how to fix it. Don't let your MacBook Pro hold you hostage!

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the battery in my Macbook Pro and now certain keys on the keyboard won’t work such as the “enter” key and the “delete” keys don’t respond. I can use a bluetooth board just fine. Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated.

 When you where lifting the center cells you may have damaged the keyboard ribbon cable.
Lets see what other keys are failing, go to your keyboard preferences and check off show characters & emojis. That will allow you to see the keyboard viewer so you can walk the keys to see which are failing. Post the list here so we can see.
