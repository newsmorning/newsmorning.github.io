Shocking Discovery: LG TV's Screen Flashes Like Lightning When Plugged In - Is It a Safety Hazard?

Overview
The recent discovery about certain models of LG TV exhibiting flashes of bright lightening-like effects has caused significant concern among the television users. The customers have reported to have witnessed this sudden screen flashing phenomenon while connecting the television to power. While the company is yet to provide any conclusive answers, this hot topic raises concerns from a safety perspective. Here’s a closer look at the issue.

What is happening?
As per the reports, certain LG TV models exhibit sudden screen flashing when they are plugged in. It appears like a flash of bright lightening that lasts for a couple of seconds. The issue has been claimed by the users to happen randomly, with no prior warning or indication. It occurs when the television is first plugged in and then powered on.

Is it a safety concern?
The immediate cause of concern around the issue is the safety aspect of such screen flashing. As per a statement by an LG spokesperson, this pulsating effect is a normal part of LG’s start-up process that enhances its picture quality. However, there is still an air of doubt around the nature of the flashes, and it’s essential to scrutinize the matter further. Although the company is yet to acknowledge the safety concerns, numerous customers have reported concerns about the emitted light from the TV. Some have expressed the fear of seizures, especially for individuals suffering from photosensitivity.

What are the impacts of sudden flashes?
The issue with the sudden screen flashing is two-fold. Firstly, the flash is bright enough to cause discomfort and potential damages to the eyes. Secondly, frequent or prolonged flashing can trigger migraines and headaches, especially in individuals with a history of migraines. A study by the American Academy of Neurology suggests that repetitive light flashes cause migraines in approximately 90% of people with migraines. This shows the severity of the issue and the need for immediate attention.

What to do if your LG TV exhibits the issue?
If your LG TV exhibits sudden screen flashing, it’s essential to exercise caution. It’s advisable to step away from the television and not watch it from close proximity. You can avoid connecting the TV to powered sources until you receive a conclusive response from LG about the issue. It’s also suggested to seek medical advice if you experience any discomfort or symptoms related to the effects of the sudden flashing.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the issue of LG TV’s screen flashing like lightning has raised significant concerns from a safety perspective. Although LG has provided some explanation regarding the flashing, the lack of clarity around the issue continues to raise valid concerns from users. It’s imperative for the company to investigate the matter further and provide a specific course of action that ensures the safety of the users. Until then, users must act cautiously and take the necessary precautions around the issue.

## Chosen Solution
 I'm hoping that someone might be able to help me determine what parts I would need to purchase in order to fix my LG 55UH6030-UC television, if it's able to be fixed.
Here is the issue: I went to turn on the TV yesterday, and the screen started flickering quickly. I could see the LG logo slightly, but that was it. It just continued with a quick flashing. I unplugged the TV from the outlet and let it sit without power for hours while I was at work. When I got home, I tried resetting the TV by holding down the power button on the TV for about a minute while it was unplugged. When I plugged it back in, the screen immediately continued with the quick flashing. I didn't even push the power button, it just started happening the moment I plugged it in. Prior to this, I have not had any issues with the TV whatsoever, it has worked perfectly. I haven't experienced any power outages, and my TV is plugged into a surge protector, so I'm not sure what caused this to happen.
I'm thinking that it must be the power supply/LED driver board since the screen starts flashing as soon as it is plugged in. Has anyone seen this happen before, or possibly know what the issue might be? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.

 travot3k sure, it could be the main board, the power board or worst case scenario, even the panel. I just have a hunch here. It is a LG TV and they are really having issues with bad backlight strips. A failing backlight could also appear as if the TV is tuning off and on. Disconnect the backlight LED from the power board. Measure the VDC on those connectors with the TV on. See if the voltage is stable and steady. With a  TV that size I'd expect around 3-400VDC. Let us know what you find out.
Of course you can also measure the voltages on the connector from the power board to the main board. Use the legend on the board as your guide about the voltages. Post some really good pictures of your board with your QUESTION so that we can see what you see. Adding images to an existing question
