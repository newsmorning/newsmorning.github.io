2. Open the app of your choice and select the option to customize your home button.

3. Choose the action you want your home button to perform. You can select from a list of pre-set actions or create your own custom action.

4. Once you have chosen the action, save it and exit the app. Your home button is now customized!

In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge home button hack is revolutionary and a game-changer in terms of convenience and efficiency.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I was before a technician in smartphone fixes but I'm now done with this.
A friend asked me to replace her broken Samsung S6 Edge screen. Her original screen is white but she want to change for a gold one.
I  couldn't find any information on the internet about the fingerprint sensor. Does it still work after a replacement ? Because I know it's not the case for Apple branded phones.
If someone has already experienced a home button with fingerprint sensor swap on a Samsung phone, please let me know if it still worked after you were done with your job.
Thanks :)

 I successfully swapped out the home button assembly on a friends S6 Edge, worked just as well as it did before (Same Situation, wanted white screen)

 It can work, just go ahead to replace it.

 Unfortunately mine didnt work :(
S7 screen replaced with new homebutton - now fingerprint doesnt work.
Any tips?
