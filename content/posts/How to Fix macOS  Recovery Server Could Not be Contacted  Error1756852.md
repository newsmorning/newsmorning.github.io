What Are the Causes of the "Recovery Server Could Not Be Contacted" Error?

The "Recovery Server Could Not Be Contacted" error usually occurs when the Mac is unable to connect to Apple's servers. The causes of this error may include:

4. An outdated operating system: If the Mac's operating system is too old, the Error may occur. 

How to Fix the "Recovery Server Could Not Be Contacted" Error?

1. Check Internet Connection

The first step to resolving the "Recovery Server Could Not Be Contacted" error is to check your internet connection. Make sure that your Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection is strong and stable. Ensure that your Mac is connected to the internet before trying to reinstall macOS via the Recovery Server.

2. Check DNS Settings

If your internet connection is stable, check your DNS settings. DNS settings translate domain names into IP addresses, which helps your Mac connect to the internet. If your Mac cannot resolve domain names, you will be unable to connect to Apple's servers. You can resolve this error by changing your DNS settings. Go to System Preferences > Network > Wi-Fi > Advanced > DNS. Add Google's public DNS 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, and try reinstalling macOS via the Recovery Server.

3. Reset Network Configurations

If your DNS settings are fine and the error persists, try resetting your network configurations. Go to System Preferences > Network > Wi-Fi > Advanced > TCP/IP. Click on 'Renew DHCP lease', and update the configurations. Try reinstalling macOS via Recovery Server to see if the error is resolved.

4. Disable Firewall

Sometimes, firewalls block communication between computers and servers. If you are certain that your internet connection is stable, try disabling your firewall temporarily. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall. Disable the firewall and try reinstalling macOS via Recovery Server to see if the error is resolved.

5. Update your OS

If your Mac's operating system is too old, the "Recovery Server Could Not Be Contacted" error may occur. Ensure that your Mac's operating system is up-to-date by going to the App Store > Updates. Install any available updates for your OS and try reinstalling macOS via Recovery Server.
