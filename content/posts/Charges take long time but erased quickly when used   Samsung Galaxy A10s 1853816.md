 How to solve the problem of charge or the thing I written it in the title
Please help

 Mame a slow charge but quick discharge would lead me to start with a replacement battery. Of course make sure you have a good Charger and charging cable. Also check the charging port for debris, corrosion. If that still won't wirk replacing the daughterboard would be next on my list.
