Have you ever experienced problems with its home button? If the answer is yes, you’re not alone. The iPhone 5S is known for having issues with its home button, with many users reporting that the button becomes unresponsive, overly sensitive, or stops working altogether.\nIn an attempt to fix this issue, many users have turned to replacing their iPhone 5S home button. While some have reported success, others have faced unexpected results, including the button still not working after replacement.\nSo what’s going on? Why are some iPhone 5S home buttons resistant to repair? Let’s take a closer look.\nOne of the primary reasons why replacing an iPhone 5S home button may not fix the issue is that the problem isn’t with the button itself but with the underlying components that control it. The home button relies on a small circuit board that can become damaged or worn over time. Replacing the button alone may not address the root cause of the problem, leaving the button still unresponsive.\nAnother potential issue with replacing the home button on an iPhone 5S is that the device’s Touch ID feature may not work correctly. Touch ID is a fingerprint sensor located inside the home button that allows users to unlock their iPhone and make purchases with Apple Pay. When the home button is replaced, the Touch ID sensor may no longer function correctly, leaving users unable to use these features.\nAdditionally, replacing the home button on an iPhone 5S requires a skilled technician with specialized tools. If the replacement isn’t done correctly, it can cause further damage to the device, leading to even more problems than before.\nSo what should you do if your iPhone 5S home button isn’t working correctly? Your best bet is to take it to a reputable repair shop or an Apple Store. They can diagnose the issue and offer a proper solution for fixing it.\nIn conclusion, replacing an iPhone 5S home button may seem like a simple solution to a frustrating problem. However, it’s essential to understand that there can be underlying issues that cause the button to malfunction. In some cases, replacing the button could make matters worse, leaving you with a device that still doesn’t work correctly. If you’re experiencing issues with your iPhone 5S home button, seek professional help to ensure a successful repair.\nChosen Solution Hello, I have a iphone 5s whos home button has stopped working, i have got 2 replacements and tried both of them and neither have worked. my next idea would be to change the charging port, but im not sure if that would do the job so asking you guys if you have any ideas. Thank you\nIs it the actual button? Or the ribbon? If its the ribbon, you may as well get a whole new phone as that is non fixable unless you want to buy a new logic board to have installed which is about the price of a new one.\nAftermarket homebuttons will work, however it will disable Touch ID functionality.\nThis is more than likely the charging port flex connector to the home button replace that and should work no problem.\nif you have the orginal home button on there its probably the connector, circuit board, or software glitch. If you have a aftermarket home button it will not work. It has to be an Apple home button which you could get a Apple but they have to install it. Or just disable the home button and use the accessibility buttons on the screen as your home button.\n","wordCount":"651","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Teresa Jones"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-not-working-even-after-replacement-iphone-5s-1242517/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe what happened after replacing my iPhone 5S home button - it STILL doesn't work!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 10, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;651 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Teresa Jones</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>+++
