## Chosen Solution
 I have a Razor Scooter e-200 model, it's all rusted up and needs attention.
Is there a parts list available ?
How would I go about obtaining the cost of a NEW scooter ?

 Hi oldasdirt73 there are parts available here http://www.ereplacementparts.com/razor-e... this is the place where you find all the parts you need for anything motorized and the only place I know that sells many parts.  But they don't have manuals sadly but that can be found here http://www.razor.com/customer-care/ this should help with the most important questions.
There is also this link which gives some guides for your scooter.
