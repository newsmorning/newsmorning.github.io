# Unlock the Secrets of Data Retrieval on Your Samsung Galaxy and Never Lose Important Info Again!

Losing important data on your Samsung Galaxy can be frustrating, especially when you don't have a backup. Whether it's your saved contacts, text messages, photos, videos, or documents, losing such information can be disastrous. 

However, with the right tools and techniques, you can retrieve your lost data and have them back on your device. In this article, we'll delve into the secrets of data retrieval on your Samsung Galaxy and help you never to lose important info again.

## Tip #1: Enable Automatic Backups

One of the easiest ways to avoid losing data is by enabling automatic backups on your Samsung Galaxy. The device comes with a built-in feature that automatically backs up your data to your Google account. By default, this feature is set to ON, but you can check it by following these steps:

- Go to Settings, then scroll down to Accounts and Backup.
- Tap on Backup and Restore, and make sure the switch next to "Back up my data" is turned on.

You should also check the backup frequency and the types of data backed up. By default, the device backs up your apps, device settings, and Wi-Fi passwords daily. However, you can customize the backup frequency and include more data such as SMS, Call logs, and app data.

## Tip #2: Use Samsung Cloud

If you prefer to have more control over your backups, you can use Samsung Cloud, a cloud storage service exclusive to Samsung Galaxy devices. With Samsung Cloud, you can store your data, including photos, videos, documents, and settings, securely in the cloud and access them from anywhere, anytime.

To use Samsung Cloud, follow these steps:

- Go to Settings, then scroll down to Cloud and Accounts.
- Tap on Samsung Cloud, and sign in using your Samsung account.
- Select the data you want to back up, or enable automatic backup.

You can also check your Samsung Cloud storage usage and manage your data from the same menu.

## Tip #3: Use Third-Party Data Recovery Apps

If you've already lost your data and don't have a backup, don't panic. There are several third-party data recovery apps that can help you retrieve your lost files. These apps work by scanning your device's storage for deleted or lost files and restoring them to their original state.

To use a data recovery app, follow these steps:

- Download and install a trusted data recovery app such as DiskDigger or EaseUS MobiSaver from the Google Play Store.
- Launch the app, grant it the necessary permissions, and select the storage location you want to scan.
- Wait while the app scans your device for lost files, and select the ones you want to recover.

Keep in mind that not all data recovery apps are reliable, and some may even harm your device. Therefore, it's important to read reviews and choose a trusted app.

## Tip #4: Contact Samsung Support

If none of the above tips help you retrieve your lost data, you can contact Samsung Support for assistance. Samsung has a team of experts who can help you diagnose and fix issues with your device, including data loss. However, this service may come at a cost, depending on your device's warranty status.

To contact Samsung Support, follow these steps:

- Go to Settings, then scroll down to About Phone.
- Tap on Software Information, and select the option to "Contact Us."
- Follow the prompts to provide your device and contact information, and describe your issue.

In conclusion, losing important data on your Samsung Galaxy can be frustrating, but it doesn't have to be permanent. By following these tips, you can unlock the secrets of data retrieval on your device and never lose important info again. Remember to enable automatic backups, use Samsung Cloud, use third-party data recovery apps, and contact Samsung Support if necessary.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Samsung Galaxy with a broken screen, I can' get access to it, i would like to retrieve the data stored in it.

 You fix the phone (get the screen replaced) then you can get the data out. This is how 'data recovery' has always been done on mobile  phones.

 Plug the usb into a laptop or computer.  Your files on the Samsung should appear as another drive on your pc.  Open the files and copy and paste to a new folder you create.  If your data was on an sd card you can just pull out the sd card and plug it in your pc with an adapter.  Either way ALL files should be visible with the usb cable.  Your pictures from the camera will be under a fie called DCIM.  Good luck...hope that helps without going through any expense.
