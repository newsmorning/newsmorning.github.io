Windows 20H2 Users Beware of Major Defender Malfunction If you’re relying on Windows Defender to keep your computer safe, you may want to think twice before upgrading to the latest version of Windows 10. The 20H2 release, which Microsoft started rolling out in October 2020, comes with a major Defender malfunction that can leave your system vulnerable to all kinds of threats.\nThe issue, which has been reported by a growing number of users, prevents Defender from scanning files or allowing other security products to access them. This means that any malware or suspicious file on your computer can go undetected, potentially causing serious harm to your data and privacy.\nWhat Causes the Malfunction?\nAccording to Microsoft, the Defender malfunction can be caused by certain third-party antivirus programs that are incompatible with the new version of Windows. These programs may interfere with Defender’s ability to scan files and cause it to report false positives or even crash.\nAnother possible cause is a bug in the Windows Security app, which could prevent Defender from launching or updating properly.\nWhat Are the Risks?\nThe consequences of a Defender malfunction can be severe. Without proper protection, your computer is at risk of malware infections, including viruses, Trojans, worms, and ransomware. Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities in your system to steal your personal and financial information, hijack your online accounts, or launch attacks on other computers connected to your network.\nMoreover, a Defender malfunction could also affect your ability to use other security tools or software that rely on Defender’s services, such as Windows Firewall or Windows Update. This could further compromise your system’s overall security and stability.\nWhat Can You Do?\nIf you’re a Windows 10 user on version 20H2 or later, it’s essential to check whether Defender is working correctly and taking all necessary steps to safeguard your computer. Here are some tips to help you:\nUpdate your antivirus software: If you’re using a third-party antivirus program, make sure it’s compatible with Windows 10 version 20H2 and has the latest updates installed. This should prevent any conflicts with Defender and keep your computer protected.\nVerify Defender’s settings: Open the Windows Security app and check that all settings for Defender are enabled and up-to-date. You can also run a quick or full scan to see if there are any threats detected.\nUse other security tools: Consider installing additional security software, such as a malware scanner or a firewall, to complement Defender and add an extra layer of protection. Make sure these tools are also compatible with Windows 10 version 20H2.\nKeep Windows updated: Microsoft has released several patches and updates to address the Defender issue and other security vulnerabilities in Windows 10. Make sure your system is up-to-date with the latest patches to avoid any known issues.\nMonitor your system: Regularly check your computer for any signs of unusual activity or suspicious files. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, run a malware scan and seek help from a reputable security expert.\nIn Conclusion\nThe Windows Defender malfunction in Windows 10 version 20H2 is a serious issue that can put your computer at risk of cyber attacks and data breaches. To avoid any potential threats, make sure to follow the best practices for computer security, keep your software updated, and seek help if you suspect a problem. By staying vigilant and proactive, you can keep your computer safe from harm and enjoy a hassle-free experience.\nNot everyone is interested in looking for antivirus protection from other companies, and would rather stick with Microsoft’s security solutions.\nDefender is the root cause for high memory usage and black screens on Windows 10 20H2.Apparently, the problem isn’t new and has been observed causing trouble for the past month.This bug also affects software such as Windows Event Viewer, Word 2016, and newer versions. Defender was recently rated pretty high for the services it provides, so that’s not a bad thing at all, considering how much time the company puts into perfecting it.\nHowever, Defender users are not having such a great time lately, as the software is causing all sorts of major issues for the Windows 20H2 users.\nBlack screens and high memory usage on Windows 20H2 To be more exact, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is apparently the root cause of some pretty nasty problems for some client systems with the 20H2 version of Windows 10.\nAccording to Borncity, this is not something that happened overnight, as these severe issues have been observed for almost a month.\nThus, if you are also running the above-mentioned version of the OS, don’t be surprised if you experience very high memory usage.\nFurthermore, you can expect black screen issues after logging in. There’s also a high chance that Word 2016 and newer will fail to open or will take a long time to do so.\nNot to mention that Windows Event Viewer takes a really long time to show events, both remote as well as local.\nSecurity experts believe that the high memory usage issue is likely caused by a memory leak bug. However, the problem is not new and Microsoft had fixed the issue once earlier.\nKeep in mind that the high memory usage by Defender’s Antimalware Service Executable process (MsMpEng.exe) is a quite common bug.\nThat being said, a temporary workaround to reduce the memory consumption is to disable the Real-time Protection, just in case you were wondering.\nSo, if you were experiencing any of these situations, know that it is a known issue and it is being currently worked on.\nHave you had any trouble with Defender on your Windows 20H2 machine?
