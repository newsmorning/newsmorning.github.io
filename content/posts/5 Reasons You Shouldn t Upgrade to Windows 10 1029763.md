Title: You won't believe the shocking reasons why you should NOT upgrade to Windows 10!

Introduction:
Many users are thrilled with the upgrade to Windows 10, but did you know that there are reasons why you should stick with your current operating system? In this article, we'll explore the shocking reasons why upgrading to Windows 10 might not be the best decision for you.

Section 1: Compatibility issues
One of the main reasons why you should hold off on upgrading to Windows 10 is compatibility issues. Some of your older software and hardware may not be compatible with the latest operating system. If you rely on certain software or hardware for work or daily activities, it's essential to ensure compatibility before upgrading.

Section 2: Privacy concerns
Another reason why some users are hesitant about upgrading to Windows 10 is privacy concerns. Windows 10 collects various data on the user, including personal information and usage information. While Microsoft has provided the option to turn off data collection, some users are still uneasy about the issue, and Microsoft's response to those concerns has been unclear.

Section 3: Forced updates
Another huge change from previous Windows operating systems is the lack of control over updates. In Windows 10, users no longer have the option to disable updates, which can be frustrating for some users. Some updates may even cause issues with your system, including slow performance or driver malfunctions.

Section 4: Learning Curve
Finally, upgrading to Windows 10 may require a learning curve for users. The system can be different from the previous operating systems, and the interface can take some getting used to. For users who are comfortable with their current system, the adjustment period can be time-consuming and frustrating.

Conclusion:
While there are many great features in Windows 10, there are valid concerns that users should consider when upgrading. Compatibility issues, privacy concerns, forced updates, and the learning curve are all factors that users should keep in mind before deciding to upgrade. Ultimately, the decision comes down to each individual user and what is essential for their daily computing needs.

In a previous segment, we covered the things Windows 10 does that make it score big with users. This next segment is for the naysayers who are not as enamoured as we are with this fancy new toy. The following issues arose as we acquainted ourselves with Windows 10:
 
## Windows Media Center is missing in action
 
The demise of Windows Media Center doesn’t come as a surprise however as it was discontinued soon after the release of Windows 7. What comes as a surprise is the removal of DVD playback in Windows 10. Users still dependent on DVDs are left high and dry unless you consider the basic Windows DVD Player app an option (which we don’t). The disintegration of the entertainment applications is irksome to boot. The Groove Music app handles audio files, the Movies & TV app handles movies (Not sure how the TV part works) and the previously mentioned DVD Player app. Makes one wonder why Microsoft didn’t just merge all these apps into one for convenience.
 
P.S: Windows Media Player is still around floating somewhere in the background. Microsoft has not yet bowed to mounting pressure to have it upgraded for Windows 10 though. Reason enough for users to stick with windows 7 that still has the Windows Media Center.
 
## Cortana isn’t supported yet in Africa
 
 Our excitement over the prospect of using the much-hyped digital personal assistant were short-lived. Apparently Cortana isn’t supported yet in Africa and much of the world as it is. What else would entice one to upgrade to Windows 10? Windows 7 and 8.1 are as solid as they come and they don’t raise our hopes for nothing.
 
## Windows Store: Not sufficient apps 
 
Microsoft has been trying to drum up support for its fledgling Store app for some time now to no avail. The adage, ‘’All that glitters…” comes to mind when one uses the Windows Store app. Solid apps are few and far between. Supposedly free game and utility apps offer only a few levels before one is required to upgrade to premium for more utility or to get rid of those pesky ads (Microsoft Solitaire Collection included). What sucks more is that installing the apps forces one to change from the local account into a Microsoft account otherwise some features might not work properly. This whole Windows Store business and forced Microsoft account login shows how upgrading isn’t worth the sweat.
 
## Privacy issues: Big brother is over watching 
 
Microsoft appears to have taken more than a leaf from Google. The sheer amount of user information Microsoft is harvesting is finally raising eyebrows. Be it the various Windows apps or the Windows system itself, Microsoft has strategically modified Windows 10 to collect all manner of sensitive information back to its servers. Cortana familiarises itself with your mail, passwords, search queries, local and online files. All this private information swimming around on the web enticing hackers to access it is frankly an amateur move for any self-respecting security-conscious individual.
 
## Forced Automatic Updates
 
Sneaky, sneaky Microsoft has been lambasted for shoving Windows 10 down the throats of satisfied users of previous versions (Which they later conveniently blamed on a bug). What choice is there in the system informing you that your copy of Windows 10 has been downloaded successfully (without your consent) so you might as well install it, thank-you-very-much.
 
Matter of fact, Windows 10 has no visible function for turning off automatic updates or the option to choose particular updates unlike previous versions.  This a bummer for those working with a limited MBs or not interested in half-baked patches prone to causing stability issues.
 
## Verdict
 
Are you comfy with your tried-and-tested Windows 7? Does 8.1 do it for you splendidly? Are you still on the formidable XP? If so, stay there! Microsoft has been a tad too liberal with their modifications on Windows 10 to side-line a number of users who much preferred how things were before.
