Top Chinese smartphone maker Infinix is gearing up for the launch of a new smartphone in Uganda. The company recently launched the Infinix Hot 7 in the country and now it is all set to come up with an upgrade to the selfie-centric S series, the Infinix S4. The company has already launched the Infinix S4 in Nigeria, Kenya and other markets. Infinix Mobility will launch its latest flagship smartphone, the Infinix S4 in Uganda on 6th May 2019.
 
Just like the previous Infinix S3, the S4’s unique selling
point will be its selfie camera. It will be the first smartphone with 32MP
selfie camera to launch in Uganda. Yes, 32MP in charge of your selfie needs
(and all the social media lovers say Amen).
 
The phone packs more than just a powerful selfie. At the
back is a trinity of camera sensors to complete the optics department, three
vertically arranged cameras. Even before we get to the pixel count, this
already looks like the phone to accompany you on the photo spree.
 
The new Infinix S4 supersedes the Infinix Hot S3 (Hot S3 review) and is the first Infinix device to come out-of-the-box running the Android 9 Pie OS. It is also the first device coming with a water drop-shaped display notch and triple rear-camera setup.
 
The Infinix S4 will come with so many improvements from last year’s S3. The new King of selfies is expected to retail at about UGX 585,000/=. The S4 will be available in multiple paint jobs to allow you to express yourself more.
