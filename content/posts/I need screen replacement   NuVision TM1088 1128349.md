The Nuvision TM1088 is a fantastic tablet that is packed with features such as a speedy processor, a great battery life, and a large and vibrant display. However, as with any electronic device, the TM1088 is not immune to damage, and if you are one of the many people who have cracked their screen or are experiencing issues with their display, then you are probably looking for a fix.

In this article, we will take you through a step-by-step guide on how to replace your Nuvision TM1088's screen. While this process may seem intimidating at first, it is straightforward and easy to follow, and the end result will be a shiny and brand new display!

## Step 1: Gathering the necessary tools and equipment

Before you start, you will need to ensure that you have all the necessary tools and equipment on hand. This includes:

- A replacement screen for the Nuvision TM1088
- A set of screwdrivers (both flathead and Phillips head)
- A pry tool or plastic spudger
- A heat gun or hairdryer
- A workspace that is clean and free of dust and debris
- A pair of gloves

## Step 2: Removing the back cover of the tablet

The first step in the screen replacement process is to remove the back cover of your Nuvision TM1088. To do this, you will need to use your pry tool or plastic spudger to carefully pry the cover off the tablet, being careful not to damage any of the components inside.

## Step 3: Disconnecting the battery

Once you have removed the back cover of the tablet, you will need to disconnect the battery. To do this, locate the battery connector and gently pull it out of its socket. This will ensure that no power is flowing to the tablet while you are working on it and prevent any accidental damage.

## Step 4: Removing the broken screen

With the battery disconnected, you can now begin the process of removing the broken screen from your Nuvision TM1088. To do this, you will need to use your heat gun or hairdryer to soften the adhesive around the edges of the screen. Once the adhesive is softened, use your pry tool or plastic spudger to carefully loosen the screen and remove it from the tablet.

## Step 5: Installing the new screen

With the old screen removed, you can now begin installing the new one. Start by carefully aligning the new screen with the tablet's chassis and then gently press it into place. Once the screen is in place, reconnect the battery and replace the back cover of the tablet.

## Step 6: Testing the new screen

Once you have replaced the back cover of your Nuvision TM1088, turn the tablet on and test the new screen. If everything is working correctly, you should see a bright and clear display. If there are any issues, double-check that all the connectors are securely in place and try again.

In conclusion, replacing the screen on your Nuvision TM1088 is not as daunting as it may seem. With this guide and a little patience, you can have a brand new display in no time. Remember to always work in a clean and dust-free environment, use the proper tools, and take your time to avoid damaging any of the components inside the tablet.


## Chosen Solution
 Why is my screen is unresponsive

 Make more Ram available (Delete/close unused applications that may be running>  Re-calibrate screen usually found in settings>  Reset (Can be found here NuVision TM1088 Troubleshooting)>  Realign display (requires opening device) >then maybe a replacing something but need more info. 
If you can post pictures of tablet and what it is doing that would be helpful. Is it part of screen or full screen? Is the screen damaged? What happened prior to this occurring (if you know, i have kids so i understand that “all of a sudden” it doesn’t work)?

 Has the tablet said UI unresponsive? That’s when the touch screen freezes up. I just pulled my battery out and reset it on my phone but you may have to go to where ever you got said tablet from
