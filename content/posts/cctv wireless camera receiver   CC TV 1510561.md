Don. I have opened it and there is no sign of any visible  damage. no burnt anything or burnt smell it looks good.

You'll have to open it up and view the extent of the damage.
Hopefully the power supply input section will have borne the brunt of the oversupply voltage and the damage will not have gone further into the device.
Post some close up pictures of the affected area and perhaps someone here may be able to help.
