## Chosen Solution
 After tightening an accessory into place with the collett nut, it doesn’t grip enough, so tool such a saw just stops when pressed against object.

 Measure the shaft on the tool in question. It is probably 3/32” and you probably have a 1/8” collet installed in the collet nut. If you have lost that part or did not get it with the tool they are readily available on line.
