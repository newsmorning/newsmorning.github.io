Is Your AEG SCS51800F0 Freezer Refusing to Chill? Here's the Surprising Solution!

If you are fed up with your AEG SCS51800F0 freezer not keeping your food frozen, then this article is just for you. A faulty freezer can cause a lot of inconvenience, particularly if you need to store food for a large family. However, before you replace your freezer or spend any money on repairs, here's a surprising solution that you may not have considered.

Defrost Your Freezer

The problem may not be with your freezer. Instead, your freezer may be working perfectly, but it might just have a buildup of ice that's preventing it from working correctly. In this instance, the solution is straightforward, defrost your freezer.

Many people don't realize that their freezer needs to be defrosted periodically. Over time, a layer of ice can build up on the freezer's coils, preventing the freezer from cooling correctly. When this happens, your freezer will stop working correctly, and your food will thaw out.

Now, defrosting your freezer is not something you should do every week, but you should do it at least once a year (depending on your usage). Here's how you can do it.

Step 1: Turn off the freezer and disconnect it from the wall socket.

Step 2: Remove all the food from the freezer and place it in a cooler or another freezer (if you have one).

Step 3: Place a bowl of hot water in the freezer (leave the door open) to help melt the ice buildup. Another method is leaving the door open for 24-48 hours.

Step 4: Once the ice has melted, use a cloth to wipe down the freezer's interior to remove any excess water.

Step 5: Plug the freezer back in and turn it back on.

Step 6: Wait for the freezer to reach the correct temperature before you start putting food back in.

By following the above steps, you'll be surprised at how well your freezer works. Not only will its performance improve, but food wastage will reduce in the long run, ultimately saving you cash.

Conclusion

If your AEG SCS51800F0 freezer is not keeping your food frozen, don't jump to conclusions and replace it or pay for costly repairs. Instead, defrost your freezer to eliminate any ice buildup that's causing the problem. By doing this, you'll help reduce food waste and potentially save yourself some money.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi there,
After any help please. My Husband has defrosted our freezer and it's now stopped freezing. He took to the top 'ceiling' with a hammer and I think he could have damaged something. Is there anything I can do? We have a freezer full of food that's defrosting and I'm 3 weeks away from having our third baby, could really do without this right now

 I can't See the photo but if your evaporator coil is top mounted it would likely have been damaged by a hammer. First make Sure the Compressor is running. Next Remove the panel over the evaporator Inside the freezer. Make Sure it has an even layer of Frost on it. If it is only partially frosted you may need a new freezer (evaporator coils are very $$$).
