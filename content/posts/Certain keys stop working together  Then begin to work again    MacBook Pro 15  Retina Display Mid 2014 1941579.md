## Chosen Solution
 I’ve had this problem for approximately a year now. Certain keys on the keyboard stop working.
The backspace key, F1, 1, Q, F11, F12
All these keys stop working together. Never by themselves. Sometimes the fault lasts for a minute. Then spontaneously resolves. Sometimes for hours - so I’ve resorted to using a plug-in USB keyboard for the past year instead.

I was wondering if this was a common problem? Any advise is greatly appreciated

 This sounds like a keyboard short, most commonly caused by a spill.
