In a world where technology is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, accidents are bound to happen. No matter how careful we are with our devices, something unexpected can always happen. One such incident occurred recently, which left a young girl's MacBook Air damaged beyond repair. Here's how it all went down.

It was a typical weekday morning, and the daughter had just returned from her early classes. She left her MacBook Air on the kitchen counter and went to get some breakfast. However, as she was pouring herself a bowl of cereal, her mom accidentally knocked over a glass of juice, which spilled all over the counter and onto the MacBook Air. The daughter was in shock and immediately rushed to wipe the laptop dry, but it was too late. The MacBook Air refused to turn on, and all signs of life had seemingly vanished.

The daughter was devastated. She had saved up for months to purchase the MacBook Air and had even taken out a loan to cover the remaining balance. Losing her laptop meant losing her academic materials, her work, and her money. It was a nightmare scenario for her.

But then something unexpected happened. She turned to Apple's customer service to inquire about repair options. They told her that while the damage appeared irreversible, there may be a chance to recover some of her data. Apple's technician suggested sending the MacBook Air to their data recovery team, which would attempt to retrieve any lost files from the hard drive.

Three days later, the daughter received a call from Apple. The technician informed her that they had successfully recovered all of her data, including her essays, projects, and notes. And not only that, but Apple had decided to send her a brand-new MacBook Air, free of charge.

The daughter could not believe her luck. She had never experienced such great customer service before. Although the incident had left her with a bad taste in her mouth, Apple had gone above and beyond to ensure that she was satisfied with the outcome.

In conclusion, accidents with technology can be frustrating and costly, especially when it involves high-end equipment like the MacBook Air. But, as in this story, sometimes the unexpected can happen, and businesses like Apple can recover our data and replace our equipment, leaving the customer happier than ever.

 Hi My daughters MacBook A1932 screen broken, we want through Apple service, they checked n recommended to change screen only. All MacBook is good, no other issues. Can I replace only top screen ( not total screen assembly). Thanks

 Sadly, you can’y replace the discreet parts of the display like we could years ago.
But replacing the display assembly (lid and all) is quite easy! Here’s the needed part MacBook Air 13" (Late 2018-Early 2020) Display Assembly currently iFixit only has the gold one. But maybe that not so bad! I might be fun having a two-tone! Here’s the guide to put it in MacBook Air 13” Retina Display Late 2018 Display Replacement
