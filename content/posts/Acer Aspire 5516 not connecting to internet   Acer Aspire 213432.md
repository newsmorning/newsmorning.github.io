Attention all Acer Aspire 5516 laptop owners: are you tired of facing disconnection issues with your device? You're not alone. Many users have reported experiencing frequent disconnections, often leading to frustration and hindering productivity. But rest assured, there are ways to fix this issue and get your laptop back on track.

First off, it's important to understand the root cause of this problem. The Acer Aspire 5516 contains a Qualcomm Atheros Wi-Fi adapter that has been known to cause disconnection issues. This adapter has a tendency to disconnect randomly, and sometimes it can also prevent the laptop from reconnecting to the internet. The good news is that this can be resolved through a few simple steps.

The first step is to ensure that your laptop is up to date with the latest drivers. You can do this by going to Acer's official website and downloading the latest drivers for your device. Once installed, the drivers will help optimize your Wi-Fi connection and resolve any issues with the adapter.

Another effective solution is to modify your laptop's power settings. This involves disabling the "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" feature on your Wi-Fi adapter. By doing this, you'll effectively prevent the adapter from randomly disconnecting and ensure that it remains connected to the internet.

To modify your power settings, simply navigate to the device manager on your laptop and locate the Qualcomm Atheros Wi-Fi adapter. Right-click on it and select the "properties" option. From there, go to the "power management" tab and uncheck the box that says "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power." Click "save" and you're all set!

One last option is to invest in an external USB Wi-Fi adapter. This is a great workaround for those who are not comfortable modifying their laptop's settings or are unsure of how to update their driver software. An external adapter will allow you to connect to the internet without relying on your laptop's built-in Wi-Fi connection.

In conclusion, disconnection issues can be a major headache for Acer Aspire 5516 users. But with the right solutions in place, this problem can easily be resolved. By updating your drivers, modifying power settings, or investing in an external adapter, you can prevent disconnections and get back to using your laptop seamlessly.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi! I had reacently purchased an Acer aspire laptop and everything was working okay on it but it was super slow and I couldn’t download anything on it so I decided to factory data reset it to see if I could maybe just start the whole thing over again and maybe possibly change from windows vista to windows 7 but after I reset the entire thing o can’t access the internet at all even when I have it plugged up to the modem. It says I’m connected but when I try to open internet explorer it says I’m not connected. If anyone knows how to help please tell me!

 Right click on and select troubleshoot problems, windows will automatically diagnose your internet connection and fix all the possible errors after finishing up check whether the issue is resolved or not
