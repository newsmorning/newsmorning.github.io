# How to Recover Lost Files When Your Desktop PC Factory Reset Goes Wrong - Expert Tips!

Imagine you woke up one day, powered on your desktop PC, and it starts acting weird. You tried everything and nothing seems to work, so you concluded a factory reset is the best option.

You ran the factory reset option from the recovery partition, and suddenly, you discover that you have lost all your files: music, photos, documents, everything you worked so hard to save.

It's a tough situation, but it does happen, and it can cause unnecessary stress and loss of valuable data. However, with the following expert tips, you can still recover your lost data even when your factory reset fails.

## Step 1: Stop Using the Device Immediately

The first and most crucial step is to stop using the device. The more you use the device, the higher the chance of overwriting the lost data. It’s important to turn off the device immediately, remove it from the power source, and disconnect all external devices.

At this point, it’s recommended to take the device to an expert to prevent further damage to the hardware and maximize the chances of recovering the lost data.

## Step 2: Check for Backup Files

If you’ve set up any backup systems such as cloud storage, external hard drives, or automatic backups, then your lost files may still be retrievable. Check these backup systems, and you may find your lost data still intact.

## Step 3: Use Recovery Software

If backup options have failed or are unavailable, then you can try using data recovery tools. These software applications are designed to recover files from corrupted or formatted hard drives.

There are many data recovery tools available, including Recuva, TestDisk, and EaseUS. These recovery software applications have tailored methods to try to recover the lost data, so it’s important to research and choose the best one for your situation.

## Step 4: Get Professional Help

If you are not familiar with using data recovery software, it’s recommended to seek professional help. Data recovery experts have extensive knowledge and expertise in retrieving lost data.

They can use advanced techniques to recover files from damaged or formatted hard drives. Even when your factory reset has gone wrong, there is still a chance to recover your lost data with the help of a professional.

## Step 5: Prevent Future Data Loss

To prevent losing data in the future, it’s important to keep regular backups of your files. Backups can be created using external hard drives, cloud storage, or automatic backups.

Additionally, be cautious when resetting your device, as it can erase all of your files. Always backup files before performing any major change to your system.

In conclusion, a failed factory reset can be stressful, but it doesn't mean you've lost everything. With the help of data recovery tools or professionals, you can re-access your data. Prevent future data loss by keeping backups of your files and being careful when resetting your device.

## Chosen Solution
 After factory reset I didnt find my files

 Stop using the computer, turn it off. Take it to a computer shop so they can use recovery software to get whatever is left..
If your data you lost is important there is no simple way to get it back. Software recovery is never 100%

 @yohannes61 what type of files? It is possible that they got overwritten when you performed the factory reset. You need to tell us what OS you are using and what type of files you are looking for. Also tell us what you have tried to recover those files.

 If you did a factory reset stop using the computer and pull the hard drive . Place it in an external enclosure or use some other method of connecting it. Connect to another computer and us a program called Zar X then run a drive recovery . You will end up with a lot of raw data but you will be able to recover what hasn't already been overwritten . You will require a large amount of storage as you will be recovering as much data as was originally on the drive including things you deleted in the past that weren't overwritten . hope this helps

 Try with Recuva free software, it worked to me a couple times when i had to find an erased file, are the same guys who use CCleaner to fix registry issues on windows, also cleans innecessary files, freeing lots of space. https://www.piriform.com/recuva
