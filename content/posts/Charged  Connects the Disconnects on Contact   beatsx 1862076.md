## Chosen Solution
 My BeatsX will fully charge, and if held in the right position will connect. However, as soon as the wire by the charging port moves, it disconnects from the phone/shuts off. It seems as though there’s a short in the chord. How can I fix this? Do you guys know places near Cincinnati that would work on them? Thanks!

 Sadly, there is little you can do as any surgery will kill the patient!
While you could cut the case off to gain access to the wires to hopefully patch them, you won’t be able to reseal things to the point it will hold up very long.
