Dell has taken it upon themselves to build a powerful Windows 10 device that will incorporate all computing experiences into a single consolidated handset. The mighty Windows 10 Mobile possesses an x86 CPU from Intel’s Kaby Lake Y-series of processors, with 4GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB storage as well as a microSD slot for expansion.
 
It is reported that the project was initiated back in mid-2014 under the name ‘Dell Stack’, and focuses on a 6.4-inch mini-tablet designed to measure less than 9 mm in thickness and would be used to power desktop, laptop and tablet computing experiences. Furthermore, it is to come with features such as an iris scanner for Microsoft’s Windows Hello biometric authentication. (So, more like a tablet-ish smartphone.) Just lask week, leaked photos of the phone emerged and gave some insight to what the company has planned for their phone.
 
Dell has drawn inspiration from the idea of combining all separate devices into a whole to save users the hassle of having to move their data from one device to the next, or uploading it to the cloud for safe keeping or easy access.
 
The device is to come with the Windows 10’s Continuum feature that allows a supporting high-end device to connect to a larger external screen and deliver a desktop environment with a familiar taskbar, start menu and more. So far, Microsoft has failed to run Windows 10 as a full version on mobile devices because of hardware restrictions, but Universal Windows Platform apps (UWP) are an evergreen alternative.
 
Given the OEM’s genuine interest in Windows 10 Mobile, the project ‘Stack’ — if delivered as anticipated — would definitely turn out to be a massive success. But Microsoft’s jinxed attempts at Windows Mobile devices has left OEMs nothing but disappointed.
 
At this point, it still unclear whether this powerful idea could materialize into an actual product or not. The last we heard about Dell’s project (internally referred to as “Stack”), suggested a Spring 2017 launch, but there has still been no official announcement from the manufacturers.
