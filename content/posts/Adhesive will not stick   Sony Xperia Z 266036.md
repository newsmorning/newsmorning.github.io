Title: You'll Never Believe Why The Adhesive on Your Sony Xperia Z Won't Stick!

Subheading: The Surprising Reason Behind The Failed Adhesive of Your Sony Xperia Z

Introduction:

Are you frustrated about the adhesive on your Sony Xperia Z not sticking on properly? Have you tried different methods to make it hold on, but still end up slipping off? You're not alone. Many Sony Xperia Z users experience the same frustration which leads them to question the quality of the device. However, in this article, we will uncover the real reason behind this issue.

Body:

The Sony Xperia Z is a flagship Android smartphone that boasts an elegant design and high-end features. It's also known for its durability, being waterproof and dustproof. The device is built with premium materials, which adds to its stylish look and high-quality finish, including its adhesive that holds the back cover in place.

But why is it that some Sony Xperia Z users are encountering adhesive issues?

The culprit is the moisture. Yes, you read that right. As much as the Sony Xperia Z is crafted to withstand water, it also makes it prone to moisture accumulation. When moisture seeps into the phone, it affects the adhesion of the phone's back cover. When the adhesive dries out, it becomes brittle and unable to hold the cover in place, and eventually falls off.

So how do you fix this issue? Here are some practical solutions:

1. Remove the moisture - Place your Sony Xperia Z in a dry place or use a fan to dry out the moisture that accumulates inside the phone. You can also use a silica gel packet, which can be found in most electronic stores, to absorb the moisture.

2. Renew the adhesive - There are adhesives available in the market specifically designed for smartphones. They are easy to apply, and the new adhesive will provide better bonding than the original adhesive. You can also visit a phone repair shop to replace the adhesive.

3. Prevent moisture buildup - As much as possible, avoid exposing your Sony Xperia Z to water or moisture. Use a water-resistant phone case or cover to protect your device. Ensure the charging port, headphone jack, and other openings are tightly sealed.

Conclusion:

To sum it up, moisture accumulation is the culprit behind the adhesive issue on your Sony Xperia Z. The moisture affects the adhesive, making it brittle and ultimately causing it to fall off. By removing the moisture, renewing the adhesive, and preventing moisture accumulation, you can keep your Sony Xperia Z's adhesive working correctly. Remember, your Sony Xperia Z is built to last, but it also requires proper care and maintenance to ensure it functions optimally.

## Chosen Solution
 I just fixed a Sony Xperia Z and after a little while the adhesive does not want to hold the screen in some places. Do i need to buy a better adhesive?

 This seems to be a big issue with S5's and Sony Experia's. Best thing to do is to make sure you thoroughly clean frame, apply a plastic adhesive activator and use high quality adhesive's. Also you need to check your frame/chassis for damage, separation, and or whether or not its bent.  We've been looking for a supplier for Sony Experia OEM water proof adhesive. If anyone knows where to get it can you please let us know. Thanks

 heat it up with a hair dryer carefully, then put it on its back facing down, put a little weight on the top and leave to set. as mentioned above make sure the bezel is clean from the old adhesive, there is a glue that does help called B7000 we sell this on our site and its a great glue for this type of job, not corrosive like superglue and its flexible at the same time.
