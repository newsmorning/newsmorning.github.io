Apple has shocked its customers by disabling the cellular function on the iPad Mini 2 LTE. This move has left users wondering why they are unable to connect to cellular networks on their devices.

The iPad Mini 2 was released back in 2013 and came in both Wi-Fi only and LTE-compatible models. The cellular version of the tablet allowed users to connect to mobile networks and access the internet on the go. However, it seems that Apple has decided to disable the cellular function on the device, leaving only the Wi-Fi option available.

Many users have taken to social media to express their frustration at Apple's decision. Some have even speculated that it was a ploy by Apple to get users to upgrade to newer models of the iPad.

However, Apple has come forward with an explanation for the disabling of the cellular function. The company has stated that it is due to the aging hardware of the device. The iPad Mini 2 is no longer receiving software updates from Apple, and as a result, the hardware is unable to support the latest cellular technology.

Many users have questioned this explanation, as the cellular function has been disabled even for those who were previously able to use it without any issues. It is unclear why Apple has chosen to disable the function for these users as well.

This move by Apple has also sparked concerns about the sustainability of its products. Disabling the cellular function on a device that is only eight years old seems wasteful and may deter customers from purchasing Apple products in the future.

Ultimately, the disabling of the cellular function on the iPad Mini 2 LTE has left many users frustrated and disappointed. While Apple has provided an explanation for the move, it remains to be seen whether or not users will be satisfied with the response. It is clear that this move has brought up larger questions about product sustainability and customer trust in Apple.

## Chosen Solution
 I purchased a used Model a1490 from a baggage reclaim store. The cellular function is disabled. The model number reported in general/about is mf066ll/a. There is not a mini sim installed. I have installed one and it has made no difference. When I ourchased the unit the clerk said they disabled the cellular. I'm wondering if there is a way to return that functionality
Thank You

 My guess is that the device has a bad esn. After the original owner lost it they  probably didn't pay it off with their cellular provider so the device was blacklisted. The people that sold it to you didn't disable it, the wireless carrier did. Once a device has a bad esn/imei, it's pretty much not possible to make it good again.  Of course, the wireless carrier can only stop you from using the cellular data function, nothing else. So you basically now have a wifi iPad
