The year has been nothing short of outstanding for Xiaomi. The smartphone giant was in the news as it surpassed Apple in the sale of smartphones, to become the second-largest smartphone manufacturer on the globe, for the second quarter of the year – with Samsung still holding the top position. Xiaomi just concluded its 2021 event where it unveiled a number of devices – the Xiaomi 11T series was one. The device is feature-packed – you should check it out. Xiaomi also unveiled the Xiaomi Pad 5 – it is Xiaomi’s first tablet in a really long time. 
 
Xiaomi’s last tablet (the MI Pad 4) was launched in 2018. The brand is looking to give the likes of Apple and Samsung a run for their money in the tablet department. The new tablet comes with upgrades in major areas. Here are 5 things to like about Xiaomi’s Mi Pad 5.

## 1. Stylus pen 
 
The Xiaomi Pad 5 supports the Xiaomi smartpen, which is sold separately from the pad, unfortunately. The pen connects via Bluetooth to the pad. The pad also comes with a magnetic dock (installed on the right side of the pad) that houses, recharges, and connects the pen to the pad when placed on it.

## 2. Snapdragon 860
 
This device is powered by the Snapdragon 860 processor, and Xiaomi says with the flagship 7nanometer process technology, the performance on the pad has been massively improved. When you watch videos, play games, or surf the webs, the processor lets you enjoy the speed.
 
## 3. Design
 
First off, let’s talk about the display size. I consider this the most important feature of any tablet – considering they’ll be doing the job of a laptop, it is important that they have sizable screens. The Xiaomi Pad 5 is an 11-inch display screen, which is slightly bigger than the 10.2-inch display screen of the iPad. We also found the design of this device really interesting. The edges are angular and flat, just like on the iPad.
 
## 4. Display
 
This device comes with a 2560 x 1600 screen resolution. It also features the Dolby Vision tuning and True Display. There is a 120Hz refresh rate which ensures an altogether smooth visual experience, whether you’re swiping as you browse the internet, or while playing a game. 
 
## 5. MIUI for Pad
 
The operating system of the Xiaomi Pad 5 is what Xiaomi calls MIUI. The operating system comes with a number of features: 
 
- The built-in split-screen multitasking feature lets you divide the big screen into two for easier multi-tasking.App Withdrawal: This lets you conveniently access all your applications in one place, instead of having to look around all your home screens.Mini Window: Mini window lets you have up to two applications running at the same time.

 
## The Alternative Tablet
 
The Xiaomi Pad 5 was unveiled days after the Apple event which saw the unveiling of the Apple iPad 9. This move by Xiaomi is an indication that the Xiaomi Pad 5 is coming in as a rival to the iPad, Samsung Galaxy tab, and any other tablet out there. The Xiaomi Pad 5 is one of the best Android tablets you’re going to find around – going by its specs sheet. The tablet cost £369 (roughly $510) for the 6GB RAM and 128GB storage model. And for almost half the price of the Galaxy tab S7+, it is the ideal alternative.
