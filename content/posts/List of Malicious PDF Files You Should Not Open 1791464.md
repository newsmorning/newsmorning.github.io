Don't Open Any PDFs Until You See This Shocking List of Malicious Files!

Are you always suspicious about opening PDFs, as they may contain malicious files that could harm your system? If yes, then you are right to do so. PDFs have become one of the most popular formats for sharing documents online, but they are also a common way for hackers to distribute malware.

Many unsuspecting users get tricked into opening PDF files that appear to be legitimate, only to find themselves facing a range of cyber threats, such as malware, viruses, and ransomware. So, it's crucial to be cautious while downloading and opening PDFs from unknown sources.

Here's a list of some of the most harmful PDFs that have been circulating around the internet:

1. Fake Adobe PDF updates

Hackers use fake Adobe PDF updates to lure users into downloading malware. They may appear to be legitimate Adobe updates, but in reality, they are harmful files that install malware onto your system.

2. Phishing PDFs

Phishing PDFs are designed to steal sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and banking details. These files often pretend to be from reputable companies, such as banks or online retailers, and trick users into sharing their personal information.

3. PDFs with embedded hyperlinks

Some PDFs contain embedded hyperlinks that lead to malicious websites. Once users click on those links, they're directed to a website that could install malware or steal their personal information.

4. PDFs with Macros

PDFs with Macros are another way that hackers can infect your system. Macros are small programs that are used to automate tasks, but they can also be used to execute malicious code.

5. Malicious PDFs with embedded JavaScript

Malicious PDFs with embedded JavaScript are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader or Acrobat. Once executed, they can be used to steal sensitive data or install malware.

So, what can you do to protect your system from malicious PDFs?

First, be cautious while downloading and opening PDFs from unknown sources. If possible, only download PDFs from trusted websites or email attachments from trusted sources. Always run a scan of the file before opening it.

Second, ensure that you have updated antivirus software installed on your system. Antivirus software can identify and block harmful files before they can do any damage.

Lastly, keep your system and all applications updated with the latest security patches. This will help to protect your system from known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers.

In conclusion, PDFs are a convenient and easy way for sharing documents, but they can also pose a significant risk to your system. By being vigilant and taking appropriate measures to protect yourself, you can mitigate the risk of becoming a victim of a cyber attack.

## How to Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader?
 
Open Adobe Reader and go to “Edit -> Preferences” or simply press “CTRL + K”.
 

 
From the sidebar, select JavaScript and uncheck “Enable Acrobat JavaScript”.
 
## Other Ways to Protect Yourself
 
First you need to ensure that you never open an email or download anything that is sent to you by an unknown person/source. It is recommended that you always check the name of the file in the email before opening it on your computer or web browser. If you use Gmail, it scans every attachment that is delivered to your Inbox and blocks the infected file if it’s already in your Inbox. Although opening an email is safe, it is still recommended that you avoid opening emails that have attachments or links from unknown senders.
 
Second, ensure that you update your Windows and your antivirus program. It is very important to perform a regular system scan to check if your computer is infected or not. If you are not sure of the PDF files that you have downloaded, you can scan them with Virustotal to make sure they are virus-free .
 
## Final Words
 
As hackers are finding new ways to attack you, you should take all the precautionary steps to make sure your system does not get infected. On the other hand, the antivirus companies are also on the verge of releasing new virus definitions every day. So, it is highly recommended that you install good antivirus software such as Kaspersky or BitDefender, and set them to update definitions automatically.
