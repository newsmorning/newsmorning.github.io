Whether it’s gaming, in the office, or working at home, wires all over the place are annoying. Ever move your mouse and the wire knocks over your water bottle? How about just trying to find a place to put something down, but there are wires everywhere?
 
A good wireless keyboard and mouse combo is exactly what you need. We’re going to show you the best wireless keyboard and mouse combinations for any budget, from the most affordable to the most desirable.
 
## What To Look For In A Wireless Keyboard And Mouse?
 
In our opinion, there are a couple of features you should focus on when looking at a wireless keyboard/mouse combo. When doing research online, we came across a bunch of different features, but the three that we decided to focus on are battery life, ergonomic design and price. 
 

 
#### Battery Life
 
Some companies report battery life based on continuous non-stop use. Some report it based on intermittent average use. Where possible, we’ll specify battery life as either continuous use or regular use.
 
#### Safe For Hands And Wrists
 
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) and other repetitive strain injuries are a cause for concern in the office, or even at home and gaming. CTS often requires surgery to fix, so an ergonomic keyboard is a worthwhile investment. If those are too expensive, look for an adjustable keyboard and contoured mouse.
 
#### Best Price For You
 
We’ve all got different incomes so we all have different budgets. Did you know that businesses treat keyboards and mice as consumable items? They’re in the same class as pens and paper for budgeting. So why overspend on something you are definitely going to throw out?
 
## How We Chose The Best Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combos
 
This review was created through a meta-study of sorts, by reviewing dozens of professional reviews by the most trusted websites, as well as ratings and reviews from people who actually own the devices.
 
Then we put the top contenders into the 7 classes: Gaming, High End, Office, Media, Ergonomic, Energy-efficient, and Budget. If two combos were close in other criteria, we went with the more affordable one.

Millions of people develop Carpal Tunnel Syndrome every year. Women are 3 times more likely to develop it than men. People with diabetes and neurological disorders are more at risk.

#### Kensington Pro Fit Ergonomic
 
Very reasonably priced, the Kensington Pro Fit is the top choice for a few reasons. The USB dongle is replaceable, there’s a 3 mode power-saving switch and the keyboard can be reverse-sloped, meaning the front row set higher than the back row.
 
The right-handed mouse places the wrist in a neutral position. That can take a bit to get used to, but once you do you won’t go back. There are also 5 customizable buttons to make the mouse really your own.

Your budget is a little better than average. Maybe you have a corner office or you’re on your way to one? The keyboard needs to be efficient, quiet, classy but understated. The mouse must have perfect tracking, be comfortable, but just different enough to say you’re not a common person.
 
#### Logitech MX900 Backlit Keyboard and MX Master Mouse Combo
 
There are more expensive keyboards, but they’re almost all in the gaming class. The Logitech MX900 gives you backlight keys but with a classic white light that turns on by proximity sensor and automatically adapts to the darkness of your office.
