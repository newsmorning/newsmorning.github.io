## Chosen Solution
 I am replacing the two iPhone 5 interconnect cables and there are suppose to be adhered to each other. What type of adhesive (conducting or non-conducting) should be used to glue the two interconnect cables together?

 The two interconnecting cables do not need to be connected. You can use a very small piece of double sided tape, but not necessary.
