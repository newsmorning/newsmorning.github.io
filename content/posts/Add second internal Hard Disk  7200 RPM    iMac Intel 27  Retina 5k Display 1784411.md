Transform Your iMac into a Speed Demon with This Easy Hack: Add a Second Internal Hard Disk at Lightning-Fast 7200 RPM!

If you own an iMac, you are already aware of its superior performance capabilities. However, you may still experience lagging during data-intensive operations or when running multiple applications. Most iMac owners opt to replace their regular hard disks with solid-state drives (SSDs) for faster read/write speeds. However, even the fastest SSDs can be a bottleneck when performing certain tasks. This is where adding a second internal hard disk comes in handy.

By adding a second internal hard disk to your iMac, you can increase your storage capacity while improving your computer's overall performance. The key is to use a hard disk with a speed of 7200 RPM. This ensures faster read/write speeds.

Here are the steps to take to add a second internal hard disk to your iMac:

Step 1: Determine the compatibility of your iMac

Before you start, make sure that your iMac is compatible with a second internal hard disk. Check the specifications of your computer to ensure that it has space for an additional hard disk. You will also need a compatible SATA cable.

Step 2: Get the right tools

To perform this hack, you will need a few tools. These include a screwdriver, a static-free mat, and an anti-static wrist strap. These tools prevent electrostatic discharge from damaging sensitive components of your iMac.

Step 3: Buy a 7200 RPM hard disk

Purchase a hard disk with a speed of 7200 RPM. This will ensure faster read/write speeds, which translates to faster performance.

Step 4: Install the hard disk

To install the hard disk, unplug your iMac from its power source and lay it screen-down on the static-free mat. Use your screwdriver to remove the screws that secure the bottom panel of your iMac. Disconnect any cables that are connected to the hard disk. Remove the old hard disk and connect the new one using the SATA cable. Secure the hard disk with screws and reattach any cables that were previously disconnected. Reattach the bottom panel and screws.

Step 5: Configure the hard disk

Once you have installed the new hard disk, you need to configure it. You can do this by going to "Disk Utility" and selecting the new hard disk. Click "Partition" and select the number of partitions you want. Then, format the partition and give it a name.

Step 6: Enjoy your faster iMac

Congratulations! You have successfully added a second internal hard disk to your iMac. You can now enjoy faster read/write speeds and improved performance.

Conclusion

Adding a second internal hard disk to your iMac can make a huge difference in terms of performance. By using a hard disk with a speed of 7200 RPM, you can ensure faster read/write speeds. Follow these steps, and you can easily perform this hack without any professional help.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a new iMac 27" Retina 5k Display bought at the end of the 2016.
I chose  the model with the SSD inside.
I want to put a second internal Hard Disk (7200 RPM) into the iMac so i saw the ifixit guide. Although the guide is very well done and detailed i cannot understand what kind of supports i need to fix the new HD into the iMac, what kind of cables i need to make it working and what other stuff i have to buy to do it.

 The correct guide is this one: iMac Intel 27" Retina 5K Display Hard Drive Replacement. In this case you're adding the 3.5" or 2.5" SATA drive (HD or SSD).
You'll need the proper tools to open the system as the display is glued and you'll need a set of new tape strips: iMac Intel 27" (EMC 2546, 2639, 2806) Adhesive Strips.
I must warn you: You need to follow the IFIXIT guide to the letter! As it's not hard to damage the display just in taking it off. Take your time and don't force things. Having to replace the display would be a costly mistake.
You will need the power/data able unit: iMac Intel 27" 5K (Late 2014-Mid 2015) Hard Drive Cable as your system won't have it. In addition you'll need this in-line thermal sensor: OWC - In-line Digital Thermal Sensor for Hard Drive Upgrade for 27" iMacs 2012 and Later, as well as your HD or SSD drive you are planing on using as well as four stud screws to hold the drive to the frame. Hard drive pins - Apple P/N: 922-7001
If you are thinking on using a 2.5" SSD drive you'll need an adapter frame like this one: OWC - 2.5" to 3.5" Drive Adapter Bracket
