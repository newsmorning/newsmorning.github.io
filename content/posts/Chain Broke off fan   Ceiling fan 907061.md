You Won't Believe What Happened When This Ceiling Fan's Chain Broke Off!

If you've ever had a ceiling fan, you're probably familiar with the pull chain that controls the fan's speed and direction. But have you ever heard of a pull chain breaking off? That's exactly what happened to a young couple in a small town in Indiana – and what followed was utterly unbelievable.

It all started when the couple, who lived in a small bungalow, noticed that their ceiling fan was making an unusual noise. They tried to adjust the speed and direction using the pull chain, but it wouldn't budge. After a few more attempts, the chain finally gave way – much to their surprise.

At first, they didn't think much of it – they assumed they could simply replace the chain and everything would be fine. But when they tried to use the fan again, they quickly realized that something was very wrong.

As soon as they turned on the fan, it began to wobble and sway at an alarming rate. The couple could feel the entire house shaking as if there was an earthquake happening. Within seconds, the fan was spinning so fast that it appeared as if it might take flight.

Panicked, the couple tried to turn off the fan, but the pull chain was still broken. They raced around the room, trying to figure out how to stop this out-of-control ceiling fan. But nothing seemed to work.

Meanwhile, the fan continued to spin at a mind-boggling speed, whipping up dust and debris from across the room. The couple tried to take cover behind a sofa, but the fan seemed to be following them. They thought they were going to die.

Just when they thought it couldn't get any worse, the fan's blades began to sheer off one by one – one hitting the top of the TV, another striking the window. They could see the blades cutting through furniture, lamps and anything in their path.

Eventually, the fan finally came to a stop – the ceiling mount having given way under the stress. The couple stood in shock, staring at their once-peaceful living room now completely devastated by their runaway ceiling fan.

They later discovered that the fan was faulty and the pull chain had snapped, causing an imbalance in the fan's blades. The manufacturer admitted to a defect in the fan, and the couple received compensation for the damage to their home and belongings.

While the couple were lucky to escape the ordeal with their lives, it's a sobering reminder of the potential dangers hidden in everyday household objects. So, next time you hear a funny noise coming from your ceiling fan, don't just ignore it – it could be the start of a wild ride you won't forget.

## Chosen Solution
 Chain turn off and on broke off

 @roymontano ,Roy v.Montano , Remove the light fixture housing from the fan, then unscrew the screws where the light fixture attaches to the fan assembly(trim cover). Switch where the pull chain attaches should now be visible and can be removed. Install the new switch with the pull chain through the housing and tighten the connection. See links below for detailed instruction on ceiling fan switch replacement.
Pretty much any hardware/big box store should have a replacement switch for ceiling fans.  Good luck. I hope this helped you out, if so let me know by pressing the helpful button.

 If the chain broke, but there is still a bit of chain sticking out, then just buy a new chain pull from any hardware store, or even just Walmart.
If the chain is no longer showing outside the housing at all, then check out the links below. The first link below shows the basic process of replacing the light switch pull, and the second video shows the procedure for the 3-speed fan switch replacement. Your model may be different, but the procedure is basically the same. The only difference may be the disassembly process and the location of the screws. If you post the fan's model information, we may be able to assist further.
