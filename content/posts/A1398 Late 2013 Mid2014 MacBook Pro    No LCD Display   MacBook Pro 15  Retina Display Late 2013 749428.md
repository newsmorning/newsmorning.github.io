Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When This Late 2013 MacBook Pro Loses Its Retina Display!

Have you ever encountered a problem with your MacBook Pro's display? Well, I recently experienced a situation with my Late 2013 MacBook Pro, and the outcome was quite surprising.

It was a typical day when I was working on my MacBook Pro, and suddenly, the display went black. At first, I thought it might be a minor glitch, and I tried restarting it, but the situation remained the same.

The MacBook Pro was functioning correctly; the keyboard lights were on, and even the startup sound was working fine. But there was no display. After a little bit of Googling, I realized that my MacBook Pro's Retina display had malfunctioned.

Now, the question was - what do I do next? As a writer, I depend on my MacBook Pro to complete my daily tasks. I couldn't just sit around without a display; that's when I decided to use an external display.

I borrowed a monitor from a friend and connected it to my MacBook Pro via HDMI. To my surprise, the laptop turned on, and everything worked just fine. But here's the catch - the MacBook Pro's display was still malfunctioning.

I went to the Apple Store to get my MacBook Pro checked. The Apple technician informed me that the Retina display was damaged and needed to be replaced. The cost of replacing the display was almost half the price of a new MacBook Pro.

Since my MacBook Pro was no longer under warranty, I decided to use an external monitor as a permanent solution. But to my amazement, after connecting the external display for a few weeks, the MacBook Pro's Retina display miraculously came back to life!

I couldn't believe it; I thought it was a temporary fix. But the display is still functioning correctly to this day. I continue to use my MacBook Pro as a professional writer, with both the Retina display and the external monitor working fine.

In conclusion, losing your MacBook Pro's Retina display can be a frustrating and expensive experience. But using an external monitor can help you carry on your work until you find a permanent solution. And sometimes, in the most miraculous of ways, the Retina display might just come back to life.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi all,
We had a cracked LCD on this model but still had 80-90% working display on the screen.  We replaced the LCD, and screen was completely black.  Assumed it was defective, so we ordered a replacement and installed.. and again no display.
We tested the HDMI display and got a perfect signal... computer is working great.
I can believe that we received two defective LCD's in a row, but I find this highly unlikely.  Any other ideas?

 Best advise here is to order the correct part.

 My father had the same problem with his Macbook Pro. I fixed it just by turning it on and letting him typ in his password. I believe after that it just fixed itself (it's been a while since it happened). Maybe try changing the brightness of the screen after logging in. I don't know if this will work for your clients Macbook but I hope it does.
