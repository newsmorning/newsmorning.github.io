# Say Goodbye to Frustration! Learn How to Fix Your 3DR Solo Phone Holder in Minutes with this Easy Repair Guide!

The 3DR Solo Drone is a powerful and versatile tool that enables users to capture stunning aerial footage from a wide range of angles. One of the key features of the 3DR Solo is its phone holder, which enables pilots to connect their smartphones to the drone to view live video feeds and control the camera.

However, over time, the phone holder can become loose or even break, causing frustration and inconvenience for pilots. If you're experiencing issues with your 3DR Solo phone holder, don't worry â€“ with our easy repair guide, you can learn how to fix it in just a few minutes!

## Step 1: Gather the Necessary Tools and Materials

Before you start the repair process, you'll need to gather a few tools and materials. You'll need a small Phillips head screwdriver, a set of pliers, and a replacement phone holder (which can be purchased online).

## Step 2: Remove the Old Phone Holder

The first step in fixing your 3DR Solo phone holder is to remove the old one. Start by removing the four screws that hold the phone holder in place, using your Phillips head screwdriver. Once the screws are removed, gently lift the phone holder out of the drone's base.

## Step 3: Replace the Phone Holder

Next, take your replacement phone holder and align it with the holes in the drone's base. Once the holder is in place, use your Phillips head screwdriver to attach it securely to the base with the four screws. Use a set of pliers to tighten the screws, ensuring that the phone holder is firmly attached to the drone.

## Step 4: Test the Phone Holder

Now that your new phone holder is securely in place, it's time to test it out. Connect your smartphone to the holder to ensure that it fits snugly and securely. Test the connection by viewing the live video feed and controlling the camera. If everything is working properly, you're all done!

## In Conclusion

Fixing your 3DR Solo phone holder is a quick and easy repair that can save you a lot of frustration and hassle in the long run. By following these simple steps, you can have your drone up and running again in just a few minutes. Happy flying!
