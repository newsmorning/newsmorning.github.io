# I Thought My iPhone 4S was a Goner After Dropping it in Water... But What Happened Next Will Shock You!

It was a typical Friday evening, and I was out with my friends, having a good time. As we were walking back to our cars, I reached into my pocket to check my phone, but it wasn't there. Panic set in as I realized that I must have dropped it somewhere along the way. We searched everywhere, but to no avail. It wasn't until I heard a faint ringing sound that we finally found my phone - at the bottom of a nearby fountain.

My heart sank as I picked up my iPhone 4S, which was now soaking wet. I knew that water damage was one of the worst things that could happen to a phone. I tried turning it on, but to no avail, the screen remained black. I thought that was it, my phone was done for, and I had to buy a new one.

I was devastated, and as I went home, I dreaded telling my family what had happened. I hesitantly put my phone on the kitchen counter, and left it there to dry overnight. When I woke up the following morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see my phone still on the counter, looking much better than I had anticipated.

I finally got the courage to turn it on, hoping for the best but expecting the worst. Much to my amazement, it turned on, and the screen displayed a message saying that it needed to connect to iTunes - this was indeed a good sign! I immediately plugged it in, and within minutes, my phone was back to its former glory.

I was shocked and amazed that my iPhone 4S had survived such an ordeal. In the end, it seemed that all it needed was some time to dry out completely before it could be brought back to life. I'm grateful for this experience, as it taught me the importance of being careful with my phone, and not to take it for granted.

In conclusion, dropping your phone in water can be a terrifying experience, but don't give up hope just yet! With patience and the proper care, your phone could come back to life, just like mine did. Always be mindful of your phone and take every precaution to make sure you never have to go through this ordeal again.

## Chosen Solution
 hi .my iphone was droped on water and i try to fix it by open the phone and dry it and clean it but after that when I try to turn the phone on its stuck on the logo apple and turn off and turn on and doing that all the time .what I can do

 Ziko link  you are not telling us how and what you cleaned. The first thing I suggest is that you disassemble the phone using these guides. Then clean the phone with +90% isopropyl alcohol. Use this guide to clean it. After you have everything properly cleaned, replace the battery Reassemble your phone and re-evaluate. Once you do all that let us know what you found out. Hope this helps, good luck.
