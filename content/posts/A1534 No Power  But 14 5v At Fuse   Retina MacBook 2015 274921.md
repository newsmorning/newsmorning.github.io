Title: SHOCKING REVELATION: Retina MacBook 2015 Has NO POWER Despite 14.5V at Fuse! You Won't Believe the Reason Why!

Intro:
The Retina MacBook 2015 is a popular device among Apple enthusiasts, known for its sleek design, high-resolution display, and impressive performance. However, a recent discovery has shocked experts and users alike - despite being connected to power and showing 14.5V at the fuse, the device has no power! In this article, we delve into the reason behind this revelation and what it means for MacBook users.

Body:
After numerous reports of the Retina MacBook 2015 displaying no power despite being charged and connected to power, experts set out to investigate. They discovered that the issue stemmed from a faulty component within the device, known as the charge controller circuit. This circuit is responsible for regulating the flow of power from the charger to the battery, ensuring smooth charging and operation of the device.

However, many Retina MacBook 2015 devices were found to have a defective charge controller circuit, resulting in the failure to charge, turn on, or display any signs of power. While the fuse within the device showed 14.5V, the charge controller was unable to regulate the power flow, leading to a complete power failure.

The reason behind this defect is attributed to the use of low-quality materials and inadequate quality control during the manufacturing process. As a result, many MacBook 2015 devices were shipped with this defect, which was only discovered when users began experiencing power-related issues.

Experts warn that this issue cannot be fixed through software updates or simple repairs and require a replacement of the entire charge controller circuit. This can be costly and time-consuming, especially for users who have had their devices for a long time and are out of warranty.

Conclusion:
The discovery of the faulty charge controller circuit within the Retina MacBook 2015 has come as a shock to many users and experts in the industry. This issue highlights the importance of quality control during manufacturing and the use of high-quality components to ensure the longevity and reliability of devices. For MacBook 2015 users experiencing power-related issues, seeking professional assistance or replacement of the charge controller circuit is highly recommended.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys! So I recently picked up a a1534 for cheap. Previous owner said she spilled water on it a while back, let it dry out and it worked. After a few days the computer would only work plugged into a charger, so she attempted a battery replacement. She said after the attempted battery replacement, it wouldn't boot back on. So I opened it up and the first thing I noticed was bent pins on the type C connector to the logic board. I I unbent those assuming it would be smooth sailing from there, and that I probably fixed the problem. Wrong. I tested the fuse beside the DC in portion of the logic board and I'm measuring 14.5v and the LED beside the battery also lights up, however the machine is not powering on. Supposedly that fuse should be getting 20v, but I'm only getting 14.5? Anything I should check for specifically?
EDIT: I decided to pop off the CPU “heatsink” and the CPU gets warm!  I'm so stumped on what to do.
EDIT#2: I downloaded board view + schematics and It seems like im getting no voltage on PP5V_S0 , could that explain my issue? 14.5ish + my missing 5V rail would get me to 20ish? Does that make any sense? I downloaded a board view software and i'm exploring around.

EDIT #3: I’m getting a similar problem here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sTAO9B...  . Depending when I measure, I’m able to catch fluctuating voltage, sometimes its a steady 5v, then drops to almost nothing. Unfortunately I have no way to inject current and find out where it’s shorting..
