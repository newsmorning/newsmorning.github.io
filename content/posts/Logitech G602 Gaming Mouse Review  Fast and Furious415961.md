We purchased the Logitech G602 Gaming Mouse so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

The Logitech G602 Gaming Mouse takes the performance and convenience of a gaming mouse and manages to pack it into a comfortable design that can be moved around your desk without the need for wires. It doesn’t have RGB like most modern gaming accessories, but that could be a selling point if you prefer a subtle, somewhat more professional look. 

 
##   Design: Everything you need and more  
 

Logitech has a rather refined style when it comes to mice and the G602 is no exception. It’s mostly black with gunmetal accents and features various patterns and finishes across various surfaces to aid grip and feel. This is a contrast to other gaming mice that tend to have sharp angles, brightly colored accents, and RGB lighting. The G602 looks less flashy and more professional, which could be a big selling point if you want to use it in the office too. 

 

Beyond the standard scroll wheel and left/right mouse buttons, the mouse features eleven customizable buttons along the left-hand side of the mouse, where the thumb rest is. This layout makes it easy to assign various game actions and macros to the buttons and activate them with a quick flick of the thumb. In our time with the mouse, we noticed the rearmost buttons on the thumb rest were a bit difficult to quickly activate at times, but once we got the hang of it we were able to adjust our grip on the fly. 

 

An unseen design element of the mouse is the ability to adjust the weight and feel of the mouse by deciding how many batteries to put inside and on what side to place them. If you like a heavier feel, you can run the mouse with two batteries, but it’s also possible to run off just one battery on the side of your choosing to account for weight distribution. Of course, using a single battery drops battery life by half, but having it as an option is nice. 

 
The thumb rest also keeps your thumb off the desk surface and provides a better grip on the mouse as a whole, which is nice in those heated gaming moments.
 

Another small detail is that the right mouse button is slightly longer than the left mouse button to account for the fact that, generally speaking, a person’s middle-finger is longer than their index finger. It might seem insignificant, but in our experience, this small detail added a fair bit of additional comfort that many other mice don’t account for.  

 
##   Setup Process: Fast and easy  
 

Setting up the Logitech G602 starts with plugging in the included 2.4GHz wireless receiver. Rather than standard Bluetooth, this receiver is designed specifically to reduce lag to the absolute minimum. The receiver plugs into any USB-A port and instantly pairs with the mouse once one or two AA batteries have been put inside the mouse.

 

By default, the scroll wheel and left/right mouse buttons work as expected. The two silver G10 and G11 buttons adjust the sensitivity of the mouse by default and the resulting sensitivity is displayed using three LEDs on the left-hand side of the mouse. These two buttons—and the remaining nine near the thumb rest—can be programmed with Logitech Gaming Software, which we’ll address below. 

 
##   Wireless: Not a hiccup in sight  
 

The Logitech G602 Gaming Mouse relies on a dedicated connection with the included 2.4GHz receiver and lacks standard Bluetooth connectivity, meaning the mouse can only operate with the included receiver. We tested the G602 on both macOS and Windows computers and even when using other Logitech wireless peripherals running off 2.4GHz receivers, we didn’t notice any interference or hiccups. 

 
##   Performance: Gamers rise up   
 

The G602 uses Logitech’s proprietary Delta Zero laser sensor, which is designed to offer optimal performance without sacrificing battery life. Its Dot Per Inch (a measure of mouse sensitivity) settings range between 250 DPI to 2500 DPI. It can be quickly switched through five presets using the aforementioned G10 and G11 buttons on the left-hand side of the mouse. 

 

Now, 2500 DPI is far from the top of the line when it comes to more modern gaming mice, but in the more than 50 hours we spent with the mouse playing everything from Fortnite to Skyrim, we never felt as though it wasn’t enough for accuracy. Not to mention the ability to adjust sensitivity on-the-fly was an underrated benefit for those times when you need more precision—especially when looking through scopes or making micro-adjustments in first-person shooter games.

 

The nine customizable buttons on the thumb rest of the mouse also proved to be a great inclusion, as it made cycling through weapons and macros extremely convenient and also made it possible to open up additional macros on the keyboard for even more in-game control. As mentioned above, it was difficult to distinguish the different buttons on the side of the mouse at first, but with enough practice and time, it became possible to quickly tap the right button, even in the heat of battle.

Our G602 came with two AA batteries out of the box. While we played around with the weight difference and balance between using two batteries versus one, we ultimately went through most of our testing with two batteries, as we liked the heavier feel of the mouse. Logitech rates the batteries for up to 250 hours in Performance mode. While we hit 60 or so hours, the mouse showed no signs of slowing down. Furthermore, if you use the switch on the top of the mouse, you can change the G602 to Endurance mode, which will sacrifice a bit of precision for upwards of 1,440 hours of use. If the top display on the mouse is blue, you know you’re in Performance mode, while a green light indicates Endurance mode. 

 
##   Comfort: Long gaming sessions aren’t a problem  
 

Gaming mice should be comfortable in every sense of the word and the G602 manages to tick all the boxes. The left/right mouse buttons are long, with a large surface area to click. The scroll wheel is nice and tactile, and the customizable buttons on the side of the mouse add additional convenience. The thumb rest also keeps your thumb off the desk surface and provides a better grip on the mouse as a whole, which is nice in those heated gaming moments. 

 
##   Software: Plenty of room to customize for your playing style  
 

Logitech Gaming Software, which can be downloaded via Logitech’s website, works with the G602 and other Logitech gaming peripherals to help check the status of the devices, upgrade the firmware when possible, and customize the various buttons. Once downloaded, the software will automatically recognize when a device is connected via the receiver. Once recognized, you can click through the various menus to adjust everything from the predetermined DPI presets to creating game-specific macros and shortcuts for the eleven customizable buttons.

We spent probably four hours creating custom setups for the various games we tested the mouse with and without fail, the Logitech Gaming Software recognized what game we had live and would automatically switch the control profiles accordingly. It’s a great program that provides almost limitless customization and the best part is it works seamlessly with other Logitech gaming hardware to help create a cohesive experience.

 
##   Price: Costly, but worth it  
 

Logitech lists the G602 for $79.99. Even for a gaming mouse, that’s a bit high (especially considering the mouse was released in 2013), but you’re paying for the convenience of wireless. It’s also worth keeping in mind that the mouse is often on sale, so you can sometimes find it for below $40 which is a steal. If you don’t mind an additional cable on your desk, you’re probably better off going with a wired mouse, as you’ll easily find more advanced features at a similar or lesser price, but if the lack of wires is a necessity, it’s a small price to pay for that long-term convenience.

 
##   Competition: Mid-range wireless gaming mice are few and far between  
 

The Logitech G602 Gaming Mouse is an impressive device, but it’s been over five years since its original release and in that time plenty of competitors have come along. The two most similar competitors are the Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse and the Razer Mamba Wireless Gaming Mouse.

 

The Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse is a newer, more minimal mouse compared to the G602. It features only two customizable buttons and lacks the more ergonomic design of the G602, but offers a much higher resolution of 12000 DPI with a super-fast 1ms response time, compared to the 2ms response time of the G602. At $59.99, it’s even cheaper, which is impressive considering it was released in 2018. 

 

Moving away from Logitech, the Razer Mamba Wireless Gaming Mouse also serves as a worthwhile opponent. It further boosts the resolution up to 16000 DPI and also throws in seven programmable buttons. However, its 50-hour battery life and $99.99 price tag make it a little less enticing though its specs might tease.
