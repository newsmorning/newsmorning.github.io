Revive Your Apple Watch Series 3 with a Simple LCD Replacement - No More Broken or Lost Displays!

Apple Watch is a device that has revolutionized the world of smartwatches. The Apple Watch Series 3, in particular, is an excellent device that is perfect for fitness enthusiasts as it tracks your workouts, heart rate, and even your sleep. However, one problem users face is a broken or lost LCD display. This can be frustrating as it renders the watch unusable. Fortunately, the solution is simple - a replacement LCD. 

The process of replacing the LCD display on your Apple Watch Series 3 is not complicated, and it can be done easily following the steps below.

Before beginning the LCD replacement process, you will need to gather some tools. You'll need a Pentalobe screwdriver, a tri-point screwdriver, a suction cup, and a spudger tool. These tools are essential as they will help you dismantle the watch.

Step 1: Power Off Your Apple Watch

Before you start, turn off your Apple Watch by pressing and holding the side button until the Power Off slider appears. Swipe the slider to turn off your Apple Watch.

Step 2: Remove the Display

Using the suction cup, press and hold it on the display of your Apple Watch Series 3. Pull the cup up, and the display will start to lift. Next, insert the spudger tool and gently pry the display from the watch. Be careful not to damage any of the cables that connect the display to the watch.

Step 3: Remove the Battery

After removing the display, you will need to remove the battery. Using the spudger tool, pry out the battery from its slot gently. You should be extra careful while doing this as any damage to the battery could cause serious problems in the watch.

Step 4: Remove the Screws

Using the Pentalobe screwdriver, remove the six screws that hold the metal cover. Once the screws are removed, use the spudger tool to gently pry out the cover.

Step 5: Remove the LCD

After removing the metal cover, you will now be able to remove the LCD from the watch. Using the tri-point screwdriver, remove the four screws that secure the LCD. Once removed, you can now remove the LCD from the watch.

Step 6: Install the New LCD

At this point, you can install the new LCD into the watch. Make sure you follow the steps in reverse order. This means first installing the new LCD and then securing it with the four screws using the tri-point screwdriver. Then, replace the metal cover and secure it with the six screws using the Pentalobe screwdriver. 

Step 7: Reattach the Battery and Display

Once the new LCD is installed, you can reattach the battery and display. This is done by simply aligning the connectors of the battery and the display with the watch's connectors and pushing them in.

In conclusion, broken or lost LCD displays on Apple Watch Series 3 can be frustrating, but there is no need to buy a new device. A simple LCD replacement can do the trick. The process is straightforward and can be done quickly with the right tools. With these steps, you'll be able to revive your Apple Watch Series 3 in no time, no more broken or lost displays!
