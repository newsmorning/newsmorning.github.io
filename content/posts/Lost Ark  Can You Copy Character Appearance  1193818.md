# Discover the Controversial Truth: Can You Steal Character Appearance in Lost Ark?!

As one of the newest massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) in the market, Lost Ark has already gained a lot of attention and players around the world. However, there has been a controversial question among the Lost Ark community lately: can you steal character appearance in the game? In this article, we will explore both sides of the argument and try to find the truth about this matter.

First, let's understand what character appearance means in Lost Ark. In this game, players can customize their characters in various aspects, including hairstyle, face shape, skin tone, and even eyebrows. After creating a unique-looking character, players can explore the game's world and fight monsters or other players in epic battles. Some players have spent hours or even days perfecting their character appearance to look as cool, beautiful, or funny as possible.

Now, let's jump to the controversy. Some players have claimed that it is possible to steal other players' character appearance in Lost Ark. How? Apparently, by using a third-party software called "appearance extractor," which can capture the visual data of any player's character and reproduce it in another player's game client. This means that a player could see someone else's character, use the appearance extractor, and copy that character's appearance without their permission.

On the one hand, some players argue that this is a major flaw in Lost Ark's security and can lead to unfair advantages or even bullying among players. Imagine a group of players copying the appearance of another player and harassing them wherever they go, making it difficult for that player to enjoy the game. Moreover, if a player spent money on in-game items to enhance their character appearance, it would be frustrating to see someone else stealing it for free.

On the other hand, some players claim that stealing character appearance is not a big issue in Lost Ark, and it could even be considered a feature of the game. After all, there is no way to prevent other players from seeing your character in public areas or during battles. Moreover, some players enjoy the challenge of creating the best-looking character and feel proud when others copy it. Some players have even created communities where they share or sell their character appearance for others to use.

So, what is the truth about stealing character appearance in Lost Ark? The answer is not black or white but rather a matter of perspective. Yes, it is possible to steal character appearance using third-party software, and some players might use it to their advantage or detriment of others. However, it is also true that character appearance is not a private or exclusive aspect of the game, and some players might find it entertaining or rewarding to share or copy it.

In the end, Lost Ark's developers could take different measures to address this issue, such as improving the game's security, providing more customization options, or embracing the community aspect of character appearance. Until then, it is up to each player to decide how to approach this controversy and enjoy the game without compromising their integrity or creativity. Let's play fair and have fun!

Lost Ark has released in NA/EU now and players are ecstatic to experience the world of Arkesia. There’s a lot that this game offers right from in-depth character customization to boss fights, ship upgrades and more. If you have played the beta versions, you might be wondering if there’s any way to copy those character customization preset settings and bring them into the release version? Find out more about it here.
 
## Can you Copy Character Customization Preset Settings in Lost Ark?
 
If you have saved your character customization settings from the NA, EU beta or Kor/Jap/Rus version, here’s how to copy them and carry them over into the release version of the game. Make sure that you keep the original files saved as a backup in case things go wrong.
 
- Copy the \EFGame\Customizing folder from the beta client and paste it into \steam\steamapps\common\Lost Ark\EFGame\Customizing. It should be a .cus file.
 - Doing this will help you get the presets for your character in Lost Ark.

 
(Thanks to Blackbane on Lost Ark Forum for this info.)
 
If you would like to use your Kor/Jap/Rus files, all you have to do is edit the .cus file via notepad and type USA instead of KOR/JAP/RUS. (Thanks to Monke on Lost Ark Forum and u/pikmim3 on Reddit for sharing.)
 
Important: Now, it seems that this is working for a few players and for some, the game is crashing. User Alcad says – Fair warning. I’ve heard from several people that they completely changed the presets for certain faces and hairs for NA from RU and such, so it’s entirely possible that your RU preset will be broken or just entirely not working if you import it into NA client.
 
If things don’t work out as expected, revert the changes and use the original files that you have backed up which have no edits. If you feel like you are okay with taking the risk, go ahead and follow the aforementioned steps. Otherwise, you can simply remake the character customization manually.
