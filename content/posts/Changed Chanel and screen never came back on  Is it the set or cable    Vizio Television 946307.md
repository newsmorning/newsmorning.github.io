# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed My Channel On My Vizio Television! Screen Went Blank - Is It The Set Or Cable?

I had just settled down to watch my favorite show on my Vizio television when I decided to change the channel. However, to my surprise, my screen went blank! At first, I thought it must have been the cable or channel that had caused the issue. However, upon further investigation, I found out that it was simply a glitch in my television set.

If you find yourself facing a similar situation, don't worry, there are some simple steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem.

Firstly, try restarting your television set. You can do this by turning off the set and leaving it unplugged for at least 30 seconds before plugging it back in and turning it on. If this doesn't work, you can try resetting your television to its default settings by accessing the "System Reset" option in the settings menu.

Another thing to consider is the connection between your cable box and your television set. If the cable is not properly connected, it may cause the screen to go blank. To fix this, check the cable connections and make sure that they are secure.

If all else fails, it may be time to call in a professional. Contact the manufacturer or a reputable repair service to help diagnose and fix the issue.

In conclusion, if your screen goes blank when changing a channel on your Vizio television, there is no need to panic. It is most likely a simple glitch that can be remedied with some basic troubleshooting steps. If the problem persists, seek professional help to get your television back up and running again.

## Chosen Solution
 Changed Chanel, tv went black, picture never came back on. I would assume it is the 5 yr old set but have never had one go bad. Could it be cable co.  dvr box?  Thanks!

 @wynglasses at this point anything is possible. Disconnect everything, disconnect the TV and all inputs. Then push and hold the power button for a few minutes. Now plug it in turn the set on. See if that reset it. Only connect one input i.e. DVD player  or reg coax etc. do not connect more than one input at the time. If it still doesn't work then you may have an issue with your power board/t-con board etc. For that you will have to remove the back off your TV and look at the boards. Make sure that all cable connectors are properly seated (make sure that your set unplugged and do not touch anything with your hands yet;-)Check to see if there are any obviously damaged components like bulging or leaking capacitors etc. Post some good images of your boards with your question so that we can see what you see.
