Memory 384 MB SCRAM
Machine Model:PowerBook3,1
CPU Type: PowerPC 750 (83.0)
Bus speed 100MHz

One problem I've come across is that when I went to check for updates it asks me to login my passwaord??? as there are update it wants.I came across a couple of things on the internet as I couldn't find anything about it here and wondered if i should try them.
The first one I couldn't find the link to so I've just copy it to here for you to check out to see if I'm on the right path :)
Recover Apple Mac Keychain password
Posted by hsukumar on 15/04/2009
Go to your home folder, find the Library folder and drag the Library>Keychains folder to the trash.
Restart the computer and a new keychain will be created using your current system password.
If you have forgotten you whole system password then you will need to reset it using your System Restore disk
Is your “Keychain password” the same as your “Administrator password”, the one you use to install software? Or do you have a user account a Mac OS X machine where someone else is the system administrator?
If you’re the administrator and you’ve forgotten the password to the login keychain and the administrator password, I am afraid you’ve permanently lost the contents of your keychain. However, you can recover from the situation without reinstalling the entire OS.
First, reset the administrator password using the Mac OS X disc:
1.    Insert the Mac OS X Install disc and restart the computer.
2.    When you hear the startup tone, hold down the C key until you see the spinning gear.
3.    When the Installer appears, choose Utilities > Reset Password.
4.    Follow the onscreen instructions to change the password.
5.    Quit the Installer and restart your computer while holding down the mouse button to eject the disc.
After the Mac has restarted, you’d normally now need to change the password for the keychain called “login” to match the new admin password, but since you’ve forgotten it you’ll need to delete the old login keychain. Do the following steps:
1.    Open Keychain Access, located in /Applications/Utilities.
2.    Choose Keychain List from the Edit menu.
3.    Select the “login” keychain.
4.    Click Delete (the “-” button).
The login keychain will now be empty. The next time the keychain is needed you’ll have to manually enter the appropriate password and then you’ll be asked if you want to store the password in the keychain

Thanks again guys :)))
Looking forward to hearing from you soon
