If you own a Hisense Chromebook, then you might have experienced some issues with your device. Over the past few years, many user reports have suggested that some Chromebooks, including Hisense models, are prone to experiencing problems with Chrome OS. For those who are not familiar with Chrome OS, it is the operating system that runs on Chromebooks. It is designed by Google to be lightweight, fast, and secure, and it allows users to access a range of web-based applications.

However, if your Chromebook is missing or damaged Chrome OS, then your device may become dysfunctional or even unusable. In this article, we will discuss the shocking truth about missing or damaged Chrome OS on Hisense Chromebooks and what you can do to fix the issue.

The Common Symptoms of Missing or Damaged Chrome OS on Hisense Chromebooks

The most common sign of a missing or damaged Chrome OS on your Hisense Chromebook is that it won't start up properly. You will see a black screen or a message displaying an error code. Your device may also get stuck in a boot loop where it keeps restarting continuously without successfully booting up. Another indication of a missing or damaged Chrome OS is when your Chromebook is unable to update itself, which means it won't receive any new security patches, features, or bug fixes.

What Causes Chrome OS to Be Missing or Damaged on Hisense Chromebooks?

Chrome OS is a lightweight and efficient operating system, but it can still have issues that cause it to go missing or become damaged. The most common reasons for the problem are:

## 1. Failed Updates

Chrome OS needs regular updates to function correctly, and sometimes these updates can fail. Failed updates can leave your Chromebook without critical files, making it impossible to boot up properly.

## 2. Hardware Issues

Due to poor manufacturing or wear and tear, some Hisense Chromebooks may encounter issues with hardware components. For example, a faulty hard drive, RAM, or motherboard can cause your Chromebook to lose Chrome OS information or not start.

## 3. Power Interruption

Power disruption during an update or any other process that involves writing critical system files to the internal storage can lead to the loss or corruption of such files.

What Can You Do To Fix The Issue?

If you are experiencing issues with missing or damaged Chrome OS on your Hisense Chromebook, there are several solutions you can try. Here are some of the most effective methods:

## 1. Powerwash Your Chromebook

Powerwashing is the process of resetting your Chromebook to its factory default settings. It can often fix issues caused by software corruption or failed updates. To initiate a powerwash, launch the Chromebook recovery utility, follow the instructions, and select "erase all data."

## 2. Reinstall Chrome OS

If powerwashing does not solve the issue, you can try reinstalling Chrome OS manually. To do this, you will need to create a Chrome OS recovery USB drive with another computer and use it to reinstall the operating system on your Hisense Chromebook. You can find detailed instructions on Google's Chrome OS support page.

## 3. Contact Hisense Support

If the above methods do not work, the next step is to contact Hisense's customer support team for assistance. They will guide you through the troubleshooting process, and if needed, they might suggest taking your device to a certified repair center for further diagnosis.

Conclusion

Missing or damaged Chrome OS on a Hisense Chromebook can cause significant problems, but fortunately, there are several solutions available. Powerwashing, reinstalling Chrome OS, and contacting Hisense support are some of the most effective methods. It is essential to stay up-to-date with your Chromebook's updates and handle it with care to prevent hardware issues. By following these tips, you can enjoy using your Hisense Chromebook without any hindrance.

## Chosen Solution
 I try to reboot my Hisense Chromebook c11 when I hit esc, refresh, and power, it says "Chrome OS is missing or damaged. Pleas insert a recovery USB stick or SD card. " When I hit tab, it also says 0x02 recovery button pressed. To reboot I hit ctrl D and i hit enter, I hit tab again and it says 0x00 / 0x00 recovery not requested. After it beeps twice it goes black and wont turn back on again until I hit esc, refresh, and power again. If anyone knows whats happening please tell me.

 You need to download the Chrome Recovery Utility app on another working computer with the Chrome browser (this can be a Windows or Mac, doesn't matter as long as it's Chrome). You can find it in the Chrome app store. If you don't have another computer, ask a friend.
Then you'll need a SD card and reader, or a thumbdrive. DO NOT USE SANDISK BRAND. They do not work. (I know, because I tried and had to go buy a different brand of thumbdisk. Don't know why, but Sandisk does not work with Chrome Recovery Utility).
On the working computer, open up the app in Chrome, and follow the on-screen instructions. You'll need your Chromebook's serial number to set up the recovery disk. Your Chromebook should display it as a part of the error message. One the disk is prepared, you'll need to insert the disk into your Chromebook, and let it do it's thing.
I LITERALLY just had this happen to me on Tuesday this week (7.8.16) with my Hisense Chromebook, so I know this works. I've had mine for a year and it's developed a glitchy battery. Think this caused an improper shutdown and a memory issue to occur, resulting in the OS error.
Good luck!
