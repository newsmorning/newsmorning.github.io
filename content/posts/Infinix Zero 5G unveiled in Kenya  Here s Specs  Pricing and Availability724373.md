Transsion’s products are pretty popular in Africa and as the company works to extend its reach to other markets, users can expect even better products from the associated brands like Infinix, Tecno, and iTel.
 
5G is also slowly taking shape with more and more carriers in the continent hopping onto the hype train. Locally, Safaricom is aggressively rolling out and expanding coverage for 5G, much to the delight of its customers.
 
Not too long ago, we saw reports that Infinix was working on its first-ever 5G-capable device but at the time, it was unclear which lineup this device would be part of.
 
Well now it is official, the rumored device is the Infinix Zero 5G. 
 
## Infinix Zero 5G Specifications
 
Of course, the Zero 5G comes with 5G support courtesy of the Dimensity 900 that powers the whole contraption. Keeping the device alive is a 5000mAh battery cell.
 
The Zero 5G’s design is perhaps the most striking feature. The device sports a design akin to what we saw with the OnePlus 9 devices which means an all-glass body with a camera array that is raised above the rear back courtesy of a curve in the back panel.
 
In the camera department, Zero 5G has a 48-megapixel main lens, along with a 13-megapixel telephoto, and a third AI Depth sensor. A 16 MP selfie shooter is also present.
 
## Pricing and Availability
 
In the markets that the Inifnix Zero 5G is officially rolling out, the device is going for a rather reasonable $300. For a 5G device, this is an absolute bargain seeing as the other devices with support for this next-gen network for upwards of $500.
 
The device should soon be available across major retail stores in the country and on Jumi and other e-commerce sites so be on the lookout for these listings soon.
 
Could this mean that we are finally seeing a reduction in the ‘early-adopters tax’ for 5G? Does this mean that we will soon be seeing more 5G devices at fairer pricetags? Only time will tell.
