# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Activate My Apple Watch Series 5 - The Previous Owner Still Had Control!

I recently purchased an Apple Watch Series 5 online and was excited to activate it and start using all its cool features.

However, things didn't go according to plan when I realized that the previous owner still had control over the watch!

After several frustrating attempts to activate it with my Apple ID, I reached out to Apple support for help. They informed me that the previous owner had not disconnected their iCloud account from the watch, which meant that they still had control over it.

This was surprising and alarming. I had assumed that resetting the watch would remove all previous data and accounts associated with it. But that was not the case.

To solve the issue, I had to contact the previous owner and ask them to disconnect their account from the watch. It was a hassle, but eventually, they did as I requested.

This experience taught me an important lesson about buying used Apple products. Always ensure that the previous owner has disconnected their iCloud account before making a purchase. Otherwise, you might find yourself in a similar situation as mine.

Apple implements these security measures to prevent theft and ensure that their devices remain secure. Therefore, it is essential to take them seriously and follow the guidelines strictly.

Overall, I learned the importance of being careful when purchasing used Apple devices as they may come with unexpected complications. Make sure to double-check everything before making payment to avoid issues down the line.

In conclusion, buying a second-hand Apple device can be a cost-effective way to upgrade your tech. However, make sure to follow the correct steps to ensure you don't run into issues like those I encountered with my Apple Watch Series 5. Always proceed with caution, and you'll be able to take full advantage of your new device without any problems.

## Chosen Solution
 I’ve purchased a Apple Watch 5 and it’s connected to the previous owner that I now can contact how the !&&* can I find out the connected account or over side this? So annoying

 hello Tracey,
this is like an icloud lock and cannot be removed without the help of a prior user. Often times, iPhones are sold with this kind of lock and turn out to be mostly stolen or missing devices. Contact the previous owner to have them disconnect from their iPhone or (if you purchased via ebay) initiate a dispute and return the device.

 You have to contact the previous owner, tell them to remove the Apple Watch from their iCloud account. That is the only solution or the device is basically unusable
