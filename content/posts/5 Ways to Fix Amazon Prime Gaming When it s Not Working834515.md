This could be due to several reasons but the most common is still regional restrictions. Prime Gaming is not available in all countries yet, and if you reside in one of these, it wouldn’t work. Other than that, problems with the payment or using a VPN too can lead to the issue.
 
## Is Prime Video and Prime Gaming the same?
 
 
 
Browse the web from multiple devices with increased security protocols.
 
Access content across the globe at the highest speed rate.
 
Connect to thousands of servers for persistent seamless browsing.
 
While Prime Video is a streaming service where users can watch thousands of movies and series, Prime Gaming offers a plethora of game titles and in-game content to choose from. Also, in Prime Gaming, the games that were claimed remain accessible even if the Prime subscription ends.
 
### 1. Verify Prime Gaming is available in your country
 
If the screen reads, It looks like you’re in an unsupported country, you wouldn’t be able to access the games. Here, all you can do is wait and hope that Prime Gaming soon comes to your country or region. 
 
⇒ Get Private Internet Access
 
### 2. Check the payment method
 
In this case, a simple solution would be to add some money to your card or bank account, as the case may be. If the problem persists, try using a different card altogether. Also, there are certain restrictions on prepaid cards, so it’s best that you avoid using one.
 
### 3. Disable the VPN
 
If you are using a third-party VPN to bypass regional restrictions or access titles available in another country, chances are that it’s the VPN behind the problem. 
 
If Prime Gaming is available in your country, disable the VPN and try accessing the platform directly. In case you relied on a VPN to enhance the performance, try using an effective game booster software.

There are a bunch of ways you can do so by modifying the system settings or uninstalling applications. Also, try updating the network drivers. If these methods don’t work, you are left with no option but to upgrade the Internet plan to switch to a more reliable ISP.
 
### Can you use Prime Gaming on mobile?
