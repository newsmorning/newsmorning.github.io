Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed My Macbook Air Battery! Only Charges to 22%??

Introduction:

My trusty Macbook Air has been my go-to device for work and personal use for over five years now. I’ve noticed that its battery life hasn’t been holding up as well as it used to, so I decided to replace the old battery with a brand new one. However, when I installed the new battery, I was shocked to discover that it only charges to 22% and no higher. I delved into the problem and found out the issue I was dealing with. Read on to find out the whole story.

Background:

Before I proceed, let me give you a little background about the device in question. The Macbook Air model I own comes with an integrated battery, meaning it’s not removable from the device. Therefore, to replace the battery, I had to take apart the lower case, the touchpad, and the battery.

The experience:

When I replaced the old battery with the new one, I initially didn’t see any issues. The device powered on, and I started using it right away. But as soon as I plugged it in to charge, I noticed that it wouldn’t charge past 22%. This was certainly not what I had expected.

I searched online for solutions and quickly discovered that I was not alone in this. Other users had run into the same issue when replacing their Macbook Air batteries. Some believed it was due to faulty battery cells, while others believed it was a software-related issue.

Solution:

After conducting some research, I discovered that the issue was not with the battery but rather with calibration. When a new battery is installed, the device needs to calibrate it to maximize its efficiency. Sometimes the battery gauge doesn't calibrate correctly, resulting in the device charging only to a certain percentage.

The solution to this issue was surprisingly simple. All I needed to do was reset the System Management Controller (SMC) using a specific key combination. SMC reset helps to clear the power management settings and recalibrate the battery gauge. I followed the instructions given, and after resetting the SMC, my Macbook Air started charging perfectly without any issues. It now holds a full charge of about 10 hours.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, changing your Macbook Air battery can be a relatively easy task, but recalibrating it can be a bit challenging. Any problems such as the one I encountered could be because of calibration issues, and a proper reset of the SMC could solve the problem. I hope this article helps others who may run into similar issues when changing their Macbook Air battery.
