EMERGENCY ALERT: Your iPad Pro 10.5 is in TROUBLE! Home Button not working after installation, MUST READ for help! 

If you're an avid iPad user, you know the importance of having a reliable device. However, sometimes even the most reliable devices can run into issues. One common issue some iPad Pro 10.5 users have encountered is home button dysfunction after installation. If you are facing a similar issue, don't panic! There are a few steps you can take to diagnose and fix the problem. 

First, let's understand the cause of the problem. Often, the problem arises when individuals install a new screen or digitizer on their iPad Pro 10.5. During the installation process, they accidentally damage the home button circuitry, causing the button to become unresponsive. 

To diagnose the problem, you can try performing a few troubleshooting steps. Start by restarting your iPad Pro 10.5 to see if that can resolve the issue. If this method doesn't work, try resetting your device to its factory settings, and re-installing the software. If none of these methods work, it could be a hardware issue requiring professional repair. 

If you've gone through these steps and still have trouble, don't worry! You still have a few options available. One option is to try using an on-screen button as a replacement, though this might not be the best solution for everyone. Another option is to take your device to a professional repair shop, where an expert technician can diagnose and repair the issue for you. 

In summary, iPad Pro 10.5 home button dysfunction is a common issue when installing new equipment. Troubleshooting is possible, but ultimately, seeking professional help may be the best solution. If you're facing this issue, don't hesitate to take action to get your device back in working order.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey recently screen broke found replacement somewhere else since part is not instock. During screen replacement home button was severed so I had to replace as well. Although I know touch ID functions wont work but home button doesnt seem to work at all.  I'm 99.9% install was correct any ideas on why it wont work? Also ipad was reseted  before i installed so I was able to turn on assistive touch. Will I be able to turn on assitive touch again if  I restore to original apple ID which didn't have it on already or will it just be locked out after?

 Hello
If a home button is damaged I mean (print fingers )you can not replace it with new one but the new  home button without Touch ID will work as just home button
Good luck
