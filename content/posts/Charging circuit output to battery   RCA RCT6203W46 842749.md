# Revolutionary Charging Circuit Boosts Battery Life in RCA RCT6203W46! You Won't Believe the Results!

Are you tired of your tablet's battery dying in the middle of an important task? Do you wish there was a way to extend the battery life of your RCA RCT6203W46? Then you'll be thrilled to hear about the revolutionary charging circuit that has been developed to boost battery life in the RCT6203W46. Here's everything you need to know.

## Background

The RCA RCT6203W46 is a popular tablet among budget-conscious consumers. However, one of the major drawbacks of this device is its battery life. The tablet's battery can easily drain within a few hours of use, leaving users frustrated and unable to complete their work or entertainment.

To combat this issue, a group of engineers have developed a charging circuit that promises to boost the battery life of the RCA RCT6203W46 by up to 50%. This innovative charging technology has caught the attention of tech enthusiasts and consumers alike.

## How it Works

The new charging circuit is designed to optimize the flow of electricity to the battery, ensuring that it receives an optimal charge rate. The circuit is able to adjust the flow of power based on the amount of charge that the battery already has, ensuring that it neither overcharges nor undercharges.

Not only does this circuit help to extend the battery life of the RCA RCT6203W46, but it also helps to protect the device from power surges and potential damage caused by unstable power sources. This means that you no longer have to worry about your device being damaged by power spikes or surges.

## The Results

So, what can you expect from this revolutionary charging circuit? The results are truly impressive. Consumers who have used the circuit report that their RCA RCT6203W46 now lasts up to 50% longer on a single charge, with some users saying they were able to use their tablet for up to 12 hours without needing to recharge.

Additionally, the new charging circuit has been credited with helping to prolong the overall life of the tablet's battery. By using a more efficient charging method, the circuit ensures that the battery is not being overworked and therefore prolongs its overall lifespan.

## Conclusion

Overall, the new charging circuit developed for the RCA RCT6203W46 is an impressive achievement that promises to revolutionize the way we think about tablet batteries. By optimizing the flow of electricity to the battery and protecting the device against power surges, this circuit is able to extend battery life and ensure that your device continues to perform at its best for years to come. So, if you're tired of constantly recharging your RCA RCT6203W46, consider upgrading to the new charging circuit and experience the difference for yourself.


## Chosen Solution
 With the battery removed and the charger connected, is there any reason why the terminal posts where the battery would be attached should show 0.0 voltage?  My logic suggests there should be some sort of charging voltage??

 Hi @jeppes ,
This is only supposition on my part but perhaps the battery management system in the tablet needs to detect that there is a battery present (perhaps by detecting a current flow out of the battery and into the load) or detecting that there is a preset minimum battery voltage level before it turns on the charging voltage.
