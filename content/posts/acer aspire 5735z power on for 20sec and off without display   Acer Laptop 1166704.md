There are a few reasons why your Acer Aspire 5735Z laptop shuts off after only 20 seconds without any display. Firstly, it can be due to a power issue.

Check the laptop's cooling system, including the fans and heat sinks, to ensure that they are working properly. If there is an issue with the cooling system, you may need to replace the fans or clean the heat sink.

3. Check the RAM - A damaged or faulty RAM can cause the laptop to shut down. Check the RAM and ensure that it is correctly installed.

4. Perform a Hard Reset - Sometimes, performing a hard reset can fix the problem of the laptop shutting down after 20 seconds. To do a hard reset, remove the battery, unplug the charger, and hold the power button down for 30 seconds. Then, reinsert the battery and plug the charger back in. Try turning the laptop on again.

## Chosen Solution
 my acer apire 5735 switches on for 20 seconds then switches off on its on and on the screen dont show anything

 washington, you might want to give the RAM a good looking over. If the laptop has two sticks remove both then insert one and try to boot up if it does not boot up remove the stick and try the same thing with the other one. Half the time it's faulty RAM that can cause this type of error. Also, you did not make any mention if the fan comes on or i anything has happened to your computer. Also you should get some kind of POST Beep when you remove all the RAM. If you do, at least you know your CPU is doing what it is supposed to do.  Good Luck and let us know how it is going.

 After finding no love on the issue by diligently searching. I proceeded to breakdown the entire laptop and testing as I removed piece by piece. I eventually got a full boot after pulling the CMOS battery. I replaced it for good measure as I had already fully disassembled the laptop. The CMOS battery is the typical CR2032, I only had a CR2025 on hand (it is slimmer, but the negative spring was strong enough to not cause me concern).

Everything works fine now.

 I have the exact same issue as OP, took off the bottom panel and removed both DIMM and still no beep code or post. The cpu fan spins up then stops, the machine appears to power down and then it looks like it tries to boot again as the LEDs come on and the fan spins for a couple seconds before powering down again.

 My dad just fixed mine replaced the ccfl backlight bulb ! Fiddly job
