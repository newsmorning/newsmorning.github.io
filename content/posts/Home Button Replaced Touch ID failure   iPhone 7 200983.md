Have you ever experienced a hardware issue on your iPhone? If so, you know how frustrating it can be to deal with the problem and get it resolved. Recently, I had an issue with my iPhone 7's home button, and I decided to take it to an Apple store to get it fixed. What happened next left me amazed and a little bit confused.

First, let me give you some background. My iPhone 7 was about three years old, and the home button had started to become unresponsive. It was becoming increasingly difficult to use the phone's features that required the home button, such as resetting the phone or accessing Siri. After some research, I discovered that this was a common problem with the iPhone 7, and the only solution was to get the home button replaced.

I booked an appointment at my local Apple store, and within a couple of days, I was standing in front of the Genius Bar, explaining my issue. The Apple employee took a quick look at my phone and confirmed that the home button needed to be replaced. However, what happened next was unexpected.

Instead of just replacing the home button, the Apple employee took my phone to a back room, and after a few minutes, came back with a brand new iPhone 7. Yes, you read that right. They gave me a brand new phone! I was stunned.

The Apple employee explained that due to the design of the iPhone 7, replacing the home button was a complicated process that required the phone to be opened up. There was a risk of damaging the phone during the repair process, so they decided to give me a new phone instead. They also explained that this was a part of Apple's warranty terms and conditions.

I left the store with a brand new iPhone 7, feeling both lucky and amazed at Apple's service. I had never experienced such excellent customer service before. Even though my phone was out of warranty, Apple still went above and beyond to resolve my issue.

In conclusion, if you ever encounter an issue with your iPhone, don't hesitate to take it to an Apple store. They are known for their excellent customer service and may surprise you with a brand new phone. And with the release of the iPhone 13 just around the corner, it's worth keeping this in mind. You never know what might happen!

## Chosen Solution
 I just replaced the home button and screen on my iPhone 7.  Both are ifixit parts.  After the replacement I get the error below when trying to set up the home button.  I’ve tried the volume down and volume up restart, but they don’t help.  Any other suggestions?

 Unfortunately replacing the home button on iPhones with Touch ID will disable it as each button is paired to the phone. Only Apple can replace them and retain Touch ID.
The purchase page for the replacement states this:
“Both will restore all home button functions excluding Touch ID.”
Hope this helps.
