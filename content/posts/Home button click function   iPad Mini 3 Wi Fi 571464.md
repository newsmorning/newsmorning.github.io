But wait, there's more! The Home Button Click also offers some cool shortcuts that can save you time and make your life easier. For example:

## Chosen Solution
 Hello, I am about to replace my iPad mini 3 digitizer but I have an issue with the home button. Maybe something gone wrong during the disassembly process but now I see that the black pin in the middle of home button is missing (see the picture) . This pin is the one that gets in contact with the metal bracket and guarantee the click function. How can I fix this issue? Do I have to replace the home button with a new one?

 The easiest way to fix it would be to replace the button. Youâ€™ll just lose TouchID. But if you want to maintain that, some skilled micro soldering techs can fix that little button.
