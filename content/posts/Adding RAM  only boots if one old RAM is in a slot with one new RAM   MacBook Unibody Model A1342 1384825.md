Are you on a budget but still want to upgrade your Macbook's RAM for better performance? Well, you're in luck because there is a secret trick that not many people know about that can help you get the most out of your upgrade.

The trick is to combine your old RAM and new RAM sticks together for maximum performance. That's right; you don't have to buy all new RAM sticks to upgrade your Macbook's performance.

Here's the thing, most Macbooks come with two RAM slots which means that you can upgrade your RAM in pairs. If your Macbook already has one RAM stick installed, all you need to do is purchase another RAM stick and combine it with the one you already have.

For example, let's say your Macbook comes with 4GB RAM installed, and you want to upgrade it to 8GB. You could purchase a 4GB RAM stick and combine it with the one already installed. This would give you 8GB of total RAM and significantly boost your Macbook's performance.

But why combine old and new RAM sticks? Well, it's all about compatibility. If you match the speed and timing of your old and new RAM correctly, you can potentially get better performance because the timing and speed of both the old and new RAM modules will be balanced, ensuring that they work together efficiently.

However, you must ensure that the old and new RAM sticks have the same speed and timing or are as close as possible. If the RAM sticks have different timings, the computer will set the timing to the slowest of the two. This means that you won't get the full performance benefit of the faster RAM stick, and it might even slow down your computer.

To check the speed and timing of your RAM, you can use a free tool like CPU-Z, which will give you detailed information on your computer's RAM.

In conclusion, upgrading your Macbook's RAM doesn't have to break the bank. By combining old and new RAM sticks together, you can get maximum performance on a budget. Just make sure that the speed and timing of your old and new RAM sticks are compatible, and you'll be well on your way to a faster and more efficient Macbook.

## Chosen Solution
 Macbook A1342  started with original 2GB of RAM, I decided to go big and try to get 16 to work (reportedly, the machine can handle it).  Ordered 2 8GB sticks —specs match exactly—.  If I install both 8GB sticks, the machine will not boot up and makes a single beep every 4/5 seconds.  If I put one of the old 1 GB RAM sticks back  in (for a total of 9GB),  the machine works fine (actually, so much better than with the original 2 GB).  I’ve swapped the 8GB and 1GB sticks around in both slots and tried all combinations chips and slots with 8GB and 1GB and it works in all cases( so no bad chips or slots), but refuses to boot up with 2 8GB sticks installed.  I tried resetting SMC and PRAM with no effect.  It seems like others have had this trouble and frequently just give up and run the mismatched RAM.   9GB is much better than 2GB, can I return the second 8 GB stick if there is no way to make the machine use both of them?

 Do you have the 2.26 GHz or 2.4 GHz?
When you have the 9 GB of RAM installed, go under the Apple to “about this Mac” and tell us how much the machine is reporting.
