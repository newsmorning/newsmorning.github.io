Gone are the days when you needed to strain to hear the person on the other end of the line, with the sound being muffled by background noise or low-signal strength. Apple's new feature ensures that the sound quality is crystal clear, completely blocking out any background noise to provide an immersive call experience.

This technology is made possible by Apple's advanced noise-cancellation technology. The iPhone X uses a combination of hardware and software to achieve this. It features an array of microphones that work together to detect and filter out ambient noise, while the software processes the audio to provide clear sound. The result is a phone call experience that is second to none, with no distractions at all.

But that's not all - Apple's iPhone X also comes with a host of other features to enhance your communication experience. It's packed with top-of-the-line hardware, such as the A11 Bionic chip, which provides lightning-fast speed and unparalleled performance. It features a beautiful edge-to-edge OLED display, which provides an immersive experience that you won't find on any other device.

Additionally, the iPhone X's camera capabilities stand head and shoulders above those of any other smartphone. It comes equipped with a dual-lens system that allows you to take stunning portrait shots with ease. The camera also features optical zoom, image stabilization, and a host of other features that will allow you to take your photography game to the next level.

It's evident that Apple's new iPhone X update is nothing short of revolutionary. The technology has been engineered to provide a phone call experience that is unparalleled, featuring crystal-clear sound quality and no distractions. The iPhone X's powerful hardware and software are designed to enhance every aspect of your life, from communication to entertainment and everything in between.

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a new phone, look no further than the iPhone X. It's packed with features that you won't find anywhere else, including the revolutionary noise-cancellation technology that makes it so easy to hear the person you're calling. With the iPhone X, every call will be a joy to take, and you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

## Chosen Solution
 I can’t hear the person I’m calling and I have my volume as high as it will go

 Can you hear them on loud speaker or head phones? If you can it would point to a faulty earpiece flex assembly or the top speaker.

 If you are having difficulties hearing people from your earpiece speaker could be many things. My first thought is that there might be some debris clogging up the speaker grill. Could also be a faulty top speaker flex assembly, as was mentioned already.
For a more thorough list of issues I would recommend having a look at the iPhone No Sound page which has a pretty extensive list of ways to try and isolate this issue.
