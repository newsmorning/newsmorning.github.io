Additionally, the safety design features an overcharge protection that shuts off the charger automatically when the tablet is fully charged, protecting your device from overcharging.

So, how fast is the charging time with this compatible charger? On average, a fully depleted DL 1023 tablet will take about 2 hours to completely charge with the UL Listed Power Adapter. This is significantly faster compared to using other chargers, which may take up to 3 hours or more.
