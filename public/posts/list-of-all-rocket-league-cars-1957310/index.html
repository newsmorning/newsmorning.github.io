The Ultimate List Revealed! Rocket League, the exciting vehicular soccer game, has been a favorite of players for years. With its fast-paced gameplay, beautiful graphics, and stunning cars, it’s no wonder that Rocket League continues to captivate gamers worldwide. However, what really sets Rocket League apart from other games is not just its gameplay, but the amazing ability of cars to do things beyond our imaginations.\nIn this article, we will explore some of the most incredible things Rocket League cars can do. These superpowers are bound to leave you awestruck and make you want to jump into the game straight away!\n1. Fly like a bird\nOne of the most amazing features of Rocket League cars is their ability to leap off the ground and soar through the air. This allows players to perform all sorts of incredible moves, such as mid-air flips, dodges, and aerial shots. From a delicate touch to a high-flying aerial, these cars can do it all.\n2. Teleportation\nImagine being able to teleport in a game like Rocket League? With certain car models such as the ‘Octane ZSR’ and ‘Dominus GT’, one can quickly change their car’s position on the field with a blink of an eye. It’s a feature that truly sets Rocket League apart from other games.\n3. Super speed\nIn Rocket League, some cars go a lot faster than others. For instance, the ‘Octane’ and ‘Dominus’ models are more than capable of zooming across the field at a frightening pace, leaving their opponents in the dust. This ability is incredibly useful, especially when trying to score a goal or retake possession of the ball.\n4. Freeze your opponents\nAnother amazing feature of Rocket League cars is their ability to freeze opponents’ cars, giving players an incredible advantage. Cars like ‘Frostbite’ and ‘Snowstorm’ have the power to freeze opponents mid-flight, causing them to fall down onto the ground in a heap. This feature is incredibly useful when trying to disrupt the opponent’s momentum and gain possession of the ball.\n5. Control the ball with magnets\nIn Rocket League, some cars have magnets that can attract or push the ball around the field with ease. Cars such as ‘Marauder’ and ‘Esper’ have this unique feature, allowing players to have complete control over the ball’s movement.\n6. Explode when you hit the ball\nYes, an explosion may sound dangerous, but in Rocket League, it can be quite useful. Cars such as ‘Roadhog XL’ and ‘Scarab’ explode upon colliding with the ball, sending it flying in a specific direction. The explosion can be detonated or allowed to detonate upon impact.\n7. Have an afterburner\nThe afterburner feature allows cars to go even faster than their usual speed. The flames that come out of the car’s tailpipe indicate the feature is active, and players can zoom across the field like a comet. Cars like ‘Hotshot’ and ‘Takumi RX-T’ have this feature, making them even more formidable on the field.\nConclusion\nRocket League is an incredible game, and the unique abilities of its cars make it an even more thrilling experience. From high-flying aerials to magnets, super speed to freezing opponents, the Rocket League cars can do it all. Next time you play the game, keep these in mind and see for yourself how they can help you defeat your opponents.\nRocket League is a famous game where you play soccer with cars. You can customize your car however you like it and you can buy these cars from the vast variety of Battle cars available. Here’s a list of all Rocket League Cars you can find!\nList of All Cars in Rocket League There are 95 Battle cars in the game and they can be divided into the following categories:\nCommon HogsticketExclusives Very rare Import Exotic Limited Premium Common Cars These category cars are unlocked by completing the matches. You will get Breakout, Octane, and Merc as your first cars in the game and to unlock other common cars, you will need to complete Challenges in the game. Currently, 9 Cars fall into the Common category, they are:\nBackfire Breakout Dominus Gizmo Hotshot Merc Octane Paladin Road Hog Venom X-Devil Exclusive Cars Exclusive category Cars are only accessible to the players who play on a particular platform. There are 5 Exclusive cars in this category and they are available in respective platforms as mentioned in the below list:\nArmadillo – Xbox One Hogsticker – Xbox One Luigi NSR – Nintendo Switch Mario NSR – Nintendo Switch Samus’ Gunship – Nintendo Switch Sweet Tooth – PS4 Very Rare Care Very Rare Category cars are obtained from the Drops. In the older version of Rocket League, these cars were classified as Legacy but after Patch v1.81 these cars were categorized into the Very Rare Category. There are 16 Cars in this Category they are:\nAftershock Esper Grog Marauder Masamune Proteus Ripper Scarab Takumi Triton Vulcan Zippy Import Cars Import Battle cars are obtained either by gathering Blueprints or the game’s Trade-in System, by which players can trade 5 Very Rare items. You can get Blueprints as rewards at the end of each match. Although, you will have to pay to get it. And Currently, 33 cars fall into this category and they are:\nAnimus GP Breakout Type-S Centio Cyclone Diestro Dingo Dominus GT Endo Fennec Imperator DT5 Insido Jackal Jäger 619 Mantis Mamba NASCAR Chevrolet Camaro NASCAR Ford Mustang NASCAR Toyota Camry Nimbus Octane ZSR Peregrine TT Road Hog XL Samurai Sentinel Takumi RX-T Twinzer Tygris Werewolf X-Devil Mk2 Exotic Cars Car Bundles purchased from item shops are believed to be classified as Exotic. But, there’s no clarity about it because when buying Bundles you will get cars that fall under different categories but while purchasing them from the item shop it will be shown as Exotic. For example, Batmobile Halloween Bundle which had Batmobile(2016), Batmobile(1989), and The Dark Knight’s Thumbler was available from October 14, 2021, to November 1, 2021, and was sold for 2000 credits. Although, Batmobile(2016) and Batmobile(1989) fall under Premium Category. Hence, to avoid confusion any cars purchased as Bundles from the item shop are not included in the Exotic Category. Hence, Kamodo is the only Exotic car found currently in the game.\nLimited Cars Limited cars are only obtainable via special events or in certain Rocket Pass. And currently, 15 Limited Battle cars fall in this category and they are obtainable or could be obtained from the following event:\nNemesis – Obtainable by linking your Twitch Prime account Battle Bus – Lama Rama event that happened from September 26, 2020, to October 12, 2020. Maverick – Rocket Pass 1 Artemis – Rocket Pass 2 Guardian – Rocket Pass 3 Mudcat – Rocket Pass 4 Chikara – Rocket Pass 5 Ronin – Rocket Pass 6 Harbinger – Season 1 Rocket Pass R3MX – Season 2 Rocket Pass Tyranno – Season 3 Rocket Pass Outlaw – Season 4 Rocket Pass Nexus – Season 5 Rocket Pass Nomad – Season 6 Rocket Pass Maestro – Season 7 Rocket Pass Premium Cars These cars were obtainable through DLC Packs. However, after Patch v1.70, DLC Packs became unavailable in the game. Hence, you cannot obtain premium Battle cars by this method. Although you can still get them by buying their Bundles in the Item Shop and there are 16 Premium Cars found in the game, they are:\nBatmobile (2016) ’70 Dodge Charger R/T Batmobile (1989) ’99 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 Bone Shaker DeLorean Time Machine Ecto-1 Fast 4WD Gazella GT Ice Charger Jurassic Jeep Wrangler K.I.T.T.
