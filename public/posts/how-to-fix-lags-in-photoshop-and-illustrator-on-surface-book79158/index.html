However, if you are using a Surface Book, you may experience annoying lag during your creative process, which can be incredibly frustrating and hinder your productivity. In this article, we will explore the secret to eliminating annoying lag in Photoshop and Illustrator on your Surface Book, so you can boost your productivity and achieve your goals.\nThe Problem Before we dive into the solution, let’s take a closer look at the problem. The Surface Book is a fantastic device that provides excellent performance, making it an ideal choice for graphic designers. However, you may experience lag while working in Photoshop and Illustrator, particularly when handling complex designs or using too many layers. This lag can be frustrating and time-consuming, leading to a lack of productivity and delay in the workflow.\nThe Solution So, what is the secret to eliminating annoying lag in Photoshop and Illustrator on your Surface Book? The answer lies in your device’s graphics settings. By tweaking these settings to suit your workflow, you can significantly improve the performance of your software, thereby reducing lag and enhancing your productivity.\nHere are some tips to optimize your graphics settings:\n1. Update your graphics driver First things first, ensure that your graphics driver is up to date. Check the manufacturer’s website for any updates that may be available and install them. An outdated driver may cause compatibility issues with your software, leading to lag.\n2. Adjust your hardware acceleration settings Hardware acceleration is a feature that enables your device’s graphics card to perform complex tasks faster, reducing lag. To adjust your hardware acceleration settings, go to Preferences \u003e Performance in Photoshop and uncheck the “Use Graphics Processor” option. In Illustrator, go to Edit \u003e Preferences \u003e Performance and adjust the slider under GPU Performance.\n3. Disable unnecessary features Photoshop and Illustrator may have some features that you do not use, but may still consume system resources, leading to lag. Disable these features to free up your device’s resources. Examples of such features include 3D functionalities, plugins, and extensions.\n4. Optimize your document settings When creating a new document in Photoshop or Illustrator, make sure that the document settings are optimized for your device’s performance. Use the RGB color mode instead of CMYK, reduce the number of layers or artboards, and use smaller file sizes.\nConclusion Lag in Photoshop and Illustrator on your Surface Book can be frustrating and time-consuming, but by optimizing your device’s graphics settings, you can eliminate this issue and boost your productivity. Update your graphics driver, adjust your hardware acceleration settings, disable unnecessary features, and optimize your document settings to improve your device’s overall performance. With these tips, you can experience a smooth and seamless creative process, enabling you to achieve your goals and produce stunning designs.\nJust like Surface Pro 4, Microsoft’s Surface Book is also very suitable for artists, especially graphic designers.\nWhen using Surface Book for Photoshop, lags can appear due to an outdated software version.\nIf on Surface Book 2 you encounter Photoshop lags, check the Nvidia settings.\nAdobe Illustrator is lagging when the tool is outdated, so make sure to use the latest version.\nSurface Book 2 is a great device for Illustrator. If it runs slow, you have to check the GPU settings.\nDownload Restoro PC Repair Tool that comes with Patented Technologies (patent available here).\nClick Start Scan to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems.\nClick Repair All to fix issues affecting your computer’s security and performance\nRestoro has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.\nAnd of course, some of the most popular tools that all serious artists and designers use are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.\nBut users are complaining about various lags in these programs, which makes it almost impossible to use them:\nThe complaints started to appear in early October of 2015, and Microsoft still didn’t announce any possible fix for lags in Adobe’s software.\nMS is pitching the Surface Book as the Ultimate laptop and for Creative people. I found that there is considerable lag in Illustrator and just a bit better in Photoshop while drawing and zooming in and out. The lag is so bad in Illustrator that its not even worth running.\nThe company is actually aware of the problem, as a few Microsoft employees contacted users on forums, but they didn’t provide any useful info.\nThey didn’t even announce the actual fixing update, which means that the company doesn’t pay a lot of attention to this problem.\nThey actually only advised users to apply the latest updates, but you can judge yourself how much is that helpful.\nHow do I fix lags in Photoshop or Illustrator on Surface Book? 1. Get the latest Adobe Photoshop/Adobe Illustrator CC version Editing and prepping up photos for your professional projects can’t go wrong when using Adobe Photoshop.\nThe same goes for those times when you are eager to create unique graphics for a variety of purposes like brochures, book covers, and flyers.\nAs for those of you using Adobe Illustrator, you are also accustomed to getting the very best from this industry-standard vector graphics software tool.\nTherefore, you should better make sure that the lagging issue isn’t actually the result of having an old version of Adobe Photoshop/Adobe Illustrator CC version.\nTo rule out this option, simply visit the official Adobe homepage, grab the most recent version of the program and install it.\n⇒ Download Adobe Photoshop\n⇒ Download Adobe Illustrator CC\n2. Try installing the NVidia Control Panels Download and install GeForce Experience. When installed, right-click on your desktop, and go to NVIDIA Control Panel. Go to Manage 3D Settings. Go to the Program Settings tab, and select Adobe Photoshop (Photoshop.exe) from the dropdown list. Now, head to the Specify Settings list, and find the Power Management Mode settings. Change it from Adaptive to Maximum Performance. Restart your computer. One user has managed to find a working solution too. It requires installing the NVidia Control Panels and changing a few settings., as described above.\nThis Insider from Microsoft forums even explained to us what was causing the lagging problems. Namely, Adaptive Performance saves power, but it doesn’t work well with Adobe’s products.\nUnlike 3D games or video editing, which exploits the GPU to the fullest, working in Adobe Photoshop only accelerates certain tasks.\nAs a consequence, there’s a delay in the time you do a certain action (start drawing, for example) and the time system directs more power to the GPU.\nBut, when you set the GPU to Prefer Maximum Performance, the GPU will always have the necessary power. Using this, there will be no delay, therefore the lagging problem will be eliminated.\nThis was a serious issue, and Microsoft or Adobe should at least give some advice to users on how to deal with it, even though it doesn’t require any update or actions from the companies.\nLuckily, users managed to find the solution by themselves, but that won’t be the case every time, with every problem, and the experience of using Surface Book could be significantly damaged.\nUPDATE: according to some users, the issue was later solved by an NVidia update. Still, users say that the lagging problems continue. For that, you can use the solutions mentioned above.\nEven recently, the lagging issue persists. Generally, it has to do with Surface Book not using the maximum performance necessary for running Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.\nPlease leave us a comment if the above solutions helped you with the error, or if you have any other suggestions.\nAdobe IllustratorAdobe Photoshopsurface book Email *\nCommenting as .
