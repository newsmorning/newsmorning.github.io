Have you recently replaced the charging port on your iPhone 6 and noticed a drop in your cell service? If so, you're not alone, and you may be wondering if the repair caused the issue. In this article, we'll discuss whether a charger port replacement can impact your cell service, and what you can do about it.

First, let's understand what the charger port does. The charging port is responsible for charging your phone's battery and connecting it to your computer. However, it's not directly related to your cell service. Your cell service depends on your phone's antenna and the cellular network around you.

So, if replacing the charger port is not directly related to the cell service, then why do some people notice a drop in signal after the repair? The answer lies in the complexity of the iPhone's hardware. The iPhone's internal components are tightly packed together, with the antenna located near the charging port. While replacing the charger port, there's a chance that the antenna gets moved or disrupted, causing a drop in signal strength.

Another possibility is that the repair was not done correctly, and the technician may have damaged the antenna or the connections. To check if the repair has affected your cell service, you can try to reset your network settings. This will erase all saved Wi-Fi networks and cellular settings, forcing your iPhone to search for the network from scratch. To reset your network settings, go to:

Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings

If resetting your network settings doesn't work, you can try resetting your iPhone's settings. This will erase all your settings and preferences, but your data will remain intact. To reset your settings, go to:

Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings

If the above methods don't work, you can try contacting your service provider for assistance. They can run a diagnostic test and check for any network issues or coverage problems in your area.

In conclusion, changing your iPhone 6's charger port doesn't directly affect your cell service. However, the repair process is complicated, and there's a chance of causing damage to the antenna or connections. If you're experiencing a drop in signal strength after the repair, you can try resetting your network settings or contacting your service provider for help.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently changed the lightning assembly on my iPhone 6 with one I bought online.  It seems to be made by jbl.
I carefully installed it and am confident all connections are tight and correct.
Where I used to get 4 bars verizon lte, I am now lucky to get 2 bars 3G and more typically  1x.
The only thing I can think of is that the replcement did not have the little foam bumper on the antenna connector by the battery connector.  I could not get it off the original without damaging it beyond use.
I tried insulating it with a bit of electrical tape, but that was unsuccessful in improving signal strength. Now I'm wondering if the foam is conductive and was making a connection to the battery connector cover.
If that's the case, does anyone have a suggestion about how to replace the foam piece? Preferably a locally source able product.
Or, if I'm way off on my thoughts, I'll take suggestions. I've combed the forums and tried cleaning terminals, making sure all connections are firm, etc.
Thank in advance.

 It seems like you got an lightning-assembly that is disfunctional, or have problems. As far as i know there are antenna on the buttom(On lightning-assembly) and on the top of the phone. Getting spare-parts for iPhone is harder than you think, because the quality between the spare-parts producers are very different. I would recommend you to order an new lightning-assembly from another seller and try again.
You could also try to reassemble to your old lightning-assembly and see if it makes a differnce.

 I also have this problem after I changed the Lightning assembly as described on iFixit. The phone now charges great, but the Settings > Battery shows that "No Cell Coverage" is hogging 30-40% of the battery. The phone will run through its entire charge from 100% to auto power off in about 8 hours, just sitting on a table not being used.
Often "No Service" appears in the top left of the display, or "Verizon" either with either 0, 1, 2 dots or no dot display at all in the meter. It also occasionally displays "Extended". My wife has the same model phone, and none of this happens to her and her battery lasts 24 to 36 hours on a charge. The phones are the same age to the day.
I've tried "Reset Network Settings", hard boot by holding the Power and Home buttons, removing and reinserting the SIM card with the phone both powered down and hot. All done several times, but the battery still drains like crazy.
I suspect there is something wrong with the antenna connection somewhere. When I replaced the Lightning connector assembly, I didn't remove the screen like in steps 13 to 19. Instead I just had the screen open 90 degrees with the connectors still attached. Other than the battery drain issue, the phone functions fine.
