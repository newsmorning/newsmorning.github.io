# Revolutionize Your Outlook Experience: Discover the 5 Effortless Tips to Supercharge Indexing on Windows 11!

Microsoft's Windows 11 is the latest operating system that has taken the world by storm with its advanced features and stunning  user interface. Windows 11 comes packed with several innovative features that elevate the user experience, including indexing, which enables users to quickly find the files they need.

In this article, we'll show you five effortless tips to supercharge indexing on Windows 11, which will help you revolutionize your Outlook experience.

## 1) Optimize the Indexing Settings

The first major tip to supercharge your indexing experience is to optimize your indexing settings. Click on the Start menu, choose Settings, and proceed to System>Storage.  Locate the ‘Advanced storage’ option, and then click on the ‘Optimize Drives’ button.

Windows will identify the system drive and establish its SSD or HDD status. Once done, proceed to the option that reads “Change how Windows searches,” and optimize your drives as you please. This will help boost your PC's speed, allowing Outlook to access your hard drive's file directory faster.

## 2) Get Rid of Duplicate Files

Another useful trick is to remove duplicate files from your PC. You can use third-party software such as CCleaner to remove duplicate files that may slow down your system. Duplicate files refer to multiple copies of the same file located on your hard drive, and they take up precious memory that could be put to better use.

When you get rid of duplicate files, your search results in Outlook will become more streamlined and precise.

## 3) Manage the Outlook Indexing Settings

The third tip is to manage the indexing settings in Outlook itself. Open Outlook and select File>Options>Search. You will see a checkbox that will allow Outlook to index items. Ensure it is selected, and from there, you can select specific directories to index or remove any directories that you do not need to index.

## 4) Use Shortcut Keys

The fourth tip to enhance your indexing experience is by using shortcut keys. Instead of clicking with your mouse, you can use shortcuts such as Ctrl+E to initiate a search. This will bring up the search bar, and you can enter your keywords from there.

You can also use F3 to find the next instance of a search term, making it faster to sift through lengthy results.

## 5) Clear the Outlook Cache

Finally, the last tip is to clear your Outlook cache. The cache is a collection of temporary files stored on your system to quicken the loading process. However, over time, they can accumulate, leading to slow performance.

To clear the cache, close Outlook and navigate to C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook. Locate the cache file (outlook.ost) and delete it. Restart Outlook, and a fresh cache will be created.

That completes our list of five effortless tips to supercharge indexing on Windows 11. With these tips, you can revolutionize your Outlook experience by turning comprehensive folders full of files into easy-to-find items. Good luck and enjoy your faster and smoother experience.
