Title: Dell's Latest Launch is Set to Take Down Microsoft's Surface Studio

Introduction
On May 25, 2021, Dell launched its highly anticipated all-in-one PC that has been specifically designed to take on Microsoft's Surface Studio. This revolutionary machine, known as the Dell Precision 5750, is capable of handling complex workloads and high-end graphics, giving the Surface Studio a run for its money.

Body
The Dell Precision 5750 boasts a 17-inch 4K OLED display that provides an incredibly immersive user experience. The screen is highly color-accurate, with 100% Adobe RGB and 100% DCI-P3, making it ideal for graphic designers, photographers, and video editors. This stunning display is supported by top-of-the-line graphics, with the NVIDIA Quadro RTX 3000 graphics card, which is perfect for rendering 3D models and even gaming.

Under the hood, the Dell Precision 5750 features the new 11th Gen Intel Core i9 processor, with up to 64GB of DDR4 memory and up to 4TB of PCIe NVMe SSD storage. This powerhouse of a PC can handle intensive tasks such as video rendering, editing large images, and running simulations with ease. Additionally, it comes with a range of ports, including Thunderbolt™ 4, USB-C, HDMI 2.0, and an SD card reader, making it highly versatile and convenient.

Design-wise, the Dell Precision 5750 is sleek and slim, with an ultra-thin bezel that maximizes the screen real estate. It also has a unique feature that allows the display to tilt back to a 20-degree angle, which is ideal for sketching and drawing with a stylus. Its seamless design and exceptional build quality make it both stylish and durable.

Conclusion
In conclusion, Dell's Precision 5750 is a game-changer in the all-in-one PC market. Its impressive display, powerful internals, and sleek design make it an appealing option for professionals who need a reliable and versatile machine. With this launch, Dell has shown a willingness to compete directly with Microsoft's Surface Studio, and it will be interesting to see how these two machines stack up against each other in the months to come.

Dell has taken a huge chunk of inspiration from its rival Microsoft and is all set to release what looks like a remake of Microsoft’s Surface Studio desktop PC along with all its accessories, including their very own version of the Surface Dial and a touch interface.
 
The revelation was uncovered at the Adobe Max conference in San Diego during a promotional video from Dell revealing their own take on the Surface Studio PC. Dell would like you to know this isn’t a copy, and that they’ve been working on the idea for over three years now. What they call the Smart Desk (working title) will be formally announced during the Consumer Electronics Show in January. The teaser, however, didn’t reveal any specs or pricing of the device but from what we can make out, it’s similar to a PC with two screens (including a touch display) and additional input stylus, like its very own Surface Dial-like hardware to draw on the enormous display. Adobe is most likely an active partner and the collaboration on workflows and layouts seem to be going well in the favor of Dell.
 
The Smart Desk design does look more complex than the Surface Studio, as the Surface Studio is a desktop-tablet hybrid with a clever and artistic dial interface best for sitting at a comfortable angle for long periods of touch interaction. Meanwhile, the Smart Desk is a blend of a Surface Studio-like tablet with a conventional computer monitor. While Microsoft’s creation is a desktop PC that converts to a high-definition touch and pen input slate, Dell has the two separated, projecting the interactive parts of an application on the tablet portion of the device with results are displayed on a regular monitor.
 
“Our thoughts naturally transfer to paper. But there’s a gap between what comes naturally and how we create digitally,” the video explains. “Dell has changed that.”
 
Another thing to notice is the absence of a keyboard and mouse , so the stylus is the only option left for input. It is still unknown how designers will react to the lack of keyboard input that comes handy in most situations.
 

 
As far as we can speculate, Microsoft will only be flattered by the supposed inspiration Dell has derived from their Surface Studio. Moreover, Windows chief Terry Myerson was, in fact, favoring the idea of allowing partners to utilize their technologies to incorporate them in their own hardware which could result in an overall improved version of the original.
 
Dell in a press release has described their Smart Desk as a “workplace of the future concept”, but has refrained from mentioning any pricing details whatsoever. From what we gather, they are waiting to see the consumer response for the Surface Studio to consider releasing their creation at a competitive rate.
