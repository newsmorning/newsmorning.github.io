Title: Devastating! How My Desktop PC Was Destroyed by My Own Computer - You Won't Believe What Happened!

Introduction:
My desktop computer was my best friend for years. It was my tool for work and leisure, and I poured a lot of time and resources into maintaining and upgrading it. But one fateful day, my trusty companion turned into my worst enemy. In this article, I'll recount the tale of how my desktop PC was destroyed by my own computer, and it's an experience that you won't believe.

Body:
It all started like any other day. I turned on my computer, and the startup process went off without a hitch. But as soon as the desktop loaded, I noticed something was off. The desktop icons were all over the place, and the wallpaper was distorted. I tried to adjust the resolution and refresh rate, but nothing worked. Then, out of nowhere, the computer shut down.

I tried to restart it, but it wouldn't budge. I opened up the case and ran some diagnostics, and that's when I saw the horror. The components inside the computer were melted and charred. The power supply unit had exploded, and the motherboard was fried. The hard drive was damaged beyond repair, and the graphics card was toast.

I was in shock. How could this happen? I had never overclocked or pushed my computer to its limits. It had always worked flawlessly, and I had taken good care of it. But as I dug deeper, I realized the root cause of the disaster.

It turns out that my computer had been infected by malware that had gone undetected for months. This malicious software had been silently running in the background, slowly corrupting my files and destabilizing the system. And when the power supply unit failed, it unleashed a power surge that destroyed everything in its path.

Conclusion:
The aftermath of this ordeal was devastating. I lost all my data and had to start from scratch. I also had to invest in a new computer, which was a significant financial hit. But more than that, I lost my trust in technology. I realized that no matter how advanced and reliable our devices may seem, they're still vulnerable to attacks and failures.

So, what can we do to prevent such disasters? First and foremost, we need to be vigilant and proactive when it comes to cybersecurity. We should always keep our software up to date, use reliable anti-virus programs, and avoid downloading suspicious files. We should also regularly back up our data to a secure location, so we don't lose everything in case of a catastrophic event like this.

In conclusion, my experience taught me a lesson that I'll never forget. Our computers may be powerful tools that make our lives easier, but they're not invincible. We must treat them with care and respect if we want to avoid the devastating consequences of neglect and ignorance.

## Chosen Solution
 While working on my power supply, I grounded the power to the chaise. Is the computer ruined )Toast?

 Which power line? See if it still boots up and if it doesn't test your PSU. Short the green wire to ground. Yellow should be 12v, red should be 5, orange should be 3.3, white is either -5 or -12.
