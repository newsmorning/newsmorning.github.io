You Won't Believe What Fell Out of Your KitchenAid KSM150PSER - Quick Fix Revealed!

Kitchen appliances are essential tools in the kitchen, especially when you're cooking or baking your favorite dish. But what happens when something goes wrong? If you own a KitchenAid KSM150PSER, a falling object might be the last thing you expect. In this article, we'll reveal a quick fix that will help you get back to cooking and baking in no time.

The KitchenAid KSM150PSER is a classic mixer that has been around for quite some time. It's a popular choice among home cooks and professional bakers, thanks to its durability, ease of use, and versatility. However, like any other appliance, it can encounter some problems. One of the most common issues reported by KitchenAid KSM150PSER owners is the presence of foreign objects that get stuck in the mixer.

It may sound strange, but over time, small objects such as screws, bolts, and other kitchen utensils can find their way inside your KitchenAid KSM150PSER. If you hear a strange noise, notice a strange vibration or the mixer suddenly stops working, it's possible that something has fallen inside. But don't worry - this is a fixable problem.

The first step is to unplug your mixer and remove the bowl and attachments. Turn the mixer upside down over a large bowl or container, and gently shake it. If there's an object inside, it should fall out. However, if nothing comes out, you'll need to disassemble the mixer to check for the object's location.

To do this, you'll need a screwdriver, a clean cloth, and a work area with good lighting. Begin by removing the mixer's head by unscrewing the two screws on the back. Then, remove the motor housing by unscrewing the three screws at the bottom. Gently lift the housing off, and you'll see the motor.

Carefully inspect the motor for any foreign objects. If you find something, use a pair of pliers or tweezers to remove it. Once you've removed the object, wipe the motor, housing, and attachments with a clean cloth. Reassemble the mixer, plug it in, and test it to see if it's working correctly.

If you can't find the object or are unsure how to proceed with the disassembly, contact the KitchenAid customer service hotline. They'll be able to walk you through the process or refer you to an authorized service provider.

In conclusion, foreign objects getting stuck in your KitchenAid KSM150PSER is a common problem. It can be scary, but don't panic. By following these simple steps, you can quickly fix the problem at home. Always put safety first and never attempt to fix the mixer without first unplugging it. Happy cooking and baking!

## Chosen Solution
 My speed control panel needed adjusting as my stand mixer would only go high speed no matter what setting. When I opened up the back to try adjusting the screws first to fix the speed problem a little piece fell out that is a U-shaped with a rolling metal cylinder on the bottom. It just fell out and I have no idea where it goes or if it’s essential to put back in but I’m guessing so. My model number is KSM155GBSN it is a KitchenAid artisan 5 quart.

 looks likes a capacitor not sure been a while but i would say it would probably mount back in there google the the electrical schematic on that model and find the location looks like you could fit it back in but im sure there is professionals here
