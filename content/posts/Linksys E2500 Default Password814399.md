For all versions of the Linksys E2500 N600 router, the default password is admin. As with most passwords, this one is case-sensitive.

 

Although some Linksys routers require a default username, the E2500 does not, so you can just leave that blank.

 

Like similar routers, 192.168.1.1 is the default IP address used to access the web interface.

 
##   When the E2500 Default Password Doesn't Work  
 

The default password and username for this router are always the same when the router is first installed, but you can (and should) change both to something unique and considerably more secure.

 
There are four hardware versions for the Linksys E2500, but they all follow the same details described above.
 

The only downfall to that, of course, is that these new, more complicated, words and numbers are easier to forget than a blank username and admin. If you don't know the login details you assigned to the router, you have to reset it to its factory settings.

 

Resetting the E2500 is the only way to restore the default username and password. Here's how:

 
- Make sure the router is plugged in and powered on.
 - Physically turn the router over so you have full access to the bottom side.
 - Using a small, sharp object such as a straightened paperclip, press and hold the Reset button for 10 seconds. Continue to press this button until the Ethernet port lights on the back flash at the same time.
 - Unplug the power cable for 10 to 15 seconds and then plug it back in.
 - Wait 30 seconds before continuing so that it has had plenty of time to boot back up.
 - Confirm that the network cable is still attached to the computer and router.

 

Now that the settings have been restored, you can access the Linksys E2500 at http://192.168.1.1 with admin for the password.

Confirm that the network cable is still attached to the computer and router.

 

Be sure to change the router's password to something secure, as well as the username, if you want a bit of an extra layer of security.

 

Now, you have to reconfigure your wireless network settings because resetting the E2500 removed all your custom ones. This includes your network name, network password, and any other custom settings you may have configured, like port forwarding rules or custom DNS servers.

 
##   When You Can't Access Your E2500 Router  
 

Most routers are accessed as a URL through their IP address, which, in the case of the E2500, is http://192.168.1.1 by default. However, if you've ever changed this address to something else, you need to know what that address is before you can log in.

 

Finding the E2500 IP address is easy and doesn't require a process as involved as resetting the whole router. You can do this if at least one computer that's connected to the router is working normally. If so, you need to know the default gateway that the computer is using.
