Neglecting this task can cause serious damages to the engine and the transmission, which can lead to expensive repairs in the long run.\nYou’ll need the following tools:\nA socket set A flat head screwdriver A clean drain pan Clean rags A new oil filter A new oil drain plug washer A funnel A torque wrench Here’s how to change your oil and filter step by step.\n1- Preparation\nStart by ensuring that your motorcycle is on a level surface, and the engine is not hot. Your motorcycle should also be in a stand, so it’s easier for you to work around.\n2- Draining the oil\nPlace your clean drain pan underneath the oil drain bolt. Using a socket set, remove the oil drain bolt and let the oil drain out. Once it’s drained entirely, you should clean the drain bolt and install a new oil drain plug washer. You can also reuse the old one if it’s still in good condition. Tighten the oil drain bolt to 14 foot-pounds using a torque wrench.\n3- Removing the oil filter\nLocate the oil filter cover and remove the two bolts using a socket set. Remove the old oil filter element and dispose of it. Clean the area around the filter cavity and inspect the cover gasket. Replace the gasket if it’s in poor condition or damaged.\n4- Installing the new oil filter\nApply a little bit of oil on the new oil filter element, and place it in the filter cavity. Ensure that the cover gasket is still in place and fit the cover over the filter. Tighten the two bolts to 7.2 foot-pounds using a torque wrench.\n5- Refilling the engine with oil\nFirst, insert the funnel into the oil filler hole. Pour in 850 ml (28 US oz) of Yamaha 10W-40 engine oil. Remove the funnel and reinstall the oil filler cap.\n6- Checking the oil level\nStart your engine and let it run for a few minutes. Then, turn it off and wait for a few minutes to allow the oil to settle. Remove the oil filler cap, clean it, and reinsert it into the filler hole without screwing it. Remove it again and check the oil level using the dipstick.\n7- Cleaning up\nDispose of the old oil and filter properly. Clean the drain pan and refill your cleaning supplies.\nAnd that’s it! You’ve successfully changed your oil and filter. Make sure to check your oil levels regularly and change it according to your motorcycle’s manufacturer’s recommendations. By performing this task regularly, you’re maintaining the longevity of the engine and the transmission, ensuring a smooth riding experience.\nDifficulty\nModerate\nSteps\n10\nTime Required\n25 - 40 minutes Sections\n1\n2015 Yamaha YZ250F Oil and Filter Change 10 steps Flags\nFeatured Student Guide This guide has been the hard work of our awesome students and is found to be exceptionally cool by the iFixit staff.\nBackYamaha Motorcycle\nFull Screen\nOptions\nHistory\nSave to Favorites\nDownload PDF\nEdit\nTranslate\nGet Shareable Link\nEmbed This Guide\nNotify Me of Changes\nStop Notifications\nIntroduction Additionally, as you will be working with oil, it is vital that the oil be disposed of properly.
