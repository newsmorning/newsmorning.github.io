## Chosen Solution
 So when I Press the on button,  the laptop will turn on and display the Acer loading screen  it will then go black and turn off  and continue like that turning on and off again?   I don't know how to fix it. It is a fairly new model so there is not possible way of removing the battery without taking the laptop to pieces

 you can press F2 on boot to enter bios, the go to the last menu an select defaults, hope this helps.
