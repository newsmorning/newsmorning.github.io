## Chosen Solution
 When I placed on the new adhesive strips, I accidentally installed them such that the tips of the strips are on the front side of the battery and some of the adhesive is on that front side. Is that going to cause problems? Do I need to remove and place new strips on?

 Most likely! You don't want the battery glued to the back of the LCD. It will cause issues over time. You should be able to roll any excess adhesive off with your fingers so that you dont risk damaging the battery with any tools.
