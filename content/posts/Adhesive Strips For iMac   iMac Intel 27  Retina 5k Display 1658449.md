## Chosen Solution
 Hey,
I ordered everything I needed to take off my iMac display and I’m very experienced in working on electronics, but I’m very concerned with the adhesive strips.
I see a lot of videos and forums and reviews online about the screen falling off days or months later after repair. I really don’t want this to happen.
On your YouTube videos there is no instruction to properly cleaning the iMac with rubbing alcohol but the physical instructions on paper say to clean with rubbing alcohol.
They aren’t very descriptive and don’t say how long you should wait to dry. And stuff like that. I feel concerned that if I use these strips I purchased and received in the mail, they will not stick as good as factory seal, and my iMac screen will fall off.
Any suggestions?

 You face a few different issues here, how well you prepare the surfaces, the quality of the adhesive strips and how you cure the adhesive so it’s making a good bond. And failure of any one of these effects the display mounting.
So to start with making sure the old adhesive is fully cleaned off. I use Goof Off to help remove any traces. Once I’m sure the surfaces are clean I go over the surfaces (metal and glass with a reagent quality isopropyl alcohol 85% or better. The cheap stuff you get is often loaded with junk which leaves a film that prevents the adhesive from making  good adhesion. Heat is also important! Make sure the room you are working in is not cold! and you’ll likely need a heat gun (variable temp) to help warm the surfaces so the cure is effective. Weight (pressure) is also important! Apple uses a rubber roller to help press the display onto the case. Using weights will also work place the screen down on a firm surface with some padding to protect its surface. Place as much weight as you can equally around the case to help press the two surfaces together for a good six hours.
