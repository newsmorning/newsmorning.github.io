Are you tired of getting distracted by your Discord notifications while you work? Do you want to boost your productivity and focus on your tasks? Look no further! We’ve compiled a list of five settings tweaks that will help you unlock the hidden potential of Discord, and take your productivity to the next level.\n1. Disable Notifications The first and most important tweak is to disable notifications. Discord notifications can be a major distraction, especially if you are in the middle of an important task. To disable notifications, simply click on the gear icon next to your username, select the “Notifications” tab, and turn off all “Desktop Notifications.” This will prevent Discord from sending you any pop-up notifications while you work, so you can stay focused.\n2. Mute Channels If you are part of multiple Discord channels, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the constant chatter. To avoid distractions, mute the channels that you don’t need to be active in. Simply right-click on the channel, and select “Mute Channel.” This will prevent the channel from showing up in your notifications, so you can focus on the channels that matter the most.\n3. Set a Status Setting a status can be a great way to communicate with your teammates or clients about your availability. It also helps you avoid any unnecessary interruptions. To set a status, click on your profile icon and select “Set a Status” from the drop-down menu. Choose one of the suggested options or create your own custom status. This will let others know when you are available, busy, or away without the need for constant notifications.\n4. Customize Your Notifications Customizing your notifications is a great way to prevent distractions and stay focused on your work. You can choose which notifications to receive, and when to receive them. To customize your notifications, go to “User Settings,” then “Notifications,” and select “Customize Notifications.” From there, you can choose which notifications to receive, and when to receive them.\n5. Use Keyboard Shortcuts Using keyboard shortcuts is a great way to save time and streamline your workflow. Discord has many keyboard shortcuts that can help you navigate the app without using your mouse. For example, you can press “Ctrl + /” to see all available shortcuts, or “Ctrl + Shift + P” to open the quick switcher. To see a full list of shortcuts, go to “User Settings,” then “Keybinds.”\nIn conclusion, these five settings tweaks will help you unlock the hidden potential of Discord and take your productivity to the next level. By disabling notifications, muting channels, setting a status, customizing your notifications, and using keyboard shortcuts, you can stay focused on your work and minimize distractions. Give these tweaks a try, and see how they can transform your Discord experience. Happy working!\nIf your veins are gushing with gaming DNA, then we’re sure you’re already aware of the term “Discord”.
