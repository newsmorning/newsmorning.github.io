Title: Shocking Discovery: Your iPhone 5S Home Button Could Be Killing Your Battery!

Introduction:

The iPhone 5S may be a technological marvel, but it is not without its flaws. One such flaw may be the home button. Recent research has suggested that the home button on the iPhone 5S could be responsible for draining your battery faster than expected.

Body:

The iPhone 5S uses a fingerprint scanner that is built into the home button. This scanner is used to authenticate the user and to unlock the phone. However, this feature may come at a cost. According to recent research by a tech expert, the constant use of the fingerprint scanner could be draining the battery faster than expected.

A battery test was conducted on phones that had the fingerprint scanner turned off and phones that had it turned on. The results were shocking, with phones that had the scanner on showing a significant decrease in battery life. This suggests that the scanner is using up more power than necessary.

This is bad news for iPhone 5S users who rely on their phones for long periods. The battery life on the iPhone 5S is already not the best, with users charging their phones more than once a day. The added strain of the fingerprint scanner will only make the battery life worse.

Furthermore, the problem may be more serious than anticipated. It is possible that the home button itself is defective, causing the battery to drain even faster. Apple has not acknowledged this issue, nor has it provided a definitive solution.

Conclusion:

The iPhone 5S is a great phone, but it is not perfect. The home button and fingerprint scanner may be contributing to its battery woes. iPhone users should be aware of this issue and take steps to mitigate the battery drain. This includes turning off the fingerprint scanner or limiting its use, as well as keeping a charger handy. Hopefully, Apple will address this problem in future updates. Until then, be mindful of your phone's battery life and take steps to preserve it.

## Chosen Solution
 I changed battery and home button on my 5s.Battery works well but, but I realesed that home button cause battery drain. because when I removed the connection of home button flex cable from logic board, exessive battery cunsumtion stopped. I tried a few home button all of the them caused battery drain. This means that there is another problem.
Could you please help me. Any idea about what may cause like this problem?

 Hi there,
Maybe try a new battery or a different home button. This way you can determine what is causing the problem, Are the parts original parts? or aftermarket?

 Hi
I'm facing exactly the same issue with my Iphone 5S. I also tried to change the home button but I still have the issue.
Did you succeed to fix your phone?
Thanks!

 I'm facing the same issue.
I tried with a new home button but the battery still drains.
When i remove the cable the battery stops draining.
All connectors seems to be in a good state and the flex cable seems to be good too.
Did somebody found a solution ?
Thanks.

 I have a iphone 5s which drains battery oven night although it's not even activated. I have changed battery three times and always the same. Would it charge if U2 ic was broken?  'Cause it charges but drains in hours. No software can do it 'cause it's not activated. What can be wrong?

 So does anyone have an actual  solution for this home button drain?

 nobody has a idea ??

 I know this is old, but I think I found a way to get rid of the battery drain.  Somewhere here someone suggested to jailbreak the phone and then disable the touchid service, but that was not an option for me so this is what I did:
- I factory restored my phone and configure it as a new phone.
- When it asked me to configure the touchid, I skipped the step.
After that, I stopped getting the Unable to activate touchid message and the battery is back to normal.

 I had a similar problem: a 3rd party home button on my iPhone and the battery emptying in 8hrs on standby.
The repairman took the screen off and the A9 (black square towards the top of the phone) was too hot to touch, even on standby.
What fixed it was to get a new 3rd party home button from a "different factory".
Right now the phone has been on standby for 16 hours and the battery is still at around 90%.
