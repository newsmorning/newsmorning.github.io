# Is Your Macbook Pro DYING?! Charger Won't Charge and No Battery Icon - Here's What You NEED to Know

## Introduction

If you own a MacBook Pro, you know the joy of a fully charged battery that can last for hours. But what happens when your charger won't charge and there's no battery icon on your screen? This can be a frustrating and confusing situation, but don't panic! There are a few things you can do to diagnose and fix the problem.

## No Battery Icon

If your MacBook is not showing the battery icon, the first thing you'll want to check is whether the charger is unplugged. If it's still plugged in and there's still no sign of charging, try resetting the SMC (System Management Controller). The SMC controls several functions in your MacBook, including the charging system.

To reset the SMC, you'll need to turn off your MacBook and unplug the charger. Then, hold down the Shift + Control + Option keys on the left side of the keyboard and press the power button at the same time. Release all keys and the power button, then reconnect the charger and turn on your MacBook. If this works, you should see the battery icon appear on the screen.

## Charger Won't Charge

If your MacBook charger won't charge, there are a few things you can try. First, make sure the charger is plugged in securely to your MacBook and the wall outlet. Also, check to see if the charger is damaged or frayed – this can prevent it from charging your MacBook properly.

If you're using an older MacBook with a removable battery, try taking the battery out and then putting it back in. This can sometimes reset the charging system and allow your MacBook to charge.

Another option is to try a different charger if you have one available. Sometimes the issue is with the charger itself, and using a different one can solve the problem.

## Final Thoughts

If you're still having issues with your MacBook charging, it might be time to visit an authorized Apple repair center. They can diagnose and fix the problem, whether it's a hardware or software issue.

In the meantime, keep your MacBook charged by using a backup battery or power bank. You don't want to be caught without power when you need it most.

Remember, it's important to take care of your MacBook to ensure it lasts as long as possible. Regular maintenance and cleaning can help prevent issues like charging problems, so be sure to keep it in good condition.
