You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried Charging My Nintendo DS Lite for Just a Few Minutes!

As an avid gamer, I always ensure that my gaming devices are fully charged to avoid unexpected shutdowns during gameplay. One day, I decided to play my Nintendo DS Lite, but I realized that the battery was almost drained.

With no available charger nearby, I decided to try charging it for just a few minutes using an old cell phone charger that I found lying around. I plugged it into the DS Lite and waited for a few minutes.

To my surprise, when I tried turning on the device, the screen displayed the message "Warning! This charger is not compatible with the Nintendo DS Lite. Use only the official Nintendo charger." I was shocked! I had never seen that message before.

I immediately unplugged the charger and turned off the device. I then went online to research what had just happened, and to my astonishment, I discovered that using an incompatible charger could cause the DS Lite to malfunction, or worse, completely ruin it.

I was in a panic. I had never heard of this before, and now I was afraid that I had damaged my gaming device. I decided to leave it off for a few hours, hoping that it would reset itself and start working again.

After a few hours, I tried turning it on again, and it worked! I was relieved that my DS Lite was still functioning correctly. I then decided to purchase an official Nintendo charger to avoid further damage.

This incident made me realize the importance of using the right charger for my gaming devices. I had taken it for granted and had always assumed that all chargers were compatible. It also made me appreciate the durability and reliability of Nintendo products.

In conclusion, it is essential to use the right charger for your gaming devices, to avoid causing any damage or internal malfunctions. I also learned that Nintendo products are built to last and can handle tough situations. So, next time, I will make sure to stick to the official charger and spare myself the trouble.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi.
My brother accidentaly got wet my DSL. It won't turn on. The LED turns green for 2-3 seconds, but DS doesn't do anything. When I set it to charge it's charging for 5-10 minutes and then the LED stops glowing. I've bought new battery, but it's not working.

 hi
sounds like your motherboard has blown, this can be repaired but it's pretty tricky to do this - you'd be better off buying a second hand motherboard and replacing it
note though that depending on how much water got in there, it may have also waterlogged the screens as well - if that's the case then you'd be better off buying another second hand ds - they're cheap enough on ebay these days
hope that helps

 Check the F2 fuse to see if its blown
