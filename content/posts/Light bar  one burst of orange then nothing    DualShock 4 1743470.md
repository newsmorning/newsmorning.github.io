Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When You Plug a Light Bar into Your Dualshock 4 - One Burst of Orange and Then Complete Darkness!

Introduction:

Gaming has evolved significantly over the years with the introduction of new technologies and gaming tools, such as the Dualshock 4 controller for PlayStation 4. In addition to the standard features, the Dualshock 4 gaming controller comes with some unique features like the light bar. The light bar is an additional feature that enhances gameplay and enhances the player's visual experience. But, what happens when you plug a light bar into your Dualshock 4? Letâ€™s find out.

Body:

When you connect a light bar to your Dualshock 4 controller, you will see a sudden change of color in the light bar. The light bar will light up with an intense orange color for a few seconds before it turns off. The orange glow is so bright that it attracts attention, and you may wonder what is happening to your controller. But don't worry, this is a common occurrence, and it is not harmful to your controller.

The orange light indicates that the light bar is in pairing mode, and it is ready to be paired with a PlayStation Camera or another Dualshock 4 controller. When you connect the light bar to your PlayStation Camera, the camera uses the light bar to track your controller's movements. However, some gamers prefer to disable the light bar as they find the bright light distracting. Besides, disabling the light bar can help to extend the battery life of the Dualshock 4 controller.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, connecting a light bar to your Dualshock 4 controller is not a complex task, and the orange light burst that you see is nothing to worry about. The light bar adds a unique touch to your gaming experience and is useful when paired with a PlayStation Camera. However, if you find the light bar distracting, you can disable it by accessing the settings on your PlayStation 4. In summary, the light bar adds some extra fun to your gaming experience, and you should try it out if you haven't already.

## Chosen Solution
 Recently I have swapped the analog sticks on my dual shock 4 because they had worn away.
After re-assembling the controller, it won't turn on without being plugged into the PS4 via USB. Once connected the controllers light bar, will pulses orange once and go black.
After this I can then connect the controller to the PS4, but only the X button will work, and the Triangle button will work, but act as the Circle button. None of the other buttons/analog sticks will work on the controller.
I have since re opened the controller, changed the ribbon connecting the light bar to the controller. But after changing this I've still got the same outcome.
I have also tried resetting the controller with the button next to the L2 trigger, but still the same result.
If you guys have any ideas on how to solve this, that be be amazing. Thanks =)

 Check if the battery is properly connected if not you might have damaged it.

 This might be a solution. It worked for me.
