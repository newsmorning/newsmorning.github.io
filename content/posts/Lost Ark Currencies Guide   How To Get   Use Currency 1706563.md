## Understanding the Currency System

Before we delve into the tips and tricks, let's first understand the currency system in Lost Ark. The game has three main currencies - Gold, Abyss, and Crystal Fragments. Gold is the most common currency that you can earn from quests, killing monsters, and trading items with other players. Abyss is a rarer currency that you can obtain from defeating bosses, completing dungeons, and opening treasure chests.
