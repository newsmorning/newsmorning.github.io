Title: SHOCKING! 2013-Present Nissan Altima Owners Left STRANDED as Lights Flicker and Car Shuts off Mid-Drive!

Subheading: A Problematic Nissan Altima Model

Introduction:

Have you ever been driving your Nissan Altima when suddenly the lights start flickering, and the car shuts down completely, leaving you stranded in the middle of the road? If you are one of the unfortunate Nissan Altima owners who have experienced this kind of situation, you are not alone.

Since 2013, Nissan has released several models of the Altima, and while most of these cars have received impressive reviews, some have encountered a critical problem that has placed drivers in a vulnerable position.

The Issue:

The problems reported by the Nissan Altima owners are not restricted to one particular model year or trim. The issue seems to be present across a broad range of Altima models, from the 2013 to the present ones.

Owners report that the car begins to malfunction after experiencing flickering headlights, dashboard lights, and other built-in electrical systems. In most cases, the car will eventually stop running completely, leaving the driver stranded and potentially in harm's way.

According to several accounts, the problem is not limited to a specific circumstance. It may happen when the car is idling, at a stop sign, or even in the middle of a high-speed drive.

The Nissan response:

The Nissan Altima is a trendy car model, and Nissan has taken pride in its vehicle's reliability and customer satisfaction. However, in light of these alarming complaints from drivers, Nissan dealerships have been flooded with inquiries and complaints regarding the malfunction.

When contacted about the situation, Nissan representatives initially denied that there was any issue specific to the Altima model. But as more and more drivers raised the concern, the company had no choice but to acknowledge the problem and offer some form of relief to affected Nissan Altima owners.

In a recent statement acknowledging the problem, Nissan said that they were aware of isolated instances of extreme issues with the Altima, which had caused the car to stall. They offered a solution by advising drivers to take their cars to a Nissan dealership to have an upgrade of the alternating current feed cable to the electronic control module. Sadly, the update is not reliable, and it does not prevent cars from repeatedly stall.

Conclusion:

Despite the effort by the company to address the issue, it seems like there is still no permanent solution to the problem. As we write this article, the only hope for drivers dealing with the issue is a recall by the company. However, no announcement has been made by Nissan on this subject. 

The Nissan Altima problem poses a significant risk of injuries, fatalities, and damage to property, and it is imperative that Nissan acts urgently and decisively to protect their vehicles and their customers. As we wait for a permanent solution, Nissan Altima drivers should be aware of the potential dangers of driving their cars and take precautionary measures to avoid stalling incidents.

## Chosen Solution
 Please watch the video, any help would be appreciated.

 Is the battery symbol (in red) on in the tachometer after starting? This usually means an electrical system problem; dead/discharged battery, broken/loose drive belt or belt tensioner, alternator fault or blown fusible link wire to the alternator or blown fuse in the engine fuse box.
Searching for Nissan Altima forums with members having the same model share free info dealers and repair shops aren’t willing to provide. If the red symbol is for the battery, either charge it or visit Autozone or similar auto parts store selling car batteries. They’re more likely to have battery testing equipment and may provide free battery testing in the vehicle or brought into their store. Alternators can be tested the same way. Look in the engine bay for a missing or loose serpentine drive belt. This drive belt supplies power for the power steering pump, water pump, alternator and ac compressor.

 This might be easy.
Notice how things change when you rev your engine? Your engine moves a bit when you rev it and that movement pull on hoses and wires  including the battery cable connectors. You said you just had your battery changed.
A couple of years ago I watched several helpful guys try to help two women start their vehicle. They  jumped the battery which started the engine but it died when they disconnected their cables. They ran extension cords to a battery charger and charged the battery for a while. Nothing. I went over and asked when the ladies began having starting trouble. Ever since they’d had their battery changed (on the road) just after they’d left on their trip. Hmm. I gave the battery connectors a healthy twist with my fingers and they both rotated! The ladies had some wrenches in the trunk which was all we needed to tighten up the cable connectors.
You may have the same problem. Almost all battery connectors are dirty, and show white and green chemical growth. When a battery is changed, somebody needs to spend some time cleaning all that stuff off and make sure the little nut that is designed to not be able to get a wrench on, is nice and tight. Try to twist it when you are done.
