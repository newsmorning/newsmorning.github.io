## Chosen Solution
 Let’s start with the fact it’s not my original Logic Board, and I don’t know it’s history. My LB died some time ago, I've ordered a couple of boards and began to inspect which of them will stay with me.
LB 2016, 2GHz - work’s fine
LB 2017, 2.3GHz - work’s. Except, it takes a while longer to boot (strange) and neither detects external screens or outputs any signal.
I’m more than certain it’s a LB’s fault, as it was tested on multiple dougles, multiple cables and two screens. What could be cause of that?
Kind Regards

 You’ve described exact symptoms of several cases I had and the truth is - it is more probable that those are the problems that are related to the HDMI output of your Thunderbolt 3.0 HUB, NOT those motherboards.
I have found that sometimes, mostly with those third party USB-C hubs, all that you need to do is to wait till your Macbook go to sleep turning the monitor off, and then, after waking up, your HUB’s HDMI will be recognized and used. If you will not disconnect that particular HUB from your Macbook, then it’s HDMI output will work from now on all the time. Sometimes you also have to power the HUB up to get the HDMI output, especially when there are power consuming devices connected to your HUB and in those cases where you have no valid battery and use 61W power adapter plugged in. All those things depend really mostly on on the particularities of your HUB.
For the slower boot “issue” I agree with Isaac - SMC and PRAM resets would most probably fix that.
