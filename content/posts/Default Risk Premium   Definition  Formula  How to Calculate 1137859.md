Introduction

Investing in financial markets is all about taking risks. The level of risk depends on a myriad of factors, one of which is credit risk. To compensate investors for the default risk that comes with investing in bonds and other debt securities, issuers offer a premium above the risk-free rate. This premium is known as the default risk premium (DRP). In this article, we will be discussing the hidden formula for calculating default risk like a pro.

What is Default Risk?

Default risk is the risk that an issuer of debt will default on its financial obligations. Debt instruments such as bonds, debentures, and commercial paper are all subject to default risk. Higher default risk leads to a higher interest rate, while lower default risk leads to lower interest rates.

What is Default Risk Premium?

Default risk premium is the extra return an investor receives for accepting the risk of buying a bond that is at risk of default. This premium is added to the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return investors can earn on a Treasury bond, without any credit risk. The default risk premium is inversely proportional to the creditworthiness of the issuer.

What Factors Contribute to Default Risk?

Several factors contribute to determining the default risk of a bond. Some of the critical factors are:

1. Creditworthiness of the issuer: The better the credit rating of the issuer, the lower the default risk.

2. Terms and conditions of the bond: The structure, maturity, hardening, etc., of the debt instrument can affect the default risk, for example, whether the bond is covered, senior, or subordinated.

3. Industry trends and market conditions: Economic trends, industry-specific events, and global market conditions significantly impact default risk.

4. Financial and business risks: fundamental factors such as leverage, profitability, revenue, and cash flow can impact default risk.

What Is the Formula for Default Risk Premium?

The formula for default risk premium is:

DRP = Yield on the bond - Yield on a risk-free asset

This formula calculates the premium the investor gets for taking on the extra risk of default in lending money to an organization. If an investor is buying corporate debt, for example, the yield will be higher than that of a Treasury bond.

How Do You Calculate Default Risk Premium Like a Pro?

To calculate the default risk premium like a pro, follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the Yield on the Bond

To find the yield on the bond, you can use the following formula:

Yield on the bond = (Interest payments+Principal payments - Purchase price) / Purchase price

Step 2: Identify a Risk-Free Asset

To calculate the default risk premium, you need the yield on a risk-free asset, such as a Treasury bond or a government-backed bond.

Step 3: Subtract the Yield on a Risk-Free Asset from the Yield on the Bond

This will give you your default risk premium.

Conclusion

Calculating the default risk premium is essential for investors looking to invest in fixed-income securities. It’s a part of the overall risk-reward equation that investors use to pick out favorable investment opportunities. By following the steps outlined in this article, investors can calculate the default risk premium like a pro, thereby making informed and superior investment decisions. Remember, the default risk premium is a function of many variables, and understanding the scenario under consideration is crucial to calculate the most accurate DRP.

## Default Risk Premium Definition
 
### Explanation
 
Default risk premium (DRP) works as compensatory payment to investors or lenders if, in any case, the borrower defaults on their debt. DRP is commonly applicable in the case of bonds. Any lender will charge a higher premium if there are chances that the borrower will default in meeting out its debt servicing, i.e., defaults in either recurring interest payments or principal amount as per the agreed terms and conditions. It acts as an incentive for the lender to get rewarded more for the risk undertaken.
 
### Purpose
 
If the lender assumes that the borrower can default in complying with its debt servicing terms and conditions, i.e., risk of non-payment, the lender may charge a higher DRP. Investors with poor credit records pay a greater interest rate to borrow money. If adequate DRP is not available, an investor will not invest in companies more prone to default. If a company depicts lower default riskDefault RiskDefault risk is a form of risk that measures the likelihood of not fulfilling obligations, such as principal or interest repayment, and is determined mathematically based on prior commitments, financial conditions, market conditions, liquidity position, and current obligations, among other factors.read more, this, in turn, will lower the future cost of raising capital for the company as such companies will get funds at lower DRP. The government does not pay a default premium except in unfavorable conditions to attract investors and pay higher yields.

DRP = Interest Rate Charged by Lender – Risk-Free Rate of Interest
 
DRP = Total Interest Charged – Other Component Of Interest
 
DRP is the difference between the Risk-Free RateRisk-Free RateA risk-free rate is the minimum rate of return expected on investment with zero risks by the investor. It is the government bonds of well-developed countries, either US treasury bonds or German government bonds. Although, it does not exist because every investment has a certain amount of risk.read more and the Interest Rate charged by the lender. The interest rate comprises the following components – Inflation premium, maturity premium, liquidity premiumLiquidity PremiumLiquidity premium refers to the extra compensation desired by the investors for holding assets that are either difficult to be converted into cash or tradable in the open market at a fair price.read more, risk-free rate, and DRP. The risk-free rate is based on an asset that possesses no risk. DRP generally deals with treasury bonds, as the US government backs these bonds. The default risk premium is the amount above the rate of treasury bonds that any investor would like to earn on an investment
 
### How to Calculate Default Risk Premium?
 
DRP is the estimated return on a bond reduced by a risk-free return rate on investment. To calculate the DRP of a bond, the bond’s coupon rateCoupon Rate The coupon rate is the ROI (rate of interest) paid on the bond's face value by the bond's issuers. It determines the repayment amount made by GIS (guaranteed income security). Coupon Rate = Annualized Interest Payment / Par Value of Bond * 100%read more needs to be reduced by a risk-free return rate. It can be understood through the following steps.
 
- Step 1 – The rate of return for risk-free investment should be determined. The principal amount will grow with inflation while reducing deflationDeflationDeflation is defined as an economic condition whereby the prices of goods and services go down constantly with the inflation rate turning negative. The situation generally emerges from the contraction of the money supply in the economy.read more, and the US government backs the security. Say the rate of risk-free security is 1%.Step 2 – If a corporate bond that we wish to purchase offers 10% of the annual rate of return, then subtracting treasury’s rate of return from a corporate bondCorporate BondCorporate Bonds are fixed-income securities issued by companies that promise periodic fixed payments. These fixed payments are broken down into two parts: the coupon and the notional or face value.read more will be 10% – 1%, that is 9%.Step 3 – Now, the estimated rate of inflationRate Of InflationThe rate of inflation formula helps understand how much the price of goods and services in an economy has increased in a year. It is calculated by dividing the difference between two Consumer Price Indexes(CPI) by previous CPI and multiplying it by 100.read more will be subtracted from the above difference. If inflation is estimated to be 4%, the value will be 9% – 4%, 5%.Step 4 – If any other premium is included in the bond-like liquidity premiums, subtract those premiums. For example, if the bond carries a liquidity premium of 1%, subtracting 1% from 4% will arrive at 3% of the default risk premium.

 
### Example
 
ZYDUS Ltd. is issuing bonds with a 10% annual percentage yield. Now, suppose the risk-free rate is 1%. In that case, inflation of that particular year is estimated to be around 3%, and the liquidity and maturity premiums of the bonds are both 1%, adding all of these together with the sum totals to 6%. Hence, this bond’s default risk premium equals 4% of the annual percentage yield (10%) – other interest components (6%).
 
Solution
 
Here,
 
- The total Interest charged is 10%Other components of interest = (risk-free rate + inflation rate + liquidity premium + maturity premium)

 
- = 10% – (1%+3% + 1% + 1% )= 10% – 6%DRP =  4%

 
### Factors that Determine Default Risk Premium
 
The following are the factors that determine DRP –
 
- Credit History – Any entity is considered trustworthy if it has paid previous debts on time with interest payments. Such companies or individuals are presumed to have lower default risk, and therefore they get access to cheaper funds as lenders charge lower DRP from them.Credit Worthiness – Companies with poor credit ratings and lower-grade bonds pay more default risk premiums. The companies are rated based on their financial performance by rating agencies such as Moody’s, Fitch, and S&P. Better the financial performance is the credit rating. Higher credit rating results in a lower default risk premium, and hence the investor would not get high returns since the risk is less.Liquidity and Profitability – The company’s profitabilityProfitabilityProfitability refers to a company's ability to generate revenue and maximize profit above its expenditure and operational costs. It is measured using specific ratios such as gross profit margin, EBITDA, and net profit margin. It aids investors in analyzing the company's performance.read more helps banks know their creditworthiness before giving loans. The cash flows are examined to determine if the company has enough cash to meet its interest obligations.

 
### Advantages
 
- With a high default risk premium, the market compensates investors more for undertaking greater risk by investing in such companies.Novel and risky business investments offer above-average returns, which the borrower can use as an earning reward for investors on investment risk.The riskier a particular asset is, the greater is the required return from that asset.DRP helps assign a relative risk rating to a particular asset for the investor.DRP helps determine the level of risk an investor or lender has to undergo if a borrower defaults on the loan.
