Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When You Replace Your iPhone 5S Home Button - Warning: Shocking!

Introduction:

The iPhone 5S was once a coveted device, and many people owned and cherished it. However, like all technology, it has started to age, and as a result, it may require replacement parts. One of those parts is the home button, which unlocks the phone and acts as a primary navigation tool. But, have you ever wondered what happens when you replace the iPhone 5S home button? It may shock you!

Body:

Replacing the home button on an iPhone 5S is a delicate process. Apple products are notorious for their tight security measures, and the home button is no exception. Several security protocols are linked to the home button, and they can become compromised if the replacement button is not installed correctly. For instance, if you use a third-party vendor to replace the home button, the Touch ID feature may become disabled. It's a significant safety concern because the Touch ID is required to make contactless payments, which means anyone can access your funds.

Another problem that arises from replacing the home button is the 'Error 53' message. An error 53 message is an indication that the Touch ID has been compromised, and the iPhone's security system has detected a breach. It can happen when you change your home button, and it can render your iPhone useless. Your iPhone will be locked, and a message will appear stating that 'the iPhone is disabled try again in X minutes.'

In other instances, the replacement home button can cause a water damage issue. The way Apple designs the iPhone 5S is that the home button is a separate component from the screen. As a result, the water resistance feature can become compromised if there is a space between the home button and the iPhone casing. Once water gets in, it can cause severe damage to the phone's interior, rendering it unusable.

Lastly, replacing the home button can also cause a battery drain issue. In some instances, the battery lifespan will reduce drastically, and you will have to replace the battery as well. It's an added expense and an inconvenience.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, replacing the home button on an iPhone 5S may seem like a simple and straightforward process, but it's far from it. The consequences of replacing the button can be severe, and it's a risk to undertake lightly. It's essential to use an authorized Apple technician to replace the home button or better yet, upgrade to a more recent iPhone model. Remember, technology is always evolving, and it's worth investing in a more secure and up-to-date device.

## Chosen Solution
 Recently I had purchased an iPhone 5s from a friend and I decided to fix the phone myself and replace the missing home button. I bought a home button from eBay and amazon and connected the cable but it said that the Touch ID did not work.
This is not my first time fixing a 5s as I own a 5s that I've changed the screen a few times. I've reconnected the cord multiple times and disconnected it but the Touch ID continuously does not work.
I wanted to know how come this issue occurs ? And is there anywhere I can purchase a few home buttons that will work with Touch ID because the ones that I've had, do no simply work.

 The Touch ID button and the logic board are paired. Only the original button will work with the logic board.
Be warned. If the phone is updated it will show error (53)? And will become unusable if any home button besides the original is installed.

 iPhone 5s was released 3 years ago and it was immediately known that if you replace home button, you kill Touch ID.
There is nothing you can do except keeping your knowledge up to date.
