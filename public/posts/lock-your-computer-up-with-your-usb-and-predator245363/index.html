With the rise of cybercrime and online attacks, it is important to ensure that your personal information is secure. One of the most effective ways to protect your privacy is by using a USB and Predator to lock down your computer against intruders.\nFor those not familiar, Predator is a free Windows application that turns your USB drive into a key that unlocks your computer. It works by installing a small program on your computer and configuring a USB stick as a “key”. Once you activate the program, your computer can only be accessed when the USB drive is inserted. Without the key, your computer remains locked and your data remains safe.\nHere are some tips on how to use Predator to protect your privacy:\nDownload and Install Predator The first step is to download Predator from their website and install the program on your computer. Once you have installed Predator, plug in your USB drive.\nConfiguration Open the Predator program and go through the configuration steps. First, set a password for your Predator key. Next, set the timeout period - this is how long your computer will remain unlocked after the USB drive is removed. The default setting is 30 seconds, but you can increase or decrease it as needed.\nLock Your Computer Once you have completed the configuration, click on the “Create Key” button to create your Predator key. As soon as you do this, your computer will lock, and you will see the Predator icon in your system tray.\nUnlock Your Computer When you need to access your computer, insert your USB key into your computer’s USB port. The Predator icon in the system tray will turn green, indicating that the USB key is detected and your computer is unlocked. When you are finished, remove the USB key, and your computer will lock down again.\nIn conclusion, data privacy is a significant concern in today’s world. Using Predator in conjunction with a USB drive is a simple and effective way to lock down your computer and protect your personal information. With these few simple steps, you can enjoy peace of mind and assurance that your data is safe from intruders. Protect your privacy NOW by using this simple and effective USB and Predator technique!\nIt’s your computer, and you want to keep your files private, so you have a master password to access your desktop. A master password keeps your computer data safe, prying eyes at bay, and your teenagers from going into a chat room (if they use the same computer, of course).\nBut let’s face it: passwords are becoming passé. As technology progresses, so does the ease of cracking a password; some of the best hackers in the world are teenagers, and if they want to get into your computer, they can do it.\nThat’s not to say you should quit using passwords; until there’s a way to replace them, you need to keep on doing it. But there’s another way to keep your computer secure. All you need is a USB flash drive and a piece of software called Predator.\nPredator Predator is an ingenious concept when it comes to personal computer security. It locks your PC when you are away and uses a regular USB flash drive as an access control device. If you’re even a little worried about your privacy, keep everybody out of your business with Predator.\nPredator has both Home and Professional editions. Choose the one that’s best for you, and don’t forget to obtain the correct version for your computer, e.g. 32-bit or 64-bit.\nDownload Predator. It will download in a .zip file; save the file if you want to install it later, or open it with your favorite .zip program.\nWhen you open the file, double-click on InstallPredator.exe to begin installation.\nThe installation will bring you to the Predator Setup Wizard. Click Next to continue.\nWhen the installation is finished, Predator will automatically launch. If it doesn’t, launch it from your Start Menu. When it does, you will see this dialog box.\nInsert your USB flash drive and click on OK. (Note: this will not change the files on your flash drive in any way.)\nNow you come to the Preferences window. Create and enter a strong password (no less than six characters), and choose the drive you want the key to be on from the drop-down menu. Click on Create Key, and click on OK (top right).\nYou will then have to restart Predator, so click on Ok in the dialog box to do so.\nClick on the Predator icon on your desktop or in your Start Menu to re-open it. Notice that you now have a have a blinking green ball in the system tray.\nNow you should get into all the neat features by reading the User’s Guide. It will tell you what to do when you run the program for the first time and all the neat features it provides after that.\n(By the way, if you don’t want to use a USB drive, you can use a Floppy drive. The User’s manual will tell you how.)\nGreat Security Features Predator has a host of security features that you will love.\nIf somebody enters three invalid passwords or the password dialog times out, Predator will trigger an alarm. You can configure how loud or how many beeps the alarm has.\nIf you have the Access Denied box checked, then the alarm goes off.\nPredator keeps a log of everything: when it is started, when it is stopped, when alarms go off if someone is trying to get into your computer. You can use this log to monitor what’s going on with your computer while you’re away.\nSpeaking of which, do you have a web cam? Predator can be configured to take a picture of every person that tries to access your computer.\nAnd there’s more.\nPredator can send you email alerts when someone is trying to access your computer. Configure it so that it sends a picture of the person with the email as well. Predator will automatically change the codes on your USB flash drive. If someone copies it, then it won’t work because the codes on your flash drive will have been changed. It’s kind of like using the wrong set of keys to get into your house. Predator will protect more than one personal computer. If you want one for your office and your home, then you can configure each the way you want to. Not only does Predator keep the people that want into your computer away, it will tell you in a lot of ways who it is. You’ll have actual proof, which is a lot easier than proving who cracked your password.\nKeep nosy people physically away by using your USB flash drive and Predator. And have fun with it! You could blow up the picture of your son when he’s trying to get into your computer and hand it to him at dinner, saying, “Perhaps you ought to stick to your own computer because I’ll always know when you’re trying to get into mine.“\nLori is a web content creator (fancy title for freelance writer), a self-professed tech nerd and personal computer tech; some people regard her as “tech obsessed”.
