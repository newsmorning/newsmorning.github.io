Find Out Why High Beam Headlights Are Failing While Low Beams Shine Bright! Introduction Nissan Altima is a mid-size car that has been manufactured by Japanese automaker Nissan since 1992. It is known for its sleek design, comfortable ride, and fuel efficiency. However, many Nissan Altima owners have been facing a common issue lately - the high beam headlights are failing while low beams shine bright. This issue has left many Nissan Altima drivers in the dark, quite literally. In this article, we will explore what may be causing this problem and what you can do to fix it.\nCommon Causes There can be several reasons why the high beams on your Nissan Altima are not working while the low beams are. Let’s take a look at some of the most common causes -\nBurnt Out Bulbs The most common reason for high beams failing is burnt-out bulbs. If the headlight bulb has reached the end of its lifespan, it won’t work properly. A burnt-out bulb can be easily identified as it won’t light up, and the filament inside the bulb may look broken or damaged.\nFailing Relay A faulty relay in your Altima’s headlight system can also cause high beam failure while low beams work perfectly fine. A relay is a small electronic component that controls the electrical current in the car’s headlight system. When a relay fails, it can cause the high beams to stop working or not work at all.\nFaulty Switch If the high beams on your Nissan Altima are not working, the switch that controls them could be faulty. The switch could be broken, or a connection may be loose, preventing it from activating the high beam headlights.\nWiring Issues Another possible cause of high beams failing on your Nissan Altima could be faulty wiring in the headlight system. Damaged or corroded wires can interfere with the electrical current and cause the high beams to fail.\nWhat Can You Do? If your Nissan Altima’s high beams are not working while the low beams are shining bright, there is no need to worry. Solutions to the problem will depend on the underlying cause of the issue. Here are some of the things that you can do -\nReplace the Bulbs If the high beam headlights on your Nissan Altima are burnt out, replacing the bulbs is the easiest fix. Ensure that you replace both headlight bulbs at the same time as they tend to have a similar lifespan.\nCheck the Relays If a faulty relay is to blame for your Altima’s high beams not working, you may need to replace the relay to fix the issue. Relays are often cheap and easily accessible, so this should not be a challenging task.\nTest the Switch If you think the switch may be causing the high beams to fail, you can test its functionality using a multimeter. If the switch is indeed faulty, you should consider replacing it.\nCheck the Wiring If the problem lies with the wiring in the headlight system, it is best to consult with an auto-electrician to diagnose and fix the problem. Damaged wires can be a little more complicated to fix yourself.\nConclusion Driving a Nissan Altima without properly functioning headlights can be dangerous. It is essential to diagnose and fix the issue promptly. In this article, we have explored the common causes of high beam failure in Nissan Altima’s and what you can do to fix them. Remember, if you are not comfortable performing any of the suggested repairs, it is always best to consult with a qualified professional to avoid causing further damage to your vehicle.\nChosen Solution I have a 2005 Altima in Canada with a Running Lights Module. Checked the fuses but the High beams don’t seem to work, and only the low beams seem to work.\n@raezorsharp check the headlamp high relay, located in the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room). “High Beam Operation/Flash-to-Pass Operation With the lighting switch in 2ND position and placed in HIGH or PASS position, the BCM (body control module) receives input requesting the headlamp high beams to illuminate. This input is communicated to the IPDM E/R (intelligent power distribution module engine room) across the CAN communication lines. The central processing unit of the IPDM E/R controls the headlamp high relay coil. When energized, this relay directs power to 10A fuse [No. 47, located in the IPDM]through terminal 24 of the IPDM\nto terminal 1 of headlamp RH, and to 10A fuse [No. 48, located in the IPDM]through terminal 22 of the IPDMto terminal 1 of headlamp LH. Ground is supplied to terminal 2 of headlamp RHthrough body grounds E15 and E24, andto terminal 2 of headlamp LHthrough body grounds E15 and E24. With power and ground supplied, the high beam headlamps and the HIGH BEAM indicator illuminate. For proper troubleshooting check the lighting part of the FSM Altima-Lighting-.pdf which does included the Canadian lighting system\n","wordCount":"831","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Scott Holman"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/high-beam-headlights-don-t-work-only-the-low-beam-headlight-works-2002-2006-nissan-altima-573709/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your Nissan Altima in the Dark?
