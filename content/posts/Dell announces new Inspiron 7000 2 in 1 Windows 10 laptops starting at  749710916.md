COMPUTEX 2016 is the perfect event for technology manufacturers to introduce new devices. Dell took advantage of this opportunity and announced three new Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 Windows 10 laptops with very affordable price tags.
 
All three laptops are powered by Intel’s 6th generation processors. The laptops come in different sizes: you can choose from a 13, 15 or a 17-inch laptop, with the latter being the world’s first 17-inch 2-in-1 laptop. As such, Dell is paving the way for other manufacturers to follow.
 
These laptops are versatile and flexible thanks to the 360-degree hinge that enables four modes you can choose from depending on your activities. The laptop mode is the best choice for typing, the tent mode is good for working on a presentation, the stand mode can be used for streaming movies, and the tablet mode can be used for social media activities.
 
All the laptops support new Windows 10 features, such as the personal digital assistant Cortana or Windows Hello. All three devices are equipped with touch screens, so you can take advantage of unique experiences like as marking up webpages in Microsoft Edge.
 

 
These notebooks are equipped with precision touch pads for accurate pointing and gesture recognition. Other features include:
 
- Wide-viewing angle screens with FHD resolution
 - Infrared camera
 - Standard backlit keyboard
 - USB Type C ports
 - Standard Waves MaxxAudio Pro audio software for excellent multimedia experiences
 - Quicker, quieter, more shock resistant SSDs.

 
The Inspiron 13, 15 & 17 7000 2-in-1 laptops will be available for purchasing starting June 2 on Dell’s official website in the United States and China. Dell announced prices would start at $749, but did not offer any information about the price of the 17-inch laptop. As this is the world’s first 17-inch 2-in-1 laptop, Dell will basically set the pricing trend for this device. It all depends on the full specs, but we do expect to see a price tag of around $1,500.
