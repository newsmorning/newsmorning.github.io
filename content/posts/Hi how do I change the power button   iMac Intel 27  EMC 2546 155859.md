## Chosen Solution
 Hi I while changing the hard drive i pulled the cable from the power button by mistake can you tell me how to get to it so I can fix it?

 You’ll need to strip down the system quite far to make room.
The button is hot glued to the case. You’ll need a heat gun to soften the glue to get it off and then you should be able to solder on a new set of wires splicing the lines to the old cable end.
