## Chosen Solution
 Adding second SSD to HP 24 AIO not detected on BIOS
So entering the BIOS there's no place I can spot where I can see the Hard Drives, only in the HP System Diagnostics the Boot/Main SSD is shown as Nvme, but the board has an unused SATA connector I plugged a second SSD onto. It's just like if the BIOS has wiped the whole section where you define the storage devices....
So is there any way to make the BIOS re-add the missing features? Aka has anyone performed this before with an alternate BIOS maybe?
Update (12/31/2022)
It's HP All-In-One - 24-Df0006ns

 Hi,
Not sure if it is applicable in your PC but in BIOS check under Security > Device Security and see if the sata ports are shown as available or hidden
