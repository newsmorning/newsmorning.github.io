# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Splice Your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Four! Get The Ultimate Gaming Experience Now!

As a gamer, you know how important it is to have the best possible audio setup. You need to be able to hear every footstep and gunshot in order to stay ahead of the competition. But, if you don't have a lot of money to spend on fancy gaming headsets, don't worry! There is a way to upgrade your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Four headset and get the ultimate gaming experience for a fraction of the cost.

By splicing your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Four with a better quality cable, you can improve your audio quality immensely. This simple modification will allow you to enjoy your games in a whole new way.

So, how do you do it? Don't worry, it's easier than you might think. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Purchase a high-quality auxiliary cable. You can find these online or at your local electronics store. Make sure to buy a cable that has gold-plated connectors for optimal audio quality.

2. Remove the ear cups from your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Four. This will allow you to access the wires inside the headset.

3. Cut the original cable on your headset, leaving about an inch or two of wire attached to the ear cup. Do the same for the new auxiliary cable.

4. Strip the wires on both cables to expose the bare copper wires.

5. Twist the wires of the new auxiliary cable with the wires of the original cable. Make sure that the copper wires are touching each other tightly.

6. Wrap each wire connection with electrical tape to ensure that there is no interference between the wires.

7. Reattach the ear cups to your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Four.

That's it! You have now successfully spliced your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Four with a high-quality auxiliary cable. You'll notice the difference in sound quality immediately. Your games will sound more immersive and you'll be able to hear even the quietest sounds with clarity.

So, if you want to take your gaming experience to the next level, try splicing your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO Four with a high-quality auxiliary cable. You won't believe how easy it is, and the difference in sound quality will be well worth the effort. Happy gaming!

## Chosen Solution
 My turtle beach is broken at the jack so I decided to try and splice it with the jack from a working pair of headphones, but I'm completely confused. The turtle beach seems to have 4 wires (red, green, copper, and a red/green twist that had a copper outer layer that I untwisted) and the one I wanted to splice it to seems to have 5 wires (blue, green, red/copper twist, green/copper twist, and solid red with a copper outer layer) so I don't know where to go from here.  I took some pictures to show what I mean. Help is much appreciated.

Wire I'm trying to splice to:

 Hello,
I’m not familiar with the 5 wire picture you posted  but i repaired a few turtle beach headsets in my days and if i’m not mistaken on your turtle beach …The red is right audio and green left audio. The copper wire is ground , the red/green is mic and the copper around that wire is also ground. You can solder a new 3.5 mm jack to these wires. The jack has four soldering points (starting from top to bottom) where 1=left audio 2=right audio 3 = the two grounds and 4=mic.
hope this helps,
Luis

 There isn’t really a standard for wire colors in headphone wires.  While many manufacturers use similar coloring, you should still test each wire individually to see what it’s connected to. As for the 5th wire, it could be a mic cable, or just an extra that leads nowhere. In any case you shouldn’t lose functionality as long as the other 4 match and the pinout on the new jack is the same.
