## Chosen Solution
 Asus chromebook medel C423N
I plug in my charger and the light turns white then quickly turns orange, then the light turns off. Laptop won't turn on.
Tried holding the power button.
Tried holding refresh and power.
Charger works when I plug it in to my phone
Battery is built in and can't be taken out.
None of that works, please help

 My educated guess is that it could be an issue with the battery. Best case scenario is that the cable needs to be reseated, and worse case scenario the battery would need to be replaced. There isn't a guide on iFixit Yet, but there is a teardown guide on YouTube that gives you a good idea on how to get to the battery. I'll link it here for you to view.
