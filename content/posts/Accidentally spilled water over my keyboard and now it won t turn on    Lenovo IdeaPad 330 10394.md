It was a typical Sunday morning, and I was relaxing on my couch with my Lenovo Ideapad 330. Suddenly, I reached for a glass of water, and before I even realized it, I knocked it over, spilling water all over my laptop's keyboard. 

My first instinct was to panic. I immediately turned off my computer, unplugged it, and started dabbing the keyboard with a towel. But deep down, I knew the damage had already been done, and I was terrified that my laptop was now permanently damaged.

After a few minutes of research online, I discovered that water damage to a laptop keyboard can cause serious issues, such as malfunctioning keys, sticky keys, or a non-functional keyboard altogether. I tried to keep calm but felt frustrated and uncertain about what to do next.

I decided to take my Lenovo Ideapad 330 to the nearest repair shop. The technicians told me that they needed to remove the keyboard to inspect the internal components for any damage. I was anxious to know the extent of the damage, but the repair diagnosis did not look promising.

The technician reported that water had seeped into the inner components of the keyboard, causing corrosion to start. This meant that I would need to replace the keyboard. I was devastated as I knew it could be expensive and time-consuming.

However, I was relieved to find out that the repair would only take a few hours, and the cost was not as high as I feared.

In the end, my Lenovo Ideapad 330 keyboard was replaced, and it functioned perfectly after the repair. This experience taught me a valuable lesson about taking care of my laptop and being mindful of where I place liquids around it.

To avoid a similar incident, I recommend that you keep your laptop away from liquids or drinks. It’s also crucial to turn off your laptop immediately if you accidentally spill water or any liquid on it. Additionally, contact a professional repair technician if you suspect water damage.

In conclusion, if you spill water on your Lenovo Ideapad 330 keyboard, don't panic. Seek professional help from an authorized repair technician, and with a little bit of patience and luck, your laptop can be repaired with ease.

## Chosen Solution
 Okay, before you call me an idiot, I already know.
It was a half a cup of tap water and it spilled all over my keyboard while it was on & connected to a charger.
I dried it out, fully from what I know of, and let it sit by itself on the desk flat down so extra water could get out. Thing is dry as the desert. I turned it on and the keyboard light activated, I can hear the fan,  but the screen isn’t turning at all. Any ideas? I can’t afford a replacement and I need this to do school & work due to the pandemic resulting in my school closing for remote learning.

 Hi,
As you know water and electronics and electricity are not a good mix.
The impurities in the water causes corrosion and provides circuit paths for the electricity which were not in the laptop’s operating design and could damage the components.
The corrosion is ongoing until it is cleaned away
First do not turn on your laptop and then you need to disconnect the battery as soon as possible from the laptop systemboard to minimize any further damage.
Then you need to inspect the rest of the laptop and  clean all the affected parts using Isopropyl Alcohol 99%+ (available from electronics parts stores) to remove all traces of corrosion and water. Do not use "rubbing alcohol" as in some cases this is only 70% IPA or less, can contain scents or other additives and is not as effective. If you do use it check the label to verify the  amount of IPA. The higher the IPA percentage the better
Here is a link that describes the process.
Electronics Water Damage
As always with electronics, especially surface mounted PCBs be gentle when handling and especially when brushing away the corrosion. You do not want to remove any components from the board.
Hopefully after you have done all this the laptop might possibly work correctly again.
Here is a link to the hardware maintenance manual for the laptop which should be of some help in the dis-assembly process so that the laptop can be inspected and cleaned etc
If this process seems too daunting, contact a reputable, professional laptop repair service, experienced in liquid damage repair and ask for a quote for a repair. If you decide to do this, do it sooner than later.
