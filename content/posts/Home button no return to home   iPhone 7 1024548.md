You Won't Believe What Happens When You Press the Home Button on Your iPhone 7 - Say Goodbye to the Home Screen!

Have you ever wondered what would happen if you pressed the home button on your iPhone 7? Well, you might be surprised to know that Apple has introduced a new feature that completely changes the way you navigate your iPhone.

Traditionally, the home button has been used to return you to the main screen of your device. But now, with the iPhone 7, pressing the home button brings up a whole new world of possibilities. Instead of being taken to the home screen, you are now greeted with a brand new full-screen interface called the App Switcher.

The App Switcher is essentially a new way of multitasking on your iPhone. Instead of swiping between apps on the home screen, you can now access all of your open apps in one place. Simply press the home button once, and you'll be presented with a full-screen view of your most recently used applications.

But that's not all - the App Switcher also allows for quick and easy app switching. You can now swipe left or right to navigate through your open apps, and tap on any app to bring it to the foreground. This new feature makes it easier than ever to switch between your most frequently used applications.

The App Switcher also offers a number of other convenient features. For example, if you want to close an app, you can simply swipe up on the app's card to close it. And if you want to see all of your open applications at once, you can swipe up from the bottom of the App Switcher to see all open apps.

One of the biggest benefits of this new feature is that it makes the home button on your iPhone 7 even more useful. Instead of just serving as a way to return to the home screen, the home button now offers a variety of powerful options that can simplify your day-to-day use of your device.

So, whether you're a power user who needs to switch between a lot of different applications throughout the day, or just someone who wants a more convenient way to navigate their phone, the App Switcher on the iPhone 7 is definitely worth exploring. It may take a little getting used to, but once you do, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a IP7 with no Touch ID or home button working.
I changed for a JC home button yet I get no response with single click/return to home or long press. There is also no response through home button settings.
The only response I get is from double click with half screen. I tried another JC home but still have the same problem. The buttons work ok in another IP7. I did get a message flash up once that the home button needs servicing as I was tired and dumb enough to leave the battery connected but haven’t seen that since.
I tried a dfu restore through iTunes. Could I rollback IOS through 3utools? Would this help?
Any help guys please as I’m baffled

 There may be some damage to the screen, specifically the flex that runs underneath  the heat shield and connects the actual Home button to the logic board. Seeing as how you have two devices, try the working screen/Home button combo on the first device to see if that solves the problem.
