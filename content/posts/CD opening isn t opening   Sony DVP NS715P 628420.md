# Whaaat?! CD Opening Stuck on Sony DVP NS715P - Fix it Now with This Simple Trick!

If you’re a Sony DVP NS715P user, you might have faced the issue of a stuck CD opening. It can be frustrating when you’re trying to watch your favorite movie or listen to your favorite album, and the CD opening just won't budge. Don't worry; this problem is quite common in this particular model, and there's an easy fix that you can do at home without the need for professional help.

Here's what you need to do:

## Step 1:
Make sure the device is unplugged from the power supply before attempting any repairs.

## Step 2:
Locate the small hole on the front panel of the device. This hole is the manual eject button.

## Step 3:
Using a pointed object such as a paper clip, gently insert it into the hole and press the button. If done correctly, the CD tray should start to open.

## Step 4:
Once the CD tray is open, remove the CD or any foreign objects that may be inside.

## Step 5:
Close the CD tray and then plug the device back into the power supply. Test to ensure that the CD tray now opens and closes smoothly.

In most cases, this simple trick should be sufficient to fix the stuck CD opening issue. However, if the problem persists, you may need to seek professional help.

The Sony DVP NS715P is a reliable and well-built device, but like any other electronic gadget, it can develop issues. Knowing how to deal with them can save you time, frustration, and money.

In conclusion, if you own a Sony DVP NS715P and the CD opening is stuck, don’t panic. Try the manual eject button as described above, and chances are it will fix the problem. If it doesn’t, consult a professional. Remember to always follow safety procedures and disconnect the device from the power supply before attempting any repairs.

## Chosen Solution
 CD opening isn't opening

 Ali HD1 you really did not give us a lot of information. It sounds like you are saying that your tray is not opening. You should also tell us more about the history of this and what you have tried thus far to fix this. I suggest that you run the Test mode to see if you can make a better diagnosis on what has failed.
