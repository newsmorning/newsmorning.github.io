## Chosen Solution
 This computer (and the keyboard that came with it) is only 4/5 months old.
I noticed my V key was sticking.  Since I’ve used Mac for a while and had to clean and reattach keys before, I figured I could do it again.  I took the key off and cleaned it but when I attempt to replace it, it stays stuck down.  It will not bounce back up.  Like an imbecile, I took off the neighboring key to see if I could figure it out.
Long story short….I now have two keys off that I can’t put back on correctly.  Does anyone know what I did wrong and how to correctly reattach?  Videos I watched on YouTube do not have the clips oriented the same as the keyboard I have now.
