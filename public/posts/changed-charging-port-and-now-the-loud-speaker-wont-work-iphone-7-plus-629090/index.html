As an iPhone user, one of the most frustrating problems that you can encounter is a malfunctioning charging port. This simple issue can have a significant impact on the functionality of your device. However, what happens when replacing the charging port also fixes a completely unrelated problem like loudspeaker sound?\nThat’s precisely what happened to one iPhone 7 Plus user. After noticing that their device’s charging port was not working correctly, they decided to replace it. To their surprise, not only did the new charging port work, but it also fixed the loudspeaker sound issue they had been experiencing.\nWhy Did This Happen?\nMany iPhone 7 Plus users have reported issues with their loudspeaker sound, with some claiming that it’s barely audible. The reason for this problem is believed to be related to a malfunctioning audio ic chip on the device’s motherboard. This chip controls the audio functions of the phone, including sound output.\nReplacing the charging port may not seem like an obvious solution to an audio issue, but here’s how it works. The loudspeaker uses the same flexible cable as the charging port, which connects to the main board of the device. When this cable is damaged or failing, it can impact both the charging port and the loudspeaker.\nReplacing the charging port involves getting access to the flexible cable, and this can help determine whether or not it’s damaged. Once the damaged cable is removed and replaced with a new one, the charging port and loudspeaker should work again.\nWhy Should You Consider Replacing Your Charging Port?\nThis case serves as a reminder that the charging port is an essential component of your iPhone, and when it’s damaged, it can cause multiple issues. Replacing it can improve the functionality of your device in many ways, and even fix issues you didn’t know were connected to it.\nAdditionally, leaving a damaged charging port can lead to more significant problems, like battery drain or even short circuits. Therefore, it’s crucial to get it fixed as soon as possible.\nIn conclusion, the story of the iPhone 7 Plus user who fixed their loudspeaker sound issue by replacing the charging port is a fascinating one. It highlights the importance of having your iPhone examined by a professional when something is not working correctly. Don’t wait until things get worse. Get your device checked today, and get back to enjoying all of its benefits!\nChosen Solution Double checked connections and made sure everything had good contact and still doesn’t work.\nHi Javier, have you made sure to plug the antennas in correctly? They can be quite fiddly to get back into the sockets, or any possibility you could have damaged them during the removal process? Replacement loud speakers are really cheap to get online.\n","wordCount":"482","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Antonio Vincent"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/changed-charging-port-and-now-the-loud-speaker-wont-work-iphone-7-plus-629090/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe What Happened When This Person Changed Their iPhone 7 Plus Charging Port - No More Loudspeaker Sound!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;482 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Antonio Vincent</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=you-wont-believe-what-happened-when-this-person-changed-their-iphone-7-plus-charging-port---no-more-loudspeaker-sound>You Won&rsquo;t Believe What Happened When This Person Changed Their iPhone 7 Plus Charging Port - No More Loudspeaker Sound!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-wont-believe-what-happened-when-this-person-changed-their-iphone-7-plus-charging-port---no-more-loudspeaker-sound>#</a></h1><p>As an iPhone user, one of the most frustrating problems that you can encounter is a malfunctioning charging port.
