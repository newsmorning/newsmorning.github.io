If you are a fan of RPG games, then you must have heard of Elden Ring, the upcoming action-packed RPG game from FromSoftware. With its release just around the corner, the anticipation among gamers is at an all-time high. For those unfamiliar with the game, Elden Ring is an open-world action RPG that offers endless possibilities for character customization, making it a popular title for gamers looking to explore and experiment with multiple strategies.\nOne of the key factors that contribute to the appeal of Elden Ring is the extensive range of character building options available to players. Whether you are a melee combat enthusiast or a ranged magic user, Elden Ring offers something for everyone. To help you get started, we have compiled a comprehensive list of some of the most robust and effective character builds that you can try out in the game.\nThe Melee Tank Build If you prefer a closer range combat style, then the Melee Tank Build is perfect for you. With this build, you can easily deflect incoming enemy attacks with your tanky armor and take massive swings at your enemy to take them down. This build primarily focuses on strength and endurance stats while also improving your defense capabilities.\nThe Magic Rogue Build For gamers who prefer to take out their enemies from a safe distance, the Magic Rogue Build is the perfect choice. The build focuses on magic skills and dexterity stats that allow you to effectively cast spells and dodge enemy attacks. With this build, you can easily avoid any shield-wielding or heavily armored enemies, all while taking them down from a distance.\nThe Balanced Build For players who want a bit of everything, the Balanced Build is the perfect choice. This build offers a balance of strength, dexterity, and endurance, allowing you to handle any situation that you may encounter in the game. This is an all-around excellent choice that offers a versatile playstyle and can adapt to any situation.\nThe Ranged Build The Ranged Build is perfect for those who don’t want to get caught in the heat of battle. With this build, you can unleash a barrage of projectiles on your foes while keeping your distance. This build primarily focuses on dexterity and agility stats, increasing the accuracy and critical damage of ranged weaponry.\nThe Dual-Wield Build The Dual-Wield Build is perfect for players who want to be nimble and fast while also dealing massive damage. The build focuses on the speed and agility stats, allowing you to strike enemies quickly and efficiently with dual-wielded weapons. This build is perfect for taking out enemies quickly and mitigating incoming attacks with ease.\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring offers gamers an incredible array of character-building options that can be tailored to your preferred style of play. Whether you prefer close-range combat, magic-based attacks, or long-range weapons, the game has something for everyone. The five builds we have listed here are just a few examples of the many options available to you. So, pick your build, fine-tune your stats, and embark on the journey to become the ultimate warrior in Elden Ring.\nHaving the best Warrior build will go a long way in Elden Ring. Warrior is one of the most fun classes for beginners and veterans alike. It is also recommended for new players thanks to the speed of this class yet having the ability to tank some attacks. But just starting with Warrior won’t ensure you have fun throughout, especially if you use the wrong builds. So in this guide let us learn the list of best Warrior class builds in Elden Ring, also learn about the best Early Build in the game.\nBest Warrior Build in Elden Ring Weapons Grafted Blade Greatsword Stormhawk Axe Crepus’s Black-Key Crossbow Scavenger’s Curved Sword Reduvia Dagger Shields Hawk Crest Wooden Shield Flame Crest Wooden Shield Horse Crest Wooden Shield Armor Sets Carian Knight Set (combined weight is 23.5) Godrick Knight Set (combined weight is 28.1) Twinned Set (combined weight is 30) The focus here is heavily on the weight (pun intended!) because your character should be light and fast. The above weapon recommendations are slightly on the heavier side. But you easily compensate for them with light shields and armors. So not only are you agile but also can deal some decent heavy damage. In case you do end up getting hit then because of the above builds you will take some damage and not die instantly.\nGrafted Blade Greatsword\nStormhawk Axe\nCrepus’s Black-Key Crossbow\nScavenger’s Curved Sword\nReduvia Dagger\nHawk Crest Wooden Shield\nFlame Crest Wooden Shield\nHorse Crest Wooden Shield\nCarian Knight Set (combined weight is 23.5)\nGodrick Knight Set (combined weight is 28.1)\nTwinned Set (combined weight is 30)\nAttributes to upgrade\nVigor\nEndurance\nStrength\nDexterity\nFrom the above four stats, focus more of your upgrades on Endurance and Dexterity to increase your Stamina and ability to use advanced weapons. But don’t leave the other two attributes unupgraded as having a decent amount of strength and HP is equally important.\nVigor Endurance Strength Dexterity The Best Warrior Class Build for Early Game Weapons Battle Axe Claymore Reduvia Dagger Shields: Heater Shield (weighs 3.5) Armor: Chain Set (combined weight is 21) Coif Armor Gauntlets Leggings So to explain the above build. Starting with the weapons, Battle Axe and Claymore do excellent damage and can also be wielded by Warrior easily. You just need to increase your strength attribute a bit in order to use them effectively. But this is will come in handy as it will increase the damage. In case you choose to use Reduvia then avoid using Shield and dual wield both the daggers.\nBattle Axe\nClaymore\nReduvia Dagger\nCoif\nArmor\nGauntlets\nLeggings\nFor the shield, Heater Shield is one of the best shields in the early game. You can easily block the physical attacks of bosses like Margit and Godrick. While this shield doesn’t block magic attacks that well it should have you covered with most physical attacks.\nLastly, the Chain set armor weighs only slightly heavier than your default starting set. But this armor gives some excellent defense to physical attacks. As for the recommended attribute upgrades, those are the same as mentioned above in the best build section.\nThat sums up this guide on the best Warrior class builds list in Elden Ring, also learn the best early game build. You should also check our guides on the Best Builds list for Different classes, and the best starting classes if you want to try another class.\n","wordCount":"1105","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Taylor"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/list-of-best-warrior-builds-to-use-in-elden-ring-1432261/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unleash Your Inner Warrior: The Ultimate List of Elden Ring Builds To Dominate the Battlefields!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 9, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1105 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;William Taylor</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-melee-tank-build>The Melee Tank Build</a></li><li><a href=#the-magic-rogue-build>The Magic Rogue Build</a></li><li><a href=#the-balanced-build>The Balanced Build</a></li><li><a href=#the-ranged-build>The Ranged Build</a></li><li><a href=#the-dual-wield-build>The Dual-Wield Build</a></li><li><a href=#best-warrior-build-in-elden-ring>Best Warrior Build in Elden Ring</a><ul><li><a href=#the-best-warrior-class-build-for-early-game>The Best Warrior Class Build for Early Game</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unleash-your-inner-warrior-the-ultimate-list-of-elden-ring-builds-to-dominate-the-battlefields>Unleash Your Inner Warrior: The Ultimate List of Elden Ring Builds To Dominate the Battlefields!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unleash-your-inner-warrior-the-ultimate-list-of-elden-ring-builds-to-dominate-the-battlefields>#</a></h1><p>If you are a fan of RPG games, then you must have heard of Elden Ring, the upcoming action-packed RPG game from FromSoftware.
