# You Won't Believe These 5 Easy Tips to Fix Your Belt Tensioner Assembly – Save Hundreds on Repairs Today!

A belt tensioner assembly is an essential component of the engine. It helps keep the belt tight and ensures that it runs smoothly through the pulleys. A malfunctioning belt tensioner assembly can lead to wearing out of the belt or even worse, damaging other components of the engine.

Fortunately, fixing a belt tensioner assembly doesn't necessarily require a mechanic's expertise. The following 5 easy tips can help you fix your belt tensioner assembly and save hundreds of dollars in repairs.

## Tip 1: Check for Visible Damage

The first step in fixing a belt tensioner assembly is to inspect it for any visible damage. Check for any cracks, wear, or broken parts. If you notice any of these signs, it's time to replace the assembly.

A loose or worn belt tensioner assembly will cause the belt to slip or squeal, and should be fixed as soon as possible.

## Tip 2: Determine the Belt Tensioner Assembly's Type

After checking for visible damage, it's essential to determine the belt tensioner assembly's type. There are two types of belt tensioner assemblies: Automatic and manual.

An automatic belt tensioner assembly will automatically adjust the belt's tension while a manual assembly requires manual tensioning. Ensure that you get the correct type of assembly before replacing it.

## Tip 3: Remove the Old Assembly

Once you've identified the type of belt tensioner assembly, it's time to remove the old one. Start by using a wrench or socket to remove the bolts holding the assembly in place. Once the bolts are removed, take the old assembly off and replace it with the new one.

## Tip 4: Properly Tension the Belt

After fixing the new belt tensioner assembly in place, it's time to adjust the belt's tension. The amount of tension required for the belt will depend on the type of engine you have.

Consult the engine's manual or a qualified mechanic to determine the correct tension. Too little tension in the belt will cause it to slip while too much pressure will damage the belt and other components.

## Tip 5: Test the Engine

The last step is to test the engine to ensure the new belt tensioner assembly is working correctly. Start the engine and listen for any squealing or unusual noises.

Check the belt for any fraying or slipping. If everything works correctly, congratulations, you've successfully fixed the belt tensioner assembly.

In conclusion, fixing a belt tensioner assembly doesn't have to be costly. By following these five easy tips, you can fix it yourself and save hundreds of dollars in repairs. Remember to check and replace worn or damaged assemblies promptly, adjust the belt's tension properly, and test the engine before driving your vehicle.

I wasn’t paid to write these guides. Ben asked me to do it as a favor to him. Considering all that he’s done for our community I felt it was the least I could do. To be honest even though it took about 2 months to build and document, I had a lot of fun doing it. It forced me to write guides in a manner that was easy for everyone to understand and cleanup my Github so I could share any files that were used that aren’t part of the original download. You’re not obligated but if you would like, feel free to donate.
