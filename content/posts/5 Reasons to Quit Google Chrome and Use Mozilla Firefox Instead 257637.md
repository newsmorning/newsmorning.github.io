Say Goodbye To Chrome: Discover The Shocking 5 Reasons Why Firefox Is The Superior Browser!

For years, Google Chrome has dominated the browser market. Its speed, ease of use, and customization options have kept users loyal. However, there's a new browser in town that's giving Google a run for its money - Firefox. Firefox has become the browser of choice for many users. In this article, we'll discuss the 5 reasons why Firefox is the superior browser.

1. It's faster

One of the most significant advantages of Firefox over Google Chrome is its speed. Firefox has undergone major improvements in recent years, and it's now faster than ever before. It's been tested and proven to be faster than Chrome in certain aspects, such as page loading and opening new tabs.

2. It's more secure

Another major advantage of using Firefox is the high level of security it provides. Firefox is known for its private browsing features and phishing protection, which is superior to Chrome's. The Mozilla Foundation, which is responsible for Firefox, constantly works to improve the browser's security features to protect its users and their data from any potential threats.

3. It's open-source

Firefox is an open-source browser, which means that it's free to use, and its source code is available to the public. This allows developers to collaborate and make improvements to the browser, which results in a more stable and efficient browser. Additionally, it's not dependent on any specific operating system, so it can be used on any device, regardless of the operating system.

4. It's customizable

Firefox has a wide range of customizable features that allow users to personalize their browsing experience. Firefox's add-ons are highly customizable and can improve productivity, provide additional security features, or even change the design of the browser. These features are not available in Chrome, making Firefox the more versatile browser.

5. It's privacy-friendly

Firefox is built with privacy in mind. It's no secret that Chrome tracks users' browsing data to provide targeted advertising. In contrast, Firefox has introduced new features that prevent tracking to protect its users' privacy. These features include the use of encryption technology and the ability to block third-party cookies.

Conclusion

Firefox has proven to be an excellent browser, superior to Chrome in many ways. From its speed to its security features, Firefox has become a popular choice for those looking for a more private and customizable browsing experience. If you're looking for a reliable, feature-rich browser that puts your privacy first, it's time to say goodbye to Chrome and make the switch to Firefox.

When Chrome is so far the most used browser on the internet, it’s far from being the best. Firefox from Mozilla is one such option to consider for your daily use. Compared to Chrome, Firefox has additional built-in features and is more focused on privacy. And unlike other Chrome competitors, it’s one of the few browsers that isn’t built on the Chromium web engine.
 
Read along as I give you the top five solid reasons why you should quit Chrome and adopt Firefox as your daily browser.
 
## 1. AutoPlay Blocking on Websites
 
An annoyance for many people using Chrome is the auto-playing videos on the websites they visit. On some of those sites, the videos will pop up no matter where you are on that page until you close it out. On Chrome, you can install third-party plugins to block those annoying auto-play videos, or better yet, use Firefox, which has the inbuilt feature. 
 
To block autoplay on videos using Firefox, 
 
- Step 1: Click on the hamburger icon in the top right-hand corner and select Settings. Step 2: Select Privacy & Security, scroll down to “Permissions” and choose “Settings” on Autoplay to Block both Audio and Videos on Every Website. By default, the settings block out all audio.

 
## 2. Better Privacy
 
No one will ever say with a straight face that Chrome is great for privacy. The whole business model is based on gathering your private data so that they can tailor-make ads. Firefox, on the other hand, blocks third-party cookies and trackers by default. It also blocks fingerprinting, which tracks and collects information about your device or PC hardware, software, add-ons, fonts installed, web browsers, and preferences. Firefox has rolled out a “Total Cookie Protection” feature which blocks tracking companies from following you around from site to site, keeping those cookies only for those websites for which they were created, reducing the data they have on you.
 
Total Cookie protection is active by default as the preferred browser privacy settings. To customize Firefox browser privacy settings,
 
- Step 1: Click on the hamburger icon in the top right-hand corner and select Settings. Step 2: Select Privacy & Security, on the first option of “Browser Privacy“. You can choose to customize your preferences on the types of cookies to track and use the “Standard” settings or “Strict” option Firefox offers.

 
## 3. FireFox Has Unique Extensions
 
Speaking of extensions, Chrome does offer you more than Firefox. But the ones you will use onChrome, they are also available on Firefox. The two unique extensions I found useful on Firefoxthat isn’t available on Chrome are “Firefox Relay“ and “Firefox Multi-Account Containers“. 
 
The multi-accounts containers allow you to log into multiple accounts on separate tabs withinthe browser. Like more than one social media account. Firefox relays give you temporary emailswith alias that can be forwarded to your real email address and you use them to signup fornewsletters or when you don’t feel like giving out your real email address.

## 4. Firefox is Open Source
 
While Chrome is built on the open source Chromium web engine, the browser itself isn’t opensource making it difficult for independent activists to inspect the code. On the other hand,Firefox is 100% open source and supported by a community of a thousand developers.
 
## 5. Mobile Extension
 
Have you wished that the mobile chrome app had extensions and support like the web browser? Well, keep on wishing, probably it’ll never happen. 
 
With the Firefox mobile app for Andriod, you can now add extensions to make the browsing experience more enjoyable. To add extensions to Firefox mobile app, tap on the breadcrumb hamburger in the bottom left corner and select “Add Ons”.
 
And that’s it for our list of top 5 reasons why we think Mozilla Firefox is better, ultimately, your choice of browser is up to you. Are you ready to make the switch? Share with us in the comment section.
