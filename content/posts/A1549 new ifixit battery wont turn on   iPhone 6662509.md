# You Won't Believe What Happens When You Install The Latest iFixit Battery On Your iPhone 6 A1549 - It Refuses To Turn On!

If you own an iPhone 6 A1549 and you've recently replaced its battery with an iFixit one, you might be surprised to find that your phone won't turn on. You're not alone. Many iPhone users have experienced this issue too.

The problem is caused by a security feature called the "Gas Gauge", which is built into the battery. The Gas Gauge communicates with the iPhone's operating system and tells it how much power is left in the battery. When you install a new battery, the Gas Gauge needs to be reset, or else the iPhone won't recognize the new battery.

To reset the Gas Gauge, you need to use a tool called a "battery analyzer" or take it to an Apple Store. The analyzer will charge and discharge the battery, then reset the Gas Gauge. Alternatively, you can use a tool like iBackupBot to reset the Gas Gauge parameters.

If you've installed the iFixit battery correctly and are confident that it's not a problem with your phone or installation, then resetting the Gas Gauge should fix the issue. However, resetting is easier said than done.

The process is quite complicated and requires some expertise, so it's not recommended for the average user. In fact, Apple does not recommend that users attempt to replace their own iPhone battery due to the complexities involved.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing issues with your iPhone 6 A1549 after replacing its battery with an iFixit one, it's most likely caused by a Gas Gauge issue. To fix it, you need to reset the Gas Gauge parameters using a battery analyzer or software like iBackupBot. If you're not comfortable doing it yourself, it's best to take it to an Apple Store or a professional repair shop. Remember, replacing a battery can be a tricky process, so always proceed with caution.

## Chosen Solution
 Ok so I have this iPhone 6 A1549. The OEM battery is completely shot. I took out the old battery and put in a brand new iFixIt battery in. I made sure all the screws went in the exact same place they were and now the phone doesn’t turn on. I inspected the cables and connectors and they are not damaged (screen and battery). If I plug in the phone it turns on, Apple logo then black screen with backlight on. Try to DFU restore it and I get error 4005. Did this multiple times. Decided to unplug the new battery and plug back in the old one. The DFU restore was successful but the phone won’t boot because the battery is shot. Swapped the batteries again and it won’t turn on. I’m assuming it’s a bad battery from iFixIt. Any ideas? With the old battery plugged in if I try to turn it on I just get the dead battery plug it in screen. I plug it in and it shows it’s plugged and the battery is dead and won’t charge. New battery plugged in and it doesn’t turn on at all unless it’s plugged in to wall outlet and it just turns on logo black screen logo black screen logo and so on. Should I just order a new battery?
