The Secret Trick to Revive Your Dead LG X Power Battery - No Replacement Required!

Are you tired of constantly having to charge your LG X Power phone? Do you feel like your phone's battery has died for good? Well, there's actually a secret trick that could potentially revive your dead LG X Power battery, saving you both time and money!

First, let's discuss why your phone's battery dies. Over time, the lithium-ion battery in your LG X Power will begin to lose its capacity to hold a charge, causing it to drain more quickly than usual. This is a normal process that happens to most phone batteries over time. However, if you've noticed that your phone's battery is draining significantly faster than before, it might be time for a replacement.

But before you purchase a new battery or replace your phone altogether, try this secret trick: discharging and recharging your phone's battery.

To do this, completely drain your phone's battery until it turns off on its own. Then, charge the phone to 100% without turning it on. Once it's fully charged, unplug the phone and turn it on. Use the phone normally until the battery completely drains again. Repeat this process at least two more times, and you should see a noticeable improvement in your phone's battery life.

How does this work? Lithium-ion batteries have something called a "memory effect." This means that the battery "remembers" how much energy it was last given, and will only charge to that same amount in the future. By fully discharging and recharging your phone's battery multiple times, you "reset" the memory effect, allowing your battery to charge to its full potential once again.

It's important to note that this trick won't revive every dead battery. If your battery is completely dead and won't even charge at all, a replacement might be necessary. Additionally, constantly draining your battery to zero and recharging it to 100% can actually shorten its lifespan over time. It's best to only do this trick once or twice a month to maintain your battery's health.

In conclusion, there might be a simple solution to your phone's battery problems. Before spending money on a new battery or phone, try discharging and recharging your LG X Power's battery to reset its memory effect. With this secret trick, you might be able to revive your dead battery and extend your phone's lifespan.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I know the LG X POWER is considered to have a non removable battery.
However, I'm hardware hacking type guy and I was wondering if anyone has had any success with attempting this, and if so how?
Thanks,
Robert

 This will get you to the battery.

 Hello! Definitley do-able. You just need to remove the back battery cover, remove a few screws, and you'll have access to the battery. Then you disconnect it, and replace with a new one.
Batteries can be purchased online through ebay, and there are tutorials online showing you how to properly dissasemble it.
