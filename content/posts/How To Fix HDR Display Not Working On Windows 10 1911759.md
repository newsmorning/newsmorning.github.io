Boost Your Display Quality with This Easy Fix for HDR not Working on Windows 10!

If you have a Windows 10 PC and an HDR-capable display, you may have tried to enable HDR but noticed that it wasn't working properly. HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is a display technology capable of producing a wider range of colors and brightness levels than traditional displays. However, if you're experiencing issues with HDR on your Windows 10 PC, don't worry – there's an easy fix that you can try.

Step 1: Confirm that your display is HDR-capable

Before you start troubleshooting, it's essential to confirm that your display is HDR-capable. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Display settings on your Windows 10 PC.

2. Scroll down and click on "Advanced display settings."

3. Scroll down again and click on "Display adapter properties."

4. Click on the "Monitor" tab.

5. Look for an option called "HDR" under the "Capabilities" section.

If this option is present, your display is HDR-capable. If not, HDR is not supported by your display, and there's nothing you can do to fix it.

Step 2: Check your display settings

The next step is to confirm that HDR is enabled on your display. Here's how:

1. Open the Display settings on your Windows 10 PC.

2. Scroll down and click on "Windows HD Color settings."

3. Toggle on "HDR and WCG" if it's not already turned on.

4. Scroll down and check if "Play HDR games and apps" is enabled. If not, toggle it on.

Step 3: Update your display drivers

If your display is HDR-capable and HDR is turned on in your display settings, but you're still experiencing issues, then it's time to update your display drivers. Here's how:

1. Open the Device Manager.

2. Expand the "Display adapters" category.

3. Right-click on your display adapter and click on "Update driver."

4. Select "Search automatically for updated driver software" and follow the on-screen instructions.

Step 4: Check your HDMI cable

If your display sometimes works with HDR but not at other times, the issue could be with the HDMI cable you're using. Try swapping out the cable and see if that fixes the issue. Be sure to use an HDMI 2.0 or higher cable, as HDR requires a higher bandwidth than standard displays.

Step 5: Turn off Game Mode

Finally, if none of the previous steps worked, it's possible that Game Mode is interfering with HDR on your PC. Here's how to disable it:

1. Open the Settings app on your Windows 10 PC.

2. Click on "Gaming."

3. Toggle the switch under "Game Mode" to "Off."

In conclusion, if you're experiencing issues with HDR on your Windows 10 PC, there are several steps you can take to fix the problem. Confirm that your display is HDR-capable, check your display settings, update your display drivers, check your HDMI cable, and turn off Game Mode. With a little bit of troubleshooting, you'll be able to enjoy HDR and take full advantage of your display's capabilities.
