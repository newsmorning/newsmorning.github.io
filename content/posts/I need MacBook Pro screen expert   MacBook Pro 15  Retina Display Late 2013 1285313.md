This Mind-Blowing Macbook Pro Screen Hack Will Make You Say WOW!

The latest MacBook Pro has been lauded as one of the most incredible machines ever made, due in large part to its impressive Retina display. However, one tech enthusiast decided to take things to the next level by implementing a mind-blowing screen hack that will leave you stunned.

The hack, which involves a bit of computer wizardry and a steady hand, allows the user to essentially turn their MacBook Pro into a touchscreen device. Now, before you start thinking this is some elaborate DIY project involving a drill and a ton of risk, rest assured that it's much more straightforward than that.

The trick involves the use of a transparent capacitive sheet that is placed over the MacBook Pro's display. This sheet is then connected to an external circuit board and plugged into the computer via USB. Once installed, the user can interact with the MacBook Pro's interface using their finger just as they would with a standard touchscreen device.

This hack is truly impressive not only because it provides a more tactile way to use the MacBook Pro, but also because of the sheer amount of work that went into it. The transparent sheet used for the screen is incredibly durable and can withstand a tremendous amount of pressure without breaking.

Moreover, the individual who created the hack was able to carefully position the circuit board so that it would not interfere with the MacBook Pro's internal components or cause any permanent damage to the device.

While it's important to note that this hack is not endorsed by Apple and can actually void your warranty if implemented incorrectly, it's undeniable that it is a truly awe-inspiring feat of engineering. It's also a testament to the ingenuity of tech enthusiasts who are always looking for new and exciting ways to push the boundaries of what we think is possible.

In the end, this mind-blowing MacBook Pro screen hack will leave you saying wow for all the right reasons. It's a testament to the power of technology and the incredible things that can be achieved with a bit of creativity and a willingness to take risks.

So, if you're feeling adventurous and want to try out this hack for yourself, remember to always proceed with caution and be mindful of the potential risks involved. But if you're able to pull it off, you'll be rewarded with a truly one-of-a-kind computing experience that will leave you feeling like a tech genius.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, Ifixit community!
I'll tell you my whole story hopefully, some experts give me some solutions
I have a late 2013 15inch  MacBook pro with Nvidia graphics
one of the days I opened it and notice a pink spot on the screen :(
This pink spot only appears in dark/black areas. In white areas, it doesn't appear
I've reset the SMC/PRAM and the problem is still persistsI've factory reset the MacBook and still persistsI downloaded a software called gfxCardStatus to change between IG/DG and the problem still persistsI plugged the MacBook with second monitor via HDMI and the pink spot doesn't appear in the second monitorI tried some website solution like jscreenfix website and youtube stuck pixel fix video
Finally, I tried some remedies like pressure on the screen with a pen covered with a soft towel, heat and pressure with a hairdryer and seems like this pink spot won't go away.
Some people told me it is a screen defect and you need to replace the entire screen, and as you know the screen is a little bit pricey and I really love "DIY" and fix everything myself.
So please, could some screen experts explain why this issue happened to the screen?
From the display cableLCD panel its selfThe defusion  sheets behind the LCD panelThe screen controller board
Is the issue from one of the above?
There’s a lot of cheap cracked screens on eBay, I could purchase one and take some part  it and fix my own screen?

 No, your LCD display its self is not the issue! A pink spot like this one is a noise issue as the dot pattern with it tells us the signal is bad Vs the LCD its self.
Now to confuse you! While I stated the issue was not the LCD its self, there’s more inside the display assembly than a simple LCD panel! There is a small logic board (T-CON) which holds logic to send the needed signal to the LCD so the given row and column receive the signal to create the image you see. This same board also converts the data signal coming from the main logic board through the cable from it. This connection is called eDP (iDP).

You might have caused this with your cleaning! I often see this kind of damage from people who spray their screens with a cleaner and then wipe it down. What happens is the cleaner drips to the bottom wetting the T-CON board and over time the buildup of cleaner corrodes the logic board and its connections.
Sadly, while I’ve saved a few most of the time I have also needed to replace the display on many. I’ll worn you this isn’t an easy screen to take apart to even get to the T-CON board to try to save it or getting a good LCD panel is not easy as they are fragile. I often just replace the full assembly as its just easier.

 I think you need to replace the entier display.
