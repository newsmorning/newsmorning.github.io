Have you ever dropped your phone and shattered the screen? It's a frustrating experience, but thankfully it's a problem that can be easily solved by replacing the damaged screen. That's what I did when I accidentally dropped my iPhone 5S, but what happened next was truly unexpected.

I took my phone to a local repair shop and had the screen replaced. At first, everything seemed to be working just fine. The new screen was clear and responsive, and all the apps and features appeared to be working as they should.

However, a few hours later, I noticed that my phone was overheating. It was hot to the touch, and the battery was draining much faster than usual. I quickly realized that something was wrong.

I did some research online and discovered that this was a common issue for iPhone users who had replaced their screens. Apparently, when you replace the screen on an iPhone, the device can no longer recognize the fingerprint sensor, which can cause the phone to overheat and drain the battery.

The solution? I had to reset the phone to its factory settings and re-enter all of my information and settings manually. This was a time-consuming and frustrating process, but it worked. Once I had reset the phone, the overheating stopped and the battery life returned to normal.

So, if you're planning on replacing the screen on your iPhone, be prepared for the possibility of unexpected consequences. Make sure you research the process thoroughly and follow all of the instructions carefully. And, most importantly, be patient. It may take some time to get your phone back to its former state, but it's worth it to have a fully functional device.

## Chosen Solution
 my iphone 5s had some problems where the screen wasnt responding at all parts of the screen and when i was typing it sometimes clicked at random places on the screen. so i changed it though i still have the same problems. what can i do to fix this?

 In most cases, a screen ghost touching or clicking by itself is due to bad screen.
On the other had, screen not responding to touch can be either bad screen  or failed logic board.
To narrow down the issue to either/or, you should try and find a known good screen. Not necessarily new since new screens can be defective out of the box (or you can damage them while installing them).
For example, try your two screens on a known working device to make sure they are ok, and/or try your own device with a screen known to be working fine on another device.

If you still get touch failure with a known good screen, then the touch circuit on your iPhone 5S has failed it is not uncommon. We've fixed our share of those, and they are usually pretty straightforward if the technician is experienced with them. 
BUT, the iPhone 5S board repair may not be economical if you compare cost of repairing the board vs. cost of purchasing a used device in a working condition. So consider that as well.
