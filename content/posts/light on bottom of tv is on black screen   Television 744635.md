Title: The Shocking Revelation When My TV's Bottom Light Turned On 

Subtitle: The Unbelievable Experience that Paralyzed Me in Awe

Introduction:

A few nights ago, something strange happened to me. I was watching my favorite show on TV, and suddenly, the bottom light turned on, and my screen went black. At first, I thought it was just a minor technical issue that I could quickly fix. However, I was in for a surprise. What I discovered would leave me in disbelief and paralyzed in awe. This is the story of the shocking revelation when my TV's bottom light turned on.

Body:

It all began with a typical night watching my favorite show. Suddenly, the bottom light of my TV turned on while the screen went black. I thought maybe one of the connections had loosened, so I tried unplugging and plugging it back in. No luck. I then tried restarting the TV, but it was still black. Frustrated, I was about to give up when something odd caught my attention.

The light was faint, but it was there. I could hardly believe my eyes. The light was reflecting something. But what? I moved closer to the TV and saw that it was reflecting something indistinct in the dark.

At first, I saw a blurry image, but as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, the image became clearer. It was an image of a man, and he was looking back at me. I was frozen with fear; I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

Suddenly, the man's face changed, and he started speaking to me, but I could barely hear what he was saying. It sounded like he was speaking from another dimension. He repeated my name several times, and it was as if he was trying to make contact with me.

I stumbled back from the TV, and as I did, the image of the man disappeared. The light on the TV went off, and the screen returned, and I could continue watching my show. I was unbelievably overwhelmed by what had happened. 

What did it all mean? What was the message that the mysterious man had for me? 

Conclusion:

The encounter with the mysterious man on my TV is something I'll never forget. It's hard to explain, but it was such a surreal experience that I still find hard to comprehend. Although I may never know the full meaning of what happened, I do believe that it was a sign of something more significant. It makes me question whether there could be an alternate dimension or reality beyond our own. Sometimes, it's the unexplained things that leave the most significant impact on us. The shocking revelation when my TV's bottom light turned on will always be one of them.

## Chosen Solution
 Yes light on bottom of tv is on black screen

 @bady0522 what is the exact make and model for your TV? It sounds like you are saying that your power LED is on but you have a black screen. You are not telling us if you have sound.
If you do have sound then, in a darkened room, turn the TV on to a channel where you have sound etc. Then use a flashlight and shine it at an angle against the screen see if you can make out shapes silhouettes etc. If so you know that your backlight is not working. This may require replacing the LCD strips inside the panel or a new power board. You will have to remove the back from your TV and check the power board with a multimeter Post some good images of all of your boards with your question so we an see what you see. Adding images to an existing question
If you cannot see anything (triple check) then it is possible that this is a bad main board or a bad t-con board as well as the panel (unlikely but possible)
