# SHOCKING! PlayStation 4 Struck by Lightning - Watch the Unbelievable Rebuild Process!

It was supposed to be an ordinary day for John, an avid gamer, who just wanted to unwind after a long day at work. He sat down in front of his beloved PlayStation 4, ready to immerse himself in his favorite game, but little did he know that fate had different plans.

Suddenly, a loud boom shook the house, and a bright flash of light illuminated the room. John's PS4 was struck by lightning! The console was dead, leaving John heartbroken and frustrated. He had invested a lot of money into his gaming setup, and he couldn't bear to lose it all.

However, John refused to give up on his beloved console. He took it to a reputable repair shop, where the technicians assessed the damage. To his relief, they suggested they could rebuild the PS4 instead of replacing it, which would save him a significant amount of money.

The rebuild process was nothing short of miraculous. The technicians disassembled the entire console, carefully removing each component piece by piece. They then inspected each part individually, looking for any signs of damage. They cleaned the motherboard and reattached the working components, eventually reassembling it into a fully functioning console.

But the real magic happened when they powered it on. The console lit up, and the iconic blue light shone once again, much to John's amazement. He couldn't believe his eyes. His PlayStation 4, which was once dead, had been brought back to life!

The rebuild process was not only a testament to the technicians' skills, but also to the importance of investing in quality equipment. John's PS4 was designed to withstand such an impact, and though it suffered some damage, it was able to be rebuilt.

John's story is a cautionary tale for all of us, reminding us to take precautions against lightning and power surges by investing in surge protectors and quality equipment. But it's also a story of hope and resilience, reminding us that even when faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, there is always a way to rebuild and come back stronger.

In the end, John was able to continue enjoying his favorite games on his rebuilt console, and he was grateful for the technicians who made it all possible. John's PS4 may have been struck by lightning, but it was the rebuild process that truly shocked him.

## Chosen Solution
 My house got hit by lightning and ran through the Ethernet cable to my  PS4 and fried it. Is their any way I can rebuild it or should I cut my loses and get a whole new system?

 I wouldn’t advice working on it yourself. I doubt you know which parts got damaged, and even if you fix that, there might be more broken. I’d suggest looking for a new one.
