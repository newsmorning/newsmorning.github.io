Mobile gaming has exploded in popularity in recent years, with more and more people turning to their smartphones for their gaming fix. In response to this trend, gaming hardware company Razer released the Razer Phone, marketed as the ultimate gaming device. But is it really? We tested the phone to find out.

First impressions of the Razer Phone are impressive. The device has a sleek, black design and a large, 5.7-inch screen with a resolution of 2560x1440. The screen features a 120Hz refresh rate, much higher than most other smartphones on the market. This makes for a smoother and more responsive gaming experience, with less motion blur and better image quality.

Under the hood, the Razer Phone packs a powerful Snapdragon 835 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 4000mAh battery. This combination means that the phone can handle even the most demanding games with ease, providing fast load times, smooth gameplay and long battery life.

The phone also has a number of features designed specifically for gaming. The Game Booster app allows users to optimize their gaming settings for maximum performance, while the Razer Cortex app provides a range of performance-enhancing tools. The phone also has a front-facing stereo speaker system with Dolby Atmos technology, providing crisp, clear sound.

However, despite all of these impressive features, we found that the Razer Phone is not quite the ultimate gaming device. One major issue we encountered was the lack of in-game haptic feedback. This means that gamers don't get the satisfying vibrations and feedback that they might expect from a console or PC gaming experience.

Another issue was the design of the phone itself. While it looks sleek and stylish, it can be difficult to hold during long gaming sessions due to its flat design and sharp edges. Additionally, the lack of a headphone jack may be a dealbreaker for some gamers who prefer to use wired headphones for better sound quality.

Overall, the Razer Phone is a solid choice for mobile gamers who value high performance and responsiveness. Its powerful hardware, impressive screen and gaming-specific features make it a top contender in the smartphone gaming market. However, it falls short of being the ultimate gaming device due to its lack of haptic feedback and certain design choices. Ultimately, the best gaming device is one that meets the individual needs and preferences of the gamer.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello I have a question about the games, when I download games on the PC gives me the  Minimum Requirements to run the game, Why not do so for games on phones ?

 Hi Amr,
It does. If you scroll down to the additional information section in google play store it will tell you the size of the game and the minimum version of Android required for the game to work. E.g. Android 4.1 and up.
