Unbelievable! Know the Secret to Fix Overheating Resistors in Onkyo Tx525Sv Home Audio Receiver with This One Simple Trick!

Are you tired of dealing with a receiver that constantly overheats and shuts down? Do you own an Onkyo Tx525Sv home audio receiver and are looking for a solution? Look no further, because we have discovered a secret trick to fix overheating resistors in your Onkyo receiver that is simple and can be done in just a few steps.

Before we dive into the solution, let's first understand why resistors overheat. A resistor is a component that resists the flow of electrical current. The power that passes through the resistor generates heat, causing the component to heat up. If a resistor overheats, it can become damaged or even break down entirely. Overheated resistors can also cause other components to fail, leading to further problems. In an Onkyo Tx525Sv home audio receiver, overheating resistors are a common issue that can cause the system to shut down, leaving the user frustrated.

The secret trick to fixing overheating resistors in your Onkyo Tx525Sv home audio receiver is a simple one – all you need to do is replace the resistors with higher power rated ones. The rated power of a resistor refers to the maximum power it can safely dissipate without overheating.

Here are the steps to follow:

Step 1: Identify the overheating resistors.

Identifying the overheating resistors is the first step in solving the issue. You can identify the resistors that are getting too hot by touching them or using a thermometer to measure their temperature. The resistors that are running excessively hot will be the ones that need replacing.

Step 2: Determine the power rating of the resistors.

You can determine the power rating of the resistors by looking at the markings on the component or referring to the service manual. The power rating will be expressed in watts.

Step 3: Choose higher power rated resistors.

Once you have identified the overheating resistors and determined their power rating, you need to choose higher power rated resistors. For example, if the original resistor has a power rating of 5 watts, you can replace it with a 7-watt or 10-watt resistor that can handle more power and dissipate the heat more effectively.

Step 4: Replace the overheating resistors.

Using a soldering iron, carefully remove the old resistors from the circuit board and replace them with the new, higher power rated ones. Make sure to follow the polarity and placement of the resistors as per the service manual.

Step 5: Test the receiver.

Once you have replaced the resistors, turn on the receiver and test it to see if it still overheats or shuts down. If the issue persists, you may need to repeat the process with other resistors that are overheating.

In conclusion, overheating resistors in an Onkyo Tx525Sv home audio receiver can be a frustrating issue, but with this simple trick, you can fix the problem yourself. By replacing the overheating resistors with higher power rated ones, you can improve the efficiency of your receiver and prevent future breakdowns. However, if you are unsure about performing this procedure, it’s best to seek assistance from a qualified technician.


## Chosen Solution
 This has several resistors and an area about the size of a quarter  that is looking a burnt brown on the pcb near the front of the unit.  There are about 5 or 6 ringed resistors total in this area. Tested and results below. When using the tuner/radio  portion all seems to be fine (uses the bypass mode for radio). When  using the bypass feature (which only utilizes the 2 rear channels I  believe) for the video/theater audio, this works too. The option to use  anything that utilizes the DSP portion is a intermittent. Just a low  hum or his is presenting thru speakers sometimes. Shame to toss this in the trash  because this receiver is an oldy but goody. Seems like I could replace a  few resistors and all would be well? Hopefully the community here will  be familiar with the issue. Thanks in advance! I have located a service  manual but lack the knowlege to read it (link below). I also have pics of the  overheated resistor location.

Actual  board part number (I think) is ncar-5121. These are numbers from the  board anyway.
I've  resoldered all of those resistor and transistor contact points plus  re-soldered all the contacts on about 1/3 of this board. I was able to get my magnifying headset on and locate a few bad / cracked solder points as well in other areas. Improvement  has been noticed as not all of the resistors listed below are as hot as  they were with the exception of the 3 listed below.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/m66gysdhfqyojz...
Svc manual https://www.dropbox.com/s/9sjwtrqncm77du...
The resistors and their tested values ​​are:  r930 = 118.8 ohm HOT TO TOUCH!  r929 = 118.5 ohm HOT TO TOUCH!  r928 = 18.4 ohm HOT TO TOUCH!  r935 = 22.1 ohm  r923 = 1.5 ohm  r925 = 11.4 ohm  r926 = 11.5 ohm  These seem to be within range?
Values  ​​for outputs for these voltage regulators tested by touching the negative to the G (?) Terminal and  pos to the O terminal (is this the correct way to test?):  Q921 = + 11.7v  q922 = -11.6v  q923 = + 6.02v  q924 = - 5.8v then drops to 0 usually (this one drops voltage after heating up)  q925 = + 5.5v
I am currently at a standstill and need help with schematic. I specifically need help with the next troubleshooting step. The service manual is provided and I believe the resistors and regulators in question are on page 36.
If components need replaced could you provide suggestions on comparable replacements if needed? Where to get? Thanks. I've been studying on how to test these voltage regulators as well. To repeat - I do not know how to read schematics. I wouldn't have gotten this far without help. It  took a bit of hard study to be able to read that schematic and still  don't understand much but am able to limp thru so far :) I look forward  to the next step :)

Hi Edward,
My experience with old electronics is that capacitors deteriorate with age. Look for bulges on the top and leaking brown  goo.  I fixed a NAD amplifier and a Technics turntable by doing this.
Here is a link for the service manual for your receiver which should help:

HiFi Engine is a very good site for old electronics.  You may already know this but it may help others reading this.

 @longoverdue we would need to know what regulator your Onkyo is using. If it has a thermal shutdown, then yes it will. Most voltage regulators do not have a thermal shutdown so if you get into a thermal runaway which exceed the maximum temperature your voltage regulator will usually go up in a puff of smoke. Going by your data I would replace the regulator and install a heatsink for it. Go with something like a NJM79M06 which looks like it was used on your board anyway and according to your schematics should fit. See what that will give you. Get the data sheet and the part if needed from here
