## Chosen Solution
 I have a cyberpowerpc laptop that recently begun shutting down whenever I use high power usage. The orange flashing indicator is now consistently on even after replacing battery and power cable twice. I reinstalled a fresh copy of windows and I also have been receiving a kernel power event 41 63. I can use laptop for anything not demanding like gaming. I disassembled the laptop and checked incoming voltages to motherboard and tested plugs. Battery reads 100% most the time and discharges normally when not plugged in. I am trying to pinpoint the problem to fix im thinking my video card is shot or motherboard. I can start playing lost ark however it will suddenly just shut off and its usually always during high gpu usage. I replaced all thermal paste and pads to eliminate overheating. Any ideas of a fix?

 @usnboy33 sounds like it may just be overheating. Check the temps when you run your computer and since you already did replace the thermal paste, I assume you used some good quality paste. I would furthermore ensure that the fan and airway to the case are clean and possibly replace the fan. It may have worn. You can check the rpm on those as well. For both the temp and RPM there are plenty of Apps you can download that will help with that. Also, let us know what your Event Viewer shows and it might provide you with the information needed. Not sure which version Win you are using but something like this
Open Start.Search for Event Viewer and click the top result to open the console.Browse the following path: Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Systemshould get you to the viewer
Not sure about what your processing power settings look like but I would try and lower those, turn off any kind of overclocking your computer that is setup on your computer. Make sure that you have the newest driver for your video card/setup. With a memory checking app ensure that your memory is not the issue here.
