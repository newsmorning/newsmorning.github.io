It can be quite alarming when your laptop is taking forever to shut down or hibernate, and it only gets worse when this problem persists regularly. But don’t worry; we have got you covered. These five simple hacks will help you fix your Dell XPS 13 and bid adieu to those never-ending shutdowns.\nRun System Maintenance Troubleshooter: The first and most elementary step is to run the system maintenance troubleshooter. It is designed to detect and fix issues that may hinder the computer’s performance. To access the troubleshooter, go to the Control Panel, select System and Security, and then click Troubleshoot common computer problems. From the options, choose System Maintenance, and let the wizard do its work. After the process is completed, restart your computer, and see if the problem is gone.\nCheck for Software Conflicts: The next step is to check for any software conflicts that may be causing the never-ending shutdowns. This can be done by opening the Event Viewer and looking for any errors or conflicts in the system logs. To open Event Viewer, type “eventvwr” in the search bar and press Enter. From there, navigate to Windows Logs and check for any errors in the System and Application sections. If you find any, try uninstalling the related software or updating it.\nUpdate Your Drivers: Another common cause of never-ending shutdowns is outdated or corrupted drivers. So, the next step is to update your drivers to their latest versions. You can do this manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and downloading the updated drivers, or you can use Driver Easy, a tool that automates the process of updating your drivers. Driver Easy scans your computer and identifies any outdated or corrupted drivers, then updates them with a click of a button.\nAdjust Power Settings: Sometimes, the power settings configured on your laptop can cause the never-ending shutdown problem. To fix this, you need to adjust the power settings to optimize performance. To do this, go to Control Panel, select Power Options, and then choose High Performance. From there, click on Change plan settings and then click on Change advanced power settings. In the Advanced Settings tab, set the options for Sleep and Hibernate to Never, and hit OK.\nDisable Fast Startup: Lastly, if none of the above methods worked, you can try disabling Fast Startup. This feature is designed to speed up the boot time of your computer, but it can also cause problems, including never-ending shutdowns. To disable Fast Startup, you need to go to Control Panel, select Power Options, click on Choose what the power button does, and then click on Change settings that are currently unavailable. From there, uncheck the box next to Turn on fast startup, and click on Save changes.\nIn Conclusion:\nNever-ending shutdowns can be a frustrating problem, but with these simple hacks, you can fix your Dell XPS 13 and get back to using it without any issues.
