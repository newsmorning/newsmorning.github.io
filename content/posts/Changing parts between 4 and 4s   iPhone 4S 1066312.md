Are you tired of your old iPhone and looking to upgrade but don't want to spend a fortune on a new one? Well, you're in luck because you won't believe how easy it is to change parts between iPhone 4 and 4S.

The iPhone 4 and 4S are very similar in design and share many of the same internal components, making it possible to swap parts between the two models. This means that you can upgrade your phone in minutes without the need for any specialized skills or tools.

In this article, we'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to upgrade your iPhone 4 to a 4S by changing parts.

Step 1 - Gather the Required Parts

Before you start, you'll need to gather the necessary parts. Here's a list of the parts you'll need:

- iPhone 4S back cover
- iPhone 4S logic board
- iPhone 4S battery
- iPhone 4S rear camera
- iPhone 4S vibrator motor
- iPhone 4S volume buttons

You can purchase these parts online from any reputable electronic store. Once you have received the parts, proceed to the next step.

Step 2 - Take the iPhone 4 Apart

To access the internal parts of the iPhone 4, you'll need to remove the back cover. You can do this by removing the two screws located at the bottom of the phone with a pentalobe screwdriver. Once the screws are removed, slide the back cover up and lift it off the phone.

Next, remove the battery by unscrewing the two screws holding it in place and lifting it out of the phone. Then, remove the rear camera and vibrator motor by unscrewing the screws and disconnecting their respective cables from the logic board.

Step 3 - Swap the Parts

Now that you have access to the internal parts of the phone, it's time to swap them out. First, insert the new iPhone 4S battery into the phone and screw it in place.

Next, install the iPhone 4S logic board by aligning it with the connectors and screwing it in place. Once this is done, you can reattach the rear camera and vibrator motor by connecting their cables to the logic board and screwing them back in place.

Finally, replace the back cover with the new iPhone 4S cover and screw it into place using the pentalobe screwdriver.

Step 4 - Power On Your New iPhone 4S

You're almost done! Insert the SIM card and power on your new iPhone 4S. You should see the Apple logo appear, and your phone should boot up normally.

Congratulations! You have now successfully upgraded your iPhone 4 to a 4S by changing parts.

In conclusion, upgrading your iPhone doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. With just a few simple steps and the right parts, you can easily switch out the internal components of your iPhone 4 and 4S. So why wait? Upgrade your phone today and enjoy the latest features and functionality at a fraction of the cost!

## Chosen Solution
 Hey,
I was trying to fix my oldie half alive iphone 4(it is locked with the passcode which I don't remember, been a long time haha) , changing some parts from broken-screen iphone 4s.
1) Is it okay to do it ?
2) Is it possible to change something(i don't know which part it might be) where the information about this phone is held(passcode etc.)
Thanks for answering!

 You can change the LCD assembly.
If its just a simple passcode lock, put the phone in DFU mode and reflash iOS.
