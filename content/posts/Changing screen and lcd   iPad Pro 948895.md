# Revamp Your iPad Pro Like a Pro: Unveiling the Ultimate Hack for Changing Your Screen and LCD!

When it comes to mobile technology, the Apple iPad Pro is one of the most versatile and powerful devices on the market. While the iPad Pro is durable and built to last, accidents can happen. If you drop your iPad Pro or it gets damaged in some other way, the screen can crack or the LCD can become faulty, making it difficult or impossible to use.

Fortunately, there is a solution. By replacing the screen and LCD on your iPad Pro, you can restore it to its former glory and get back to using it just like you did when it was new. While replacing the screen and LCD may sound like a daunting task, with the right tools and guidance, you can do it yourself and save a considerable amount of money.

In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know to revamp your iPad Pro like a pro by changing your screen and LCD. We’ll go over the tools you’ll need, the steps you’ll need to take, and some tips and tricks to make the process easier.

## Tools You’ll Need

Before you get started, you’ll need a few tools to help you replace the screen and LCD on your iPad Pro. Here’s what you’ll need:

- A heat gun or hair dryer
- A spudger or other plastic pry tool
- A Phillips screwdriver
- A suction cup
- A replacement screen and LCD (make sure it’s compatible with your iPad Pro model)

## Step-by-step Guide

Now that you have everything you need, it’s time to get started. Follow these steps to replace the screen and LCD on your iPad Pro:

1. Power off your iPad Pro and use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws from the bottom of the device.

2. Use the heat gun or hair dryer to soften the adhesive around the edge of the screen.

3. Use the suction cup to lift the screen away from the device. Be gentle, as the screen is still attached to the device by cables.

4. Use the spudger to gently pry open the clips holding the cables in place.

5. Use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws holding the LCD in place.

6. Carefully remove the LCD from the device.

7. Attach the new LCD to the device and use the Phillips screwdriver to secure it in place.

8. Reattach the cables to the new LCD and carefully clip them into place with the spudger.

9. Use the heat gun or hair dryer to soften the adhesive around the edge of the device.

10. Carefully place the new screen on top of the device and press it down gently to reattach the adhesive.

11. Use the Phillips screwdriver to replace the screws at the bottom of the device.

12. Power on your iPad Pro and test the new screen and LCD to make sure everything works properly.

## Tips and Tricks

Here are a few additional tips and tricks to make replacing your iPad Pro’s screen and LCD even easier:

- Take your time and be patient. This isn’t a quick process, and rushing could cause further damage to your device.

- Use a clean, flat surface to work on. This will help prevent any dust, dirt, or other particles from getting into your iPad Pro.

- Keep your screws organized. There are several screws involved in this process, so it’s important to keep track of where they go.

- Watch instructional videos online for additional guidance. Seeing someone else replace an iPad Pro screen and LCD can be a great way to get a better understanding of the process before you try it yourself.

By following these steps and tips, you can successfully revamp your iPad Pro like a pro by changing your screen and LCD. With a little bit of patience and the right tools, you can save a considerable amount of money by doing it yourself instead of taking it to a professional. Good luck!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I broke my ipad pro 12.9” screen model a1670. If I buy the new one that offers fullset, will my touch id still works? Because if I have to do some soldering, I don't have the abilty.. Someone says that the ipad pro middle flexible locaten on the screen is crutial so we have to include the old one to the new one.

 In order to retain touch ID functionality, you need to salvage original home button from broken screen and transfer to the new one.
Buy a replacement screen with daughterboard pre-installed (‘the middle flex’ circled in picture) to save yourself the hassle of soldering, from any reputable vendors like iFixit and MobileSentrix.
