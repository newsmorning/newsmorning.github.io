Get Ready to Fall Head Over Heels: 5 Reasons Why Microsoft Edge Browser Will Be Your New Obsession!

As one of the most dominant tech companies, Microsoft has always been known for setting new standards and creating dramatic waves of innovation across the industry. A few years ago, Microsoft introduced its new web browser 'Edge' to the public – a giant leap forward that marked the beginning of a new era in browsing experience.

While the Edge browser initially had a rocky start, over the years, Microsoft has been consistently improving its performance and adding features and functionalities that truly make it stand out in the market. In this article, we will explore five solid reasons why Microsoft Edge will be your new obsession and why it is indeed the future of web browsing.

1. Speed and Performance

Microsoft Edge is perhaps one of the fastest browsers on the market, boasting lightning-fast speed and unbeatable performance. This is achieved by using a powerful new rendering engine, which is engineered to take full advantage of the computing power of modern devices. Moreover, the Edge browser is optimized for touch and pen inputs, making it an excellent choice for users who prefer using touch screen devices like tablets and laptops.

2. Cross-Platform Compatibility

Another excellent feature of Microsoft Edge is its cross-platform compatibility. This means that the Edge browser is available on multiple devices, including Windows 10, macOS, iOS, and Android. Additionally, the Edge browser is synchronized to your Microsoft account, meaning that your browsing history, bookmarks, and passwords will be available on all your devices, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

3. Innovative Features

One of the most significant advantages of Microsoft Edge is that it comes with a plethora of innovative features and functionalities that make browsing not only enjoyable but also productive. For instance, Edge offers a built-in PDF viewer, which eliminates the need for a third-party app. Moreover, Edge has a powerful built-in note-taking feature that allows users to annotate websites, take screenshots, and save content to their notes.

4. Enhanced Security and Privacy

Microsoft Edge has been designed with security and privacy in mind. The browser features advanced privacy features such as a tracking prevention feature that blocks third-party trackers from collecting your data. Furthermore, Edge is equipped with SmartScreen technology that detects and warns users of phishing and malware attacks, ensuring that your browsing experience is secure.

5. Better Accessibility

Microsoft Edge has a set of built-in accessibility features that ensure that everyone can use the browser, regardless of their physical abilities. Edge supports keyboard shortcuts, high contrast mode, and a read-aloud feature that can read the content on a website.

In conclusion, Microsoft Edge is indeed the future of web browsing. With its lightning-fast speed, cross-platform compatibility, innovative features, enhanced security, and better accessibility, it's hard to find another browser that can compete with Microsoft Edge. So why not give it a try yourself and see why it will be your new obsession?

A lot of us have been using the Google Chrome browser for a really long time now, on our personal computers and our smartphones, forgetting that there are other browsers equally as good, or even better. The Microsoft Edge browser is one such browser. It is Microsoft’s main browser and it was recently revamped and is now built on Chromium open-source technology. Here are 5 things to love about the new Microsoft Edge browser. 
 
## 1. Privacy
 
This is the most important thing to consider before using any service or website on the internet. Platforms like Google, for instance, collect user data on their platform and uses it to tailor the ads that we see while we surf different websites. And while personalized ads are indeed very helpful, they can sometimes be annoying when websites won’t stop tracking you. 
 
What the tracking prevention feature on the Microsoft Edge browser does is, it protects you from being tracked by websites that you aren’t accessing directly. It lets you control what you see and what you don’t want to. Microsoft Edge tracking prevention feature gives you three levels of privacy protection to choose from: Basic, Balanced, and Strict.

## 2. Vertical Tabs
 
This is one feature I really like and it has been helpful so far. I personally like to work with a lot of tabs open in my browser at the same time. Normally, they are displayed horizontally at the top of your browser, and the more tabs I open, the smaller other tabs become, making it difficult to find specific tabs, and sometimes, accidentally closing them. This can sometimes be really frustrating. 
 
On the Microsoft Edge browser, however, you have the option of arranging your tabs vertically, on the left side of your browser. This way, all your tab titles remain visible, regardless of the number of tabs you have open at the time. 
 
To switch to the vertical option, all you have to do is tap on the little square icon on the top-left corner of your Edge browser, then select Turn on vertical tabs and all your open tabs will immediately move to the left side of your screen. You also get to collapse the vertical tabs to look like your regular horizontal tabs – only, this time, it is sitting vertically on the left.
 
## 3. Web Capture
 
While doing our usual researches on the web, we oftentimes copy vital data or information and paste them into a document we’re working on. It can, however, be frustrating when you copy a particular text and it ends up in an entirely different format. The web capture feature makes it easier to select, copy and paste the exact content you want from the web and you get to keep it in the original text format. 
 
## 4. Immersive Reader
 
Immersive Reader is a feature on Microsoft Edge that I have found to be really useful since I started using the browser. The feature makes reading online easier for everyone. It strips out all the visual distractions like ads and popup videos and helps you concentrate on the text you’re reading. If you have reading disabilities or you find it difficult to focus on text on a webpage with other distractions appearing, this feature will solve your that.
 
To enable this feature, first, you need to open the web content you want to read, and in the address bar, you should see a little book icon. Immersive Reader will be activated once you tap on it.
 
## 5. Read Aloud
 
In addition to the Immersive Reader feature, you also have the Read Aloud tool which helps you read the text aloud – saving you time and energy. You can also customize the experience by switching the voice option to your preferred accent. The Read Aloud option is at the top of the Immersive Reader page.  
 
There you have it. Some of the best features that are available on the Microsoft Edge browser. Which of these features do you find interesting and helpful? Tell you in the comments section below.
