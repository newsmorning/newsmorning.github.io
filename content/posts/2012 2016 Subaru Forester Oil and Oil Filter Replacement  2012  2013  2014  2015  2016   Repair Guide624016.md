# You Won't BELIEVE The Shocking Reason Why You Need To Replace Your Subaru Forester's Oil and Oil Filter!

As a Subaru Forester owner, you love your car's handling, safety, and style, but did you know that regular oil changes are important for maintaining its performance as well? Keeping fresh oil and a clean filter in your Forester can help keep the engine running smoothly and help prevent costly repairs down the road.

The shocking truth is that many Forester owners don't realize their car's oil and filter need to be changed every 7,500 miles or 6 months, whichever comes first. When you neglect this routine maintenance, your car's engine can become less efficient and less reliable over time, causing a variety of problems that could have been avoided.

In this article, I'll show you how to change the oil and filter in a 2012-2016 Subaru Forester yourself, at home, to save money and keep your car running like new.

Recent models of Subarus come with synthetic oil or semi-synthetic oil, which lasts longer than conventional oil but costs more. Advances in oil composition mean that modern cars can go longer between oil changes than older cars. The oil is also better at cleaning the engine and protecting it against wear and tear.

Even though synthetic oil lasts longer than older-style oils, the oil filter still needs to be changed regularly. As oil circulates through the engine, it picks up microscopic contaminants that can damage engine components over time if they're not trapped by the filter.

If you're not sure whether it's time to change your car's oil and filter, consult the owner's manual. The manual will specify how often the car's oil and filter need to be changed, as well as what type of oil and filter are recommended. And don't forget to check the oil level regularly too- some vehicles consume more oil between changes than others.

If it's time to change the oil and filter, here's how you can do it yourself:

## Step 1: Gather the necessary tools and materials.

Manuals and online tutorials explain the necessary tool and equipment required to change the engine oil and filter.

* Oil filter wrench
* 17mm wrench for oil bolt
* Oil filter
* New oil (use the recommended oil for your car)
* Drain pan
* Funnel
* Hand pump (or gravity-fed) oil extractor (optional)

When you go to buy oil, you might see that it comes in different weights, such as 5W-30 or 10W-40. The number before the "W" refers to the viscosity of the oil when it's cold, while the number after the "W" refers to the viscosity when it's hot. The owner's manual will specify which weight of oil is correct for your car.

## Step 2: Prepare your car for the oil change.

Before you start the oil change, make sure your Subaru Forester is on level ground and the engine is warm. Then, locate the oil drain plug under the car, typically underneath the engine block. An alternative is to remove the oil at the top of the engine and avoid crawling under the car.

Put the drain pan underneath the plug so that the old oil will spill into it, rather than onto the ground.

## Step 3: Drain the old oil.

Use your wrench to remove the oil drain plug and let the oil flow out into the pan. Once the oil stops flowing out, replace the plug and tighten it by hand.

## Step 4: Change the oil filter.

The oil filter will be located on the same side of the engine as the oil pump. If you have a filter wrench, use it to unscrew and remove the filter. If not, wrap a rag around the filter to get a good grip and turn it counterclockwise to remove it.

Before you install the new filter, take a little bit of clean oil and rub it around the gasket (the rubber seal) of the new filter. This will help create a tight seal when you screw it on.

After filling the new oil filter with oil, screw it in place until you feel resistance, and then give it another three-quarters of a turn. It's important not to overtighten the filter, as it can cause leaks.

## Step 5: Refill with new oil.

Now it's time to refill the engine with new oil. Remove the oil filler cap on the top of the engine and use a funnel to pour the oil into the engine through the oil filler hole. As you fill the engine with oil, use a dipstick to check that you've added the correct amount (use the manual for guidance) because it is important to avoid under or overfilling the engine.

Start the engine and let it run for about 30 seconds to allow the new oil to circulate throughout the engine. Check your oil level, add more oil if necessary, and double-check everything to make sure there are no leaks or loose connections.

In conclusion, keeping your Subaru Forester's oil and filter changed regularly can help you avoid costly trips to the mechanic and keep your car running smoothly. By following this step-by-step guide, you can keep your car in good shape and take pride in knowing you've done the job yourself.

Have 2017 Subaru Forester.  Book says nothing about removing panel to get to the oil plug and this instruction says nothing about removing the panel to get to the oil plug.  Looks like I have to pry the panel off to get to the plug but will call Subaru later today to see what they say.  Seems ridiculous to have a panel with 5 keepers that have to be removed every time you change the oil just to get to the oil plug and then say nothing in the book about removing the cover.  Your instruction also needs updated regarding the oil plug cover on a 2017 Subaru Forester.

If the location of the oil pan and plug has changed, then a new guide should be created for 2017 models. This is labeled 2012-2016 because it applies to those model years. I'm not familiar with the panel under the 2017, so I can't provide any updates.

leaders or quarts of oil? My2016 forester calls for 5.1 quarts of oil
 
It's Quarts, not Liters. I had updated it in the tools a while ago but missed it in the step. Updated.

I have a lot of problems with all of my 2016 Forester manuals.  They put numbers on the illustrations, but no numbers in the manual.  My Sirius XM manual is at least 6 times thicker than the owner's manual.   Why isn't there instructions on how to refill all the fluids in the maintenance manual.  I don't need to take it to the dealer for everything!
