I even tried with my original cable that i got with phone but its still the same but it works fine inside the home even with the usb cable that i bought to charge in my car. wonder does anyone had this issue and how its resolved….\nIf your car USB port isn’t charging your phone, the problem could be with the port, the cable, or even the phone. Not all car USB ports are designed to charge phones, or power peripheral devices at all, so there’s a chance that you’re dealing with that type of situation.\nIt sounds like a blown fuse in the car. Check your fuses for the USB charging port or cigarette lighter of the car, depending on where you have the phone plugged in to charge. The fuses are typically located under the hood, on the left of the driver just below the dash or in the dash, and sometimes you need OR to identify whether or not the USB port or cigarette lighter are working, try plugging in another device that is known to work. There’s another item to touch base on here which is the charge cable itself. While this may not be at fault here, it is always recommended to use only original equipment charge adapters and USB cables. I have seen generic/cheap chargers work fine sometimes and others have completely fried the cable, the charge port of the phone, or the charging chip on the logic board of the phone.\n","wordCount":"649","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Harold Moran"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/charging-issue-while-try-to-charge-using-usb-cable-in-car-samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-1915924/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe What's Happening When This Samsung S8 Plus Gets Plugged Into A Car - Charging Nightmare!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 6, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;649 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Harold Moran</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: You Won&rsquo;t Believe What&rsquo;s Happening When This Samsung S8 Plus Gets Plugged Into a Car - Charging Nightmare!</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Owning a Samsung S8 Plus is every tech geek&rsquo;s dream come true.
