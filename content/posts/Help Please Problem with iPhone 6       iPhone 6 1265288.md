Unlock the Secret to Fixing Your iPhone 6 - Don't Miss Out on These Expert Tips!

Owning an iPhone 6 is a luxury that comes with its downsides. The one downside that most iPhone 6 users dread is the probability of facing technical glitches that undoubtedly arise with time. Apart from the added expense of repairs and replacements, it is also frustrating and time-consuming to deal with them. 

However, do not let these issues discourage you. There is a way to overcome them and prolong the life of your iPhone 6. By following these expert tips, you can unlock the secret to fixing your iPhone 6 without relying solely on the iPhone repair shops.

1. Battery Life

One of the most common issues with the iPhone 6 is its poor battery life. If you're an avid iPhone user, you probably know the feeling of having your phone die on you due to a dead battery. The good news is that you can improve your battery life without having to replace it. Here are a few tips to help you conserve your battery power:

- Change your Display Settings: Go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock, and lower the auto-lock time to 30 seconds or less.
- Turn off Notifications: This is especially helpful for apps that you don't use frequently. Go to Settings > Notifications, and turn off notifications for any apps that aren't critical.
- Background App Refresh: Turning off this feature can save a significant amount of battery life. Go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh, and turn off the apps that you don't need.

2. Broken Screen

Having a broken screen is undoubtedly one of the most frustrating iPhone issues. However, it can be fixed without taking it to a repair shop. Here are a few easy tips to handle your cracked screen:

- Buy a Screen Protector: A screen protector can reduce the chances of your phone screen breaking in the future. It is the best option for those who want to avoid a costly repair.
- Repair the Screen Yourself: You can purchase a do-it-yourself kit that includes all the necessary tools and instructions. Although it may seem daunting, with the right kit and a little patience, repairing it yourself can be a quick and easy process.

3. Storage Issues

If you've owned an iPhone 6 for a while, you've likely experienced the frustration of constantly getting the message "Storage Full." However, clearing your storage space is easier than you think. Here are a few tips to help you free up some storage:

- Turn on iCloud Photo Library: This feature will automatically store the full-resolution photos and videos on Apple's servers while keeping smaller versions on your phone.
- Delete Unnecessary Apps: Look at the apps that you don't use frequently, and delete them to free up storage.
- Clear Cached Data and History: Go to Settings > Safari, and clear your cache, cookies, and browsing history.

In conclusion, dealing with iPhone 6 technical issues can be frustrating, but with the right tips, you can quickly resolve them and prolong the life of your phone. By following these expert tips, you'll be able to avoid costly repairs or replacements and keep your iPhone 6 running smoothly for a longer time.

## Chosen Solution
 Actually, the iPhone was perfectly normal...Once i kept the iPhone beside my head and unfortunately that day, water from the air conditioner(above my head)fell inside and made my iPhone completely wet as the droplets of water fell directly on the earpiece...I was shocked to see the iPhone in the morning...I tried to jerk my iPhone and there was huge amount of water coming out from it as if it was a spray can..I removed the sim and opened it up and removed the battery and kept it inside rice for 2 days..
the phone was completely dried and then i tried to insert the battery again and the phone to the surprise turned on and yeah the phone was perfectly normal for more than a month however the plastic indicator in it became red and the screen had certain white spots but the earpiece speaker everything was sounding right...i was running ios 10.3.2...everything was perfect...
After some days when ios 11 was out,i tried to update the iPhone and thats when it all went away.. the phone perfectly turns on and after 1-2 mins..it will suddenly flash a black screen and restart...this has been very very annoying..i checked the analytics and its full of kernel panics bug type 210,211 blah blah.. the thing which i couldn't understand is that, how was it running perfectly in ios 10.3.2 but not in ios 11.2(presently)...
Even i replaced the battery and the old screen which had some white spots in it... i also cant downgrade to ios 10.3.2 anymore..so stuck..:-(..i just need to get rid of the random reboot problem and everything is fine..and i am not in the mood of getting a new one or to get it replaced as it has gone quite old...Any helps would be highly appreciated...Feeling helpless:-((

 Have you tried updating the phone through iTunes? You will need to force the phone into recovery mode, use the instructions linked here but do not restore if you want to keep data on the phone:
