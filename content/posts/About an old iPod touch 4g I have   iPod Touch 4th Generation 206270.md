I recently came across my old iPod Touch 4G while cleaning out my closet. As I charged it up, I was hit with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. This little device was my constant companion during my teenage years, and it had seen me through countless commutes, study sessions and gym workouts. I wondered if it still had any music or apps on it that I used to love. Spoiler alert: it did. 

The first thing I noticed upon turning the device on was how different it felt compared to modern smartphones. The small screen, thick bezels and physical home button felt archaic compared to the sleek, edge-to-edge designs we have now. But as I navigated through the familiar interface, I couldn't help but smile at the memories it brought back. 

The top item on my agenda was checking if any of my old music was still on there. As someone who grew up during the golden age of pop punk and emo, my iPod was chock-full of hits from the likes of Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco and My Chemical Romance. I clicked on the "Music" app, and to my surprise, found that over 600 songs were still there. It was like a time capsule of my teenage angst. 

Next up, I scrolled through my old apps. Remember when Angry Birds was the game everyone was obsessed with? Or when Instagram only had one filter? Those were the days. I was surprised to see that some of my favorite games and social media apps still worked on the outdated operating system. The graphics were a far cry from what we have now, but it was strange and comforting to see the familiar logos and user interfaces again. 

But the real treasure trove of nostalgia lay in my photos and videos. I had forgotten just how many memories were stored on that tiny device. There were photos from family vacations, blurry selfies with friends, and cringe-worthy outfits from my middle school days. Watching the videos was like reliving my childhood again. I saw clips of me and my siblings singing and dancing in our living room, and footage of my first-ever concert (Paramore, if you were wondering). 

It's funny how a piece of technology that was once cutting-edge can feel so quaint and outdated just a few years later. But revisiting my old iPod Touch 4G was an unexpectedly heartwarming experience. It reminded me of a simpler time, before the stresses of adulthood and the endless scroll of social media. It's easy to get caught up in the rush for the latest and greatest gadgets, but sometimes it's nice to slow down and appreciate what came before. So if you have an old iPod or cellphone lying around, I highly recommend taking a trip down memory lane. You never know what you might find.

## Chosen Solution
 so i have this iPod touch 4th gen 32 gb with a broken logic board. It has sentimental value which is why i wanna fix it. Finding a replacement logic board is proving to be very hard. After contacting ifixit support and looking everywhere online this would be my last hope if someone can get hold of one online or help me find one.

 I know it’s been a bit since you asked this question, but now Ifixit does actually sell the part you’re looking for. however, since you are trying to fix your iPod for sentimental purposes, and likely want the things stored on it, I regret to inform you the memory is stored on the NAND memory IC's on the logic board. Meaning if you did replace the board, all of the iPod’s storage would be gone.
