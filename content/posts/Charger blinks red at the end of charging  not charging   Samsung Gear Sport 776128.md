Is Your Samsung Gear Sport Charger Malfunctioning? Discover the Alarming Reason Why the Blinking Red Light Could Mean Game Over for Your Device!

If you're like most Samsung Gear Sport owners, you depend on your device to keep track of your workouts, notifications, and other daily tasks. However, if you've noticed that your Gear Sport isn't charging properly, you could be in for a rude awakening.

The most common issue that Gear Sport users experience with their chargers is a blinking red light. This usually indicates that there is a problem with the charging process, and your device is not getting the power it needs to function correctly.

So, what could be causing this malfunction? According to Samsung, the blinking red light could mean that there is a problem with the charging dock or the power source itself. In other words, your charger may be damaged, or the outlet you're using may not be delivering enough power.

If you're experiencing this issue, we recommend taking the following steps to troubleshoot the problem:

1. Check the power source: Make sure that the outlet you're plugging your charging dock into is functioning correctly. If you're using a power strip, try plugging the dock directly into the wall to rule out any issues with the strip.

2. Clean the charging dock: Over time, the charging dock can become dirty or clogged with debris. Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe the dock clean and remove any dirt or grime that may be interfering with the charging process.

3. Inspect the charging dock for damage: Look for any cracks or other damage to the charging dock that could be preventing it from charging your device properly. If you see any damage, you may need to replace the dock.

4. Contact Samsung: If none of the above solutions work, your best bet is to reach out to Samsung for assistance. They may be able to diagnose the problem and provide you with a replacement charger if necessary.

It's crucial to take action if you notice your Gear Sport isn't charging correctly because, without a charged battery, your device won't function correctly. You may be unable to track your workouts or receive notifications and updates, which could be disastrous if you rely on your device for these functions.

So, if you're experiencing a blinking red light on your Samsung Gear Sport charger, don't ignore it. Take the steps outlined above to troubleshoot the issue and get back to using your device as quickly as possible.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, my Samsung Gear Sport SM-R600 recently started having charging issues. The factory charging dock will start blinking red at the end of a charge and my watch will begin draining its battery.   I typically place my watch in the dock every night (power is usually at around 50%) and have been recently waking up to less than 15% charge in the morning, which is strange because not charging the watch would have left me with more power than putting it on the dock (a full charge usually lasts me roughly 2 days).
I have tried the following:
Different outletDifferent USB charger (same dock)Different USB cableDeep cleaned watch back and charging dock faceRebooted
None of these have shown any improvement. Also, I have yet to do a factory reset.
Any idea what the problem might be? I am thinking of purchasing another charging dock to see if that is the issue, or perhaps there is an issue with my watch battery?  Other than the charging issue, my watch performs just fine. The battery life is just as good as before.
Any tips, tricks, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 water inside, I had the same problem, I opened the smartwatch cleaned of oxide and returned to charge and work, now I have to replace the heart rate sensor that was damaged. but the watch works perfectly.
