If you are a Scion Fr S owner, you know that maintaining your car is of utmost importance. One of the essential aspects of taking care of your car is changing the oil and filter regularly. This ensures that the engine remains clean, lubricated, and well-functioning. However, many car owners find oil and filter replacement to be a daunting task. But have no fear, we have a simple step-by-step guide to make this process a breeze!\nTools Needed Before we begin, here are the tools you will need for this task:\nA wrench An oil filter wrench A new oil filter A new oil drain plug washer A funnel A drain pan The recommended amount of oil for your Scion Fr S (generally 5 quarts) Step 1: Prepare Your Vehicle First, make sure that your car is parked on a level surface, and the engine is cool. Also, ensure that you have all the necessary tools on hand before you begin.\nStep 2: Drain the Old Oil Locate the oil drain plug. It is underneath your car, at the bottom of your engine. Using your wrench, turn the drain plug counter-clockwise to release the old oil. Make sure that you have your drain pan ready to catch the oil as it flows out. Once the oil has completely drained, replace the oil drain plug washer, and tighten the plug securely.\nStep 3: Replace the Oil Filter The oil filter is located close to the oil drain plug. Using your oil filter wrench, remove the old oil filter. Be careful not to spill the old oil. Clean the filter bracket by wiping off any debris or dirt. Take your new oil filter and lubricate the gasket with some of the new oil. Install the new filter onto its bracket, using your hand only, and then tighten the filter with an oil filter wrench.\nStep 4: Add New Oil Using a funnel, slowly pour the recommended amount of new oil into the engine. Avoid overfilling, as this can lead to engine damage. Once you have added the correct amount of oil, start your engine and allow it to run for a minute or two. This will circulate the new oil, making sure it reaches all the components. Afterward, turn off the engine and check the oil level on the dipstick.\nConclusion Changing the oil and filter in your Scion Fr S is not as tough as it seems. You can follow the simple steps outlined above to do it yourself. However, if you are not confident about performing this task, or for any reason, you cannot do it yourself, you should seek the help of a qualified mechanic. Regularly replacing your car’s oil and filter will keep your engine running smoothly, preventing costly repairs and ensuring your car lasts for longer.\nDifficulty\nEasy\nSteps\n9\nTime Required\n20 minutes Sections\n1\nOil and Oil Filter 9 steps Flags\nMember-Contributed Guide An awesome member of our community made this guide.
