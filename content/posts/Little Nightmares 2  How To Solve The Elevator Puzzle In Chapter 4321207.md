# Discover The Secret To Solving The Toughest Puzzle Yet in Little Nightmares 2 - Conquer Chapter 4's Elevator Mystery Now!

Are you stuck on Chapter 4 of Little Nightmares 2, trying to figure out how to solve the elevator puzzle? Don't worry, you're not alone. This puzzle has proven to be one of the toughest challenges in the game, leaving many players scratching their heads. But fear not, we're here to help you conquer this mystery and move forward in the game.

First, let's review the problem. Chapter 4 opens with Six and Mono standing in front of an elevator. As soon as you enter, the elevator will go up for a few floors, and then abruptly stop. The only way to get it moving again is to solve a puzzle. The elevator has four floors, with a different room on each floor. You'll have to navigate each room and push a button to unlock the next floor until you reach the top. Sounds easy enough, right? Except, every time you unlock a floor, the elevator will start to move again, and you'll have to rush back to the elevator before it leaves without you.

So, how do you solve this puzzle?

The first thing you need to do is to explore the rooms on each floor. You'll notice that each room has a different object that you can interact with. These objects are key to solving the puzzle. Let's take a look at each floor and what you need to do.

**Floor 1:**

This room is relatively straightforward. You will see a lever on the wall that you need to pull. Doing so will unlock the next floor. The trick is to run back to the elevator quickly because it starts to move as soon as you pull the lever.

**Floor 2:**

On the second floor, you will find a wooden box. You need to push this box to the right side of the room and use it to climb onto the table. Once you're on the table, jump onto the top of the elevator and ride it up to the next floor.

**Floor 3:**

The third floor is where things get a bit more complicated. In this room, you will find two buttons on the wall. However, both buttons need to be pushed at the same time to unlock the next floor. To do this, you need to use a hanging lamp in the room. Position the lamp so that it swings and hits both buttons at the same time.

**Floor 4:**

The final floor is the trickiest of them all. This room is pitch black, and you can't see anything. You'll have to rely on sound to figure out what you need to do. There's a switch on the wall you need to flip. You'll hear a sound when you do, and that will tell you that the door to the elevator has opened. Run back to the elevator and jump inside to complete the puzzle.

And that's it! By following these steps, you can solve the elevator puzzle in Chapter 4 of Little Nightmares 2. It's not an easy puzzle, but don't get discouraged. Take your time, explore each room thoroughly, and use your wits and skills to overcome the challenges. Good luck, and may you conquer the mysteries of the Maw!
