 Hi there,
my phone dos not open any audio files and wen i try to do a phone call it freezes.
I think the sound chip is dead.
I need help to locate it in the motherboard and to find the model of the sound chip.

This " i try to do a phone call it freezes." is usually not a sign of a bad audio IC.I believe your audio IC is a MT6331
