Shocking Discovery: iPhone 5 Batteries are Showing Abnormal Behavior - Find out Why!

If you are an iPhone 5 user, then you might be in for a surprise as it has been found that the batteries of this phone are showing abnormal behavior. This discovery comes as a shock to many who have been using the phone for years and are now experiencing issues with their batteries.

The issue has been reported by many users who are seeing a sudden drop in battery life even when the phone is not in use, and in some cases, the battery percentage drops from 100% to 1% within a few minutes. This abnormal behavior is not only frustrating but can also be dangerous in situations where users rely on their phones to make emergency calls or to stay connected during a power outage.

So, what is causing this problem? It appears that the issue is related to the batteries used in the iPhone 5. The batteries in question have limited charge cycles, and after multiple years of use, they start to degrade, resulting in a sudden drop in battery life. In some cases, the battery may even swell, causing the phone to malfunction or become damaged.

Apple has recognized this issue and has offered a replacement program for eligible devices. However, some users are still experiencing issues even after getting their batteries replaced. This could be due to the fact that the replacements are made using the same technology and may also have the same limited charge cycles.

To avoid such issues in the future, it is recommended that users avoid overcharging their phones and keep the battery level between 20% and 80%. It is also advisable to avoid using a damaged or swollen battery as it can cause further damage to the device.

In conclusion, the abnormal behavior of iPhone 5 batteries is a cause for concern for many users. However, by following some basic battery health tips and getting their batteries replaced, users can avoid this issue and ensure the optimal performance of their devices. So, if you are an iPhone 5 user, keep an eye out for any battery-related issues and take the necessary precautions to keep your phone safe and functional.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi guys,
I am using an iPhone 5 as my spare phone. One day, I noticed that the battery was draining very quickly and cannot hold the charge. Hence, I ordered a new battery to replace it. The new one worked better, but still drained very fast and fully dead after 12 hours without me using it at all. I observed a few abnormal things:
After fully drained, I plugged in the charging cable. The phone awoke, the battery showed ~ 14% and it would slowly decrease to 0% (although there was 1A current flowing in, see  attached videos), shut off, show the battery charging icon and after a while, boot up again. Then it would charge normally to 100%.I used a software to look for the battery info. However, the software showed that the number of charge times is 0 although I have charged it 10+ times.
Can anyone diagnose the issue please? Thanks!

 Hi. Any gurus know a possible fix for the phone? :'(
