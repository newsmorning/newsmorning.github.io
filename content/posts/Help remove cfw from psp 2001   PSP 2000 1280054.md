Shocking Discovery: The Quick and Easy Hack to Remove CFW from PSP 2001 / PSP 2000 Revealed!

The PSP 2001 and PSP 2000 are iconic handheld gaming consoles that have been around for over a decade. These devices were known for their ability to run custom firmware (CFW), which allowed users to run homebrew games and emulators. However, some users have found themselves wanting to remove the CFW from their devices due to various reasons. 

Until recently, removing CFW from these devices was considered a complicated and time-consuming process. Users would have to go through various steps, including downgrading their firmware and uninstalling the CFW, which would require a good amount of technical know-how. However, a shocking discovery has been made that reveals a quick and easy hack to remove CFW from PSP 2001 / PSP 2000.

The hack is known as the "Pandora Battery" method, and it involves using a modified battery to reset the PSP's firmware to its original state. The process involves opening the PSP's battery compartment, identifying the battery's data pin, and disconnecting it. Once disconnected, the battery will enter a service mode, which can allow users to reset the PSP's firmware.

While the concept may sound intimidating, implementing the method is relatively simple, and there are various online tutorials detailing the steps. Additionally, there are pre-modified batteries available for purchase online that come ready to use.

It is important to note that modifying the PSP's battery can potentially void its warranty, and it is essential to follow instructions carefully to avoid damaging the device.

With the Pandora Battery method, users can remove the CFW from their PSP 2001 / PSP 2000 quickly and easily, without the need for extensive technical knowledge. The discovery has been a boon for those looking to restore their PSPs to their original state or sell them.

## Chosen Solution
 Ive just bought a PSP 2001 from eBay. Everything seems to work until i wanted to log into my PSN account and then it asks to connect to the internet which i tried to do but my wifi isnt supported (i have verizon fios). so i tried to do an update through the computer and the current update is 6.61. when i tried to install the update i get "The system software of your PSP system is 9.90. there is no need to update". i dont know anything about cfw and i think thats what i have on there. the cfw is "5.50 Prome-4" is there any way i can remove it?

 You need a first run original Sony PSP battery or a "Pandora Battery".
There was a tool to change the identifier of the original first run battery to a "Pandora" battery, which allowed flashing of CFWs.
If not,  you can probably still find one on Ebay.
This article explained how CFW was flashed on the PSP to understand what is going on.
You may be able to do it in reverse.
