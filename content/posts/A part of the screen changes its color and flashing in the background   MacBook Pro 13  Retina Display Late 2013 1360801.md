# You Won't Believe What This MacBook Pro is Doing - Sudden Color Change and Flashing! Find Out the Mysterious Reason Here!

As a MacBook Pro user, you might have experienced some strange things happening to your device. One of the most frustrating issues that can arise is a sudden change in color and flashing that could happen out of nowhere. You might be wondering what could be the reason behind this mysterious problem.

While this issue might seem alarming, there's no need to worry. We've got you covered with a detailed guide on the most probable reasons why your MacBook Pro is showing unusual behavior.

## Possible Causes of the Issue

There are a few reasons that could cause your MacBook Pro to change colors and start flashing suddenly. The most common ones include:

### 1. Overheating

Your MacBook Pro might change colors and start flashing due to overheating. When the CPU gets too hot, the device can start acting erratically, leading to screen glitches and color flashes. This issue usually happens when the computer has been running for prolonged periods or when it's doing heavy tasks such as gaming or video editing.

To fix this issue, you can try to cool down the device by placing it on a hard surface or a cooling pad. Additionally, you can clean the vents and internal components from dust and debris, which can hinder proper airflow.

### 2. Driver Issues

Another reason why your MacBook Pro can have color changes and flashing could be due to outdated or corrupt drivers. Graphics drivers enable communication between the hardware and software of your device. When there are issues with these drivers, it can cause your screen to flicker and change colors.

To fix this issue, update your device's operating system, check for graphics driver updates, or reinstall your graphic drivers.

### 3. Hardware Damage

Physical damage to your MacBook Pro's hardware can cause it to act up. If you have dropped or spilled liquid on your device, it can cause hardware damage that leads to screen flickering and color changes.

If the issue is hardware related, take your device to the nearest Apple Store or certified repair center to get it fixed.

### 4. Software Incompatibility

Certain software installed on your device might not be compatible with your MacBook Pro's hardware. This can cause your device to act up, leading to flickering and color changes.

To fix this issue, uninstall any recently installed software that might have caused the problem. Additionally, check for any software updates to your device.

## Final Thoughts

Experiencing color changes and flashing on your MacBook Pro can be alarming, but it's usually fixable. Understanding the various causes of this issue and how to troubleshoot them can help you address the problem without breaking a sweat.

If you've tried all the recommended fixes and the problem persists, it's best to take your MacBook Pro to an authorized service center for further diagnosis and repair. And with that, we hope this guide has helped you understand the mysterious reasons behind your device's behavior and provided you with the tools to fix it.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
my husband accidentally dropped my macbook pro 13 late 2013 on the ground, and the screen is partially changed the color (like show in the picture), the problem doesn’t show up when I connected to external monitor.  The computer is working perfectly fine except this problem. I don’t know if I need to change the whole display. Or if there is a way which can stop the flashing of the broken part. I don’t mind if the color changes or not. It’s just the flashing part is annoying. Thank you for the help!!

 Ouch! Not good ;-{ The internal display got the worse of it.
Sadly, there is nothing you can do to the display to fix the problem other than replacing the display assembly. Here’s the needed part: 13” MacBook Pro Display Assembly, Grade-B, Apple P/N 661-8153 and the guide to put it in MacBook Pro 13" Retina (Late 2013-Mid 2014) Display Assembly
