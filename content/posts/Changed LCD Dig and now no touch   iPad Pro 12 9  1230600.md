{{<intro>}}

A malfunctioning iPad Pro can be quite frustrating for anyone, especially for those who heavily rely on it. You might be tempted to try and fix the issue yourself, but sometimes, these DIY repairs can turn into a total disaster. In this article, we'll share a cautionary tale of how a simple LCD replacement ended in total touch failure, leaving an iPad Pro unusable.

{{<section1>}}

First things first, let's talk about the problem that led to the repair attempt. The owner of the iPad Pro noticed that the screen had a crack, which was affecting the display's functionality. Everything else seemed to be working correctly, but the broken screen was causing significant inconvenience.

This damage, unfortunately, occurs commonly between iPad Pro users, given the big size and thin glass. Typically, a cracked screen should not affect the touch screen, but some fragments could damage the connection.

Consequently, they searched the web for a reliable solution to repair the device, and after much research, they decided to replace the LCD screen themselves by following a YouTube tutorial. The decision to carry out the repair themselves had the hope of saving costs and time.

The first mistake made by the iPad Pro owner was, purchasing the LCD screen from a website with poor reviews. The owner thought, they would save more by purchasing a cheap LCD screen. Many of these displays' compatibility, with the iPad device, have issues or are low quality, so it's advisable to buy from a reliable brand that is compatible with the device.

The second mistake was during the process of installation. The owner failed to follow the instructions carefully and thoroughly, which eventually resulted in Touch ID failure. After installation, the LCD screen worked perfectly, but pressing the screen didn't initiate any response.

Aggravated by the touch failure, the owner dismantled the iPad Pro to re-check the installation. It turns out that during the LCD screen installation, they disconnected the digitizer's connection, causing the total touch screen failure.

The iPad Pro's total touch screen failure was a disaster, and the device became completely unusable. After several calls to Apple and repair shops, fixing the device cost significantly more than it initially would have if a professional technician would have carried out the repair.

{{<conclusion>}}

In conclusion, DIY repairs on an iPad Pro might seem like a good idea at first, but it comes with several risks. To avoid a situation like we outlined, it's better to seek professional repairs whenever an iPad Pro develops a fault.

It's also essential to purchase spare parts from a reputable and reliable brand with good and positive reviews to ensure the repair's quality. One crucial lesson from this disaster is that DIY repairs, sometimes, end up costing more than professional repairs.

## Chosen Solution
 I changed a damaged iPad Pro 12.9 digitizer/lcd - the touch on the damaged one still worked when i took it off.  I solder the daughter board to 2 different new display assemblies and neither one have touch that works. The picture displays perfectly fine but i am unable to swipe.
any ideas would be greatly appreciated

 Was there ever a solution to this?  Just ran into the problem myself.  Old screen worked when removed.  New screen worked when first test.  Got adhesive on and tested one list time before setting down and no touch.  Screen image looks perfect, but no touch.  About to resolder old screen to test, but figured I'd check here first.
Update:  Found the problem.  Touch filter had failed from not unplugging the battery before re-assembling.  New filter fixed the issue.  Hope that helps someone else out there.
