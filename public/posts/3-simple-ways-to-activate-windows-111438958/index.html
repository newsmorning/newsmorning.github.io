Windows 11 is the latest operating system developed by Microsoft, and it comes with features that promise to improve productivity, security, and user experience. However, to unlock the full potential of Windows 11, you need to activate it.\nActivation is the process of validating your copy of Windows 11 as genuine and licensed, which allows you to access all the features and updates. Failure to activate Windows 11 may result in legal consequences or restrictions on some functions.\nIn this article, we will discuss three foolproof methods to activate Windows 11, and unlock its incredible features.\nMethod 1: Activate Windows 11 with a Product Key The easiest and most straightforward way to activate Windows 11 is by using a valid product key. A product key is a unique code of 25 characters, which is printed on a sticker or card inside the Windows 11 package, or provided in an email if you purchased the digital version.\nTo activate Windows 11 with a product key, follow these steps:\nGo to Start Menu and click on Settings (gear icon). Click on Update \u0026 Security, then click on Activation. Click on Change product key, then enter the product key and click on Next. Follow the prompts to complete the activation process. If the product key is valid, your copy of Windows 11 will be activated, and you will be able to access all the features and updates. If the product key is not valid, you need to obtain a new one.\nMethod 2: Activate Windows 11 with a Digital License If you upgraded to Windows 11 from Windows 10 or purchased a new device with Windows 11 pre-installed, you may already have a digital license. A digital license is a digital entitlement that allows you to activate Windows 11 without a product key, as it is linked to your hardware configuration.\nTo activate Windows 11 with a digital license, follow these steps:\nGo to Start Menu and click on Settings (gear icon). Click on Update \u0026 Security, then click on Activation. If you have a digital license, it should say “Windows is activated with a digital license” or “Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account.” If you don’t have a digital license, click on Add a Microsoft account, enter your Microsoft account credentials, and follow the prompts to link your digital license to your Microsoft account. If you have a digital license linked to your Microsoft account, you can use it to activate Windows 11 on any device that meets the minimum hardware requirements, without the need for a product key.\nMethod 3: Activate Windows 11 with a Tool If you don’t have a valid product key or a digital license, you can still activate Windows 11 with a tool. A tool is a third-party program that bypasses the activation process and activates Windows 11 using alternative methods.\nHowever, using a tool to activate Windows 11 carries some risks, as it may install malware, compromise your privacy, or violate Microsoft’s terms of service. Therefore, we only recommend this method if you have exhausted all other options, and you trust the tool and its source.\nTo activate Windows 11 with a tool, follow these steps:\nDownload and install a trusted tool, such as KMSpico, Microsoft Toolkit, or KMSPico Portable. Disable your antivirus software and Windows Defender Firewall temporarily. Run the tool as an administrator and click on the Activate button. Wait for the tool to complete the activation process, then restart your device. If the tool works as intended, your copy of Windows 11 will be activated, and you will be able to access all the features and updates. If the tool causes issues or fails to activate Windows 11, you need to uninstall it and seek professional help.\nConclusion Activating Windows 11 is essential to enjoy its incredible features, performance, and security. Whether you have a product key, a digital license, or a tool, there are several foolproof methods to activate Windows 11 and get the most out of it. However, we encourage you to choose the method that suits your needs and preferences while following best practices and security protocols.\nWhen you install Windows 11 on your PC, Microsoft will prompt you to verify that you have a genuine copy of the operating system. Failure to activate Windows 11 means you won’t have access to certain apps, tools, and features of the operating system.\nFor instance, you might be unable to customize the taskbar, change background images/wallpapers, install new themes, or make other customizations to your PC without activating Windows. An “Activate Windows” watermark stays glued to the bottom-left corner of your screen. Windows may also display incessant pop-up messages requesting you to activate the operating system.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll show you how to activate Windows 11 using a product key, digital license, and the Windows Activation troubleshooter.\nHow To Check If Windows 11 is Activated If you didn’t enter a product key right after installing or upgrading to Windows 11, your device is most likely unactivated. You can check your device’s activation status from the Settings app or via Command Prompt.\nCheck Windows Activation Status From the Settings App The Settings app will display a “Windows isn’t activated” message if you’re using an unverified Windows version. You can also confirm your PC’s activation status from the Windows “Activation” menu.\nGo to Settings, select System, and select Activation. Your PC is unactivated if the “Activation state” row displays a Not active error message.\nIf you see an error code and a prompt to enter a product key when you expand the Activation state section, your Windows PC isn’t activated. Check Windows Activation Status via Command Prompt The Command Prompt is an all-around utility for checking your device’s information.\nRight-click the Start menu or press the Windows key + X and select Windows Terminal (Admin) in the Quick Access menu.\nSelect the drop-down icon in the Tab bar and select Command Prompt.\nThat’ll open an elevated Command Prompt console with administrative privileges.\nType or paste slmgr /dli in the console and press Enter. A Windows Script Host window will display a message letting you know if there’s a product key linked to the Windows 11 copy running on your device. Of course, a “product key not found” error message means Windows isn’t activated.\nNow, follow the three methods below in case your Windows 11 installation isn’t activated. 1. Activate Windows 11 Using the Activation Troubleshooter If you upgraded to Windows 11 from a previously activated Windows 10 PC, or you qualify for a free upgrade, you can use the Activation troubleshooter to activate Windows 11 without having to provide a product key or digital license.\nConnect your computer to the internet and follow the steps below.\nOpen the Settings app and select Activate now in the “Windows isn’t activated” notification. Alternatively, head to Settings \u003e System \u003e Activation \u003e Activation state and select the Troubleshoot button to launch the Windows Activation troubleshooter.\nWait for the troubleshooter to diagnose and fix activation-related issues.\nYou’d get a “We’ve activated this copy of Windows” message if the Activation troubleshooter detects a product key and successfully activates your computer.\nSelect Close to exit the troubleshooter. Otherwise, proceed to the next section to activate Windows 11 by manually entering the product key.\n2. How To Activate Windows 11 Using a Product Key Say you have a product key (a 25-character code) and you want to activate your Windows 11 computer. Connect your computer to the internet and follow these steps:\nOpen the Windows Activation menu from Settings \u003e System \u003e Activation—and expand the Activation state section.\nSelect Change in the “Change product key” row.\nEnter the product key in the dialog box and select Enter to proceed.\nSelect Activate to proceed.\nMicrosoft will activate your Windows 11 device if the product key is valid. That’ll remove all restrictions and grant you access to all Windows 11 features.\nIf you purchased Windows 11 but can’t find your product key, visit your Microsoft account’s order history in a browser. We outline other ways to find your Windows product key in this tutorial.\n3. Activate Windows 11 Using a Digital License A digital license (called a “Digital Entitlement” in Windows 11) is basically a digital version of a product key that’s linked to your Microsoft account. It’s a method of activating Windows without having to enter a product key. A digital license or digital entitlement would be the ideal activation method if you:\nBought a Windows 11 or Windows 11 Pro upgrade from the Microsoft Store app.Upgraded to Windows 11 from an eligible Windows device or older Windows version.Upgraded to Windows 11 from a Windows 11 Insider Preview build.Purchase a digital copy of Windows 11 from an authorized retailer. If you don’t have a product key, or your Windows 11 copy is from an unauthorized source, you can purchase a digital license for Windows 11 from Microsoft Store app. Go to Settings \u003e System \u003e Activation and expand the Activation state drop-down and select the Open Store button in the “Get a new license in the Microsoft Store app” row.\nSelect the Buy button and follow the prompt to purchase Windows 11 with a genuine license.\nMake sure the Microsoft Store is linked to your Microsoft account. Tap the profile icon next to the search bar, select Sign in, and provide your account credentials.\nAfter purchasing a Windows 11 license, you should see a “Windows is activated with a digital license” when you check the Windows Activation menu.\nIf Windows still isn’t activated after purchasing the license, restart your PC, connect it to the internet, and check again.\nHow To Deactivate Windows or Uninstall a Product Key Microsoft lets you transfer a retail Windows 11 license between devices. But first, you’ll need to deactivate or remove the product key from one device before using it on another.\nIn Windows 11, you can uninstall a product key by running a command in the Command prompt.\nType or paste slmgr /upk in the console and press Enter. You should get a Windows Script Host message that your device’s product key has been successfully uninstalled.\nNow you can use the product key to activate another Windows 11 device. Read this comprehensive Windows license tutorial to learn more about transferring a Windows 11 license using a product key or your Microsoft account.\nFix Windows 11 Activation Errors Activating Windows 11 is really easy. However, you may get activation-related errors if your copy of Windows 11 is counterfeit or installed on multiple computers. Run the Windows Activation troubleshooter to diagnose the cause of the errors. If the errors persist, check out the troubleshooting solutions in this tutorial on fixing Windows activation errors.\n","wordCount":"1806","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Richard Padilla"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/3-simple-ways-to-activate-windows-111438958/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock Incredible Features: Discover the Top 3 Foolproof Methods to Activate Windows 11 Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 16, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1806 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Richard Padilla</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#method-1-activate-windows-11-with-a-product-key>Method 1: Activate Windows 11 with a Product Key</a></li><li><a href=#method-2-activate-windows-11-with-a-digital-license>Method 2: Activate Windows 11 with a Digital License</a></li><li><a href=#method-3-activate-windows-11-with-a-tool>Method 3: Activate Windows 11 with a Tool</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-check-if-windows-11-is-activated>How To Check If Windows 11 is Activated</a><ul><li></li></ul></li><li><a href=#1-activate-windows-11-using-the-activation-troubleshooter>1.
