The year’s still relatively new and OEMs are still busy releasing new gadgets for their customers. Infinix has launched the battery-centric Infinix Hot 10 Play smartphone in Uganda. The device comes with slightly-improved features compared to the predecessor HOT 9 Play.
 
## What’s New?
 
There’s very little differences between the Infinix Hot 10 Play and its predecessor, the Hot 9 Play. They both have the same 6000mAh battery size, same 13MP rear and 8MP front camera setup, similar 6.82 inch LCD screen, the same 32/64 GB inbuilt storage, and the same Android 10 Go edition.
 
The only difference is that the Hot 9 Play wasn’t launched in Uganda last year and it looks like Infinix slapped the new name Hot 10 Play to an old phone and patched a few things.
 
The chipset and GPU are among the patched-up features. Hot 10 Play packs the 12nm MediaTek Helio G25 chip optimized for games and a better video experience.
 
The phone also has MediaTek HyperEngine Game Technology, which supports an intelligent switch between LTE and Wi-Fi, reduces game lag effectively, making your online phone experience smarter than ever.
 
Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, GPS, USB OTG, Micro-USB, FM radio, 3G, and 4G. Sensors on the phone include an accelerometer, ambient light sensor, compass/ magnetometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, and fingerprint sensor.
