Title: Never Pay Full Price Again: The Ultimate Guide to Saving Money on Uber Rides in Kampala!

Introduction:
Are you tired of spending a fortune on Uber rides in Kampala? Well, you're not alone. Fortunately, there are ways to save money and enjoy the convenience of ride-hailing services. In this article, we'll share some tips and tricks on how to save money on Uber rides in Kampala.

Section 1: Use Promo Codes
Uber often offers promo codes for new and existing users that can be used to get discounts on your rides. You can find promo codes online, on social media, or through Uber's newsletter. Just enter the promo code when you request a ride, and the discount will be applied automatically.

Section 2: Choose the Right Ride
Choosing the right ride can make a big difference in how much you pay for an Uber ride. Uber offers different ride options, such as UberX, UberXL, and UberSELECT, which have varying prices. If you're a solo traveler, UberX is usually the most affordable option. However, if you're traveling with a group, UberXL might be the better choice as it can accommodate up to six passengers.

Section 3: Use Uber Pool
Uber Pool is a shared rides option that allows you to share the ride and split the cost with other passengers going in the same direction. This can be a great way to save money on your Uber ride in Kampala. The downside is that it may take a little longer to reach your destination since there may be additional stops along the way.

Section 4: Choose the Right Pickup and Drop-off Points
The cost of an Uber ride can also depend on the pickup and drop-off locations. If you're traveling to a popular destination, like a mall or airport, the ride may cost more. To save money, choose a nearby location for the pickup and drop-off points. You can also try to avoid peak hours, as prices may be higher during rush hour.

Section 5: Use Uber Rewards and Loyalty Programs
Uber Rewards is a loyalty program that allows you to earn points for every ride you take. These points can be redeemed for rewards such as Uber credits, VIP access to Uber events, and more. Uber also offers other loyalty programs in Kampala, such as Uber for Business and Uber for Commuters.

Conclusion:

One of the biggest challenges for most commuters in Uganda is the hustle of finding timely transportation when they need it most. Uber’s entry into the transport sector was at first met with skeptism but in a relatively short time, it has won hearts and minds. Uber has breathed new life in an archaic and convoluted transport system where drivers hike prices on a whim and passengers are jam-packed in taxis for the sake of making quick profits. No doubt you all have bad experiences about taxis, and if we started with those, we wouldn’t find time to broach the real reason for penning this post.
 
From personal experience, we have observed that Uber provides certain incentives to users. Anybody who takes advantage of these will save on their Uber rides and end up paying far less. Everybody loves a good bargain, better still, when you know the rules. Below are 5 tips to help you save on those Uber rides:
 
## Promo codes
 
Promo codes are an ingenious way to get free rides from Uber. What’s more, both the person using the code you have provided them and yourself get free rides. In Uganda, that amounts to UGX 15,000, which is serious mileage. The free rides keep piling up the more others use your code.
 
## Wait out Uber surge pricing
 
Uber has an interesting if not controversial approach to supply and demand for their services. Uber fares automatically increase when the demand for rides outstrips current supply. Uber’s justification is that this system entices more Uber drivers on the road for the increased fare which in turn lowers the prices. If you don’t mind paying the increased fare, you can go ahead and do just that. If you would rather wait, the Uber app can notify you when the surge pricing goes down. Uber surge pricing usually happens at peak times when everybody is rushing to work, or heading home. On the bright side, it usually doesn’t last for long.
 
## Choose a time with less traffic
 
It goes without saying that picking an Uber at a time when there’s traffic jam will cost you. Apart from the surge pricing, you should realise that the total fare is calculated by distance and time. More time spent in traffic increases your final fare. Rush hours clog up the roads that Uber rides would be insanely expensive. Off-peak hours on the other hand are a breeze. And far cheaper. We would recommend you keep this in mind.
 
## Direct the driver on less used routes
 
Usually, you the passenger would know roads less travelled, if I could borrow the phrase. To request an Uber means you can direct the driver to take alternate routes to your destination, off the main roads. These routes can be shortcuts, or with little or no traffic all which works to reduce the time spent Ubering. Drivers do not always know the best routes to take and a little help would be appreciated.
 
## Fill up those seats, and the boot
 
Finally, as you very well know, most Uber rides are authorised to carry a maximum of 4 passengers. With a minimum fare of UGX 5,000, it wouldn’t make economic sense to Uber solo. If possible, your friends can and should contribute to the fare to reduce on individual cost of the trip. The boot is also another compartment people wouldn’t normally think about. If you have a lot of luggage or go shopping, Uber does not charge extra for your bags.  You are paying for comfort after all.
