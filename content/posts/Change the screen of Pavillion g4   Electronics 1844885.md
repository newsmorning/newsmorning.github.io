# Revamp Your Tech Game: Learn How To Swap Your Pavilion G4 Screen Like A Pro!

Is your Pavilion G4 laptop screen looking old and dilapidated? Do you want to revamp your tech game by swapping the cracked or broken screen like a pro? Then sit back and read on because we have just the right guide for you.

If you are new to device repair, swapping a laptop screen may seem daunting, but it is not rocket science. All you need is a few tools and a little bit of patience, and you'll have your Pavilion G4 screen replaced in no time. 

## Preparations

Before you start, ensure the laptop is turned off and unplugged from the power supply. You will also need a set of screwdrivers, including a Phillips head and a flathead screwdriver, to remove the screws obstructing the screen from coming out. Additionally, you will need a replacement screen that matches the model and size of your laptop. 

Once you have all the necessary equipment and have confirmed the right screen match, you can begin. 

## Removing the Old Screen

Begin by locating the screen's bezel, which is the plastic frame around the screen edges. Use a flathead screwdriver or a plastic pry tool to loosen the bezel's edges, starting from one corner until it pops out of place. You can do this by gently inserting the tool between the bezel and the screen's outer casing, and then prying it gently.

Once you have removed the bezel, the screen will be exposed, and you can see how it is connected to the laptop. Look for the cables and wires that connect the screen to the laptopâ€™s motherboard. Identify and unplug them carefully using your fingers, or use a pair of tweezers.

Next, you can remove the screws that hold the screen in place using a Phillips head screwdriver. There are usually four screws, two on the side and two at the bottom. Gently lift the screen from the frame, and you'll have the old screen removed in no time.

## Installing the New Screen

To install the new screen onto the laptop's frame, align the display's bottom section with the laptop's lower case. Ensure the screen's brackets are flush inside the mount holes, and then insert the screws back using your Philips head screwdriver.

Next, connect the wires and cables to the laptop's motherboard. Be gentle and don't force them in too hard. If the connection is too tight, use a flathead screwdriver to gently nudge the connectors to fit correctly.

Once you are confident that everything is correctly plugged in, you can snap the screen bezel back into place. Press down gently on all edges until it is secure.

## Testing the New Screen

After successfully swapping the screen, it's essential to test whether everything works fine. Turn on the laptop and check that everything is running smoothly. Ensure that the new screen's quality matches the old one and that there is no flickering or distortion.

In a nutshell, swapping a Pavilion G4 screen is not as daunting as it seems, even for beginners. As long as you have the right tools, and you remain careful throughout the process, you can have your laptop's screen replaced like a pro. 

So, ditch the feeling of dread and give it a go. You never know, it might even spark a new hobby in you. Happy fixing!
