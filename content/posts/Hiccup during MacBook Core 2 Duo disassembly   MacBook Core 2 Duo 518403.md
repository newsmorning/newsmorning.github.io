As a tech enthusiast, I am always eager to explore the latest hardware and software in the market. So, when a friend asked me to help him disassemble his old Macbook Core 2 Duo, I jumped at the opportunity. Little did I know what was in store for me.

Things started pretty smoothly, with us following the disassembling instructions step-by-step. We disconnected the battery, removed the screws, disconnected the cables, and everything was going well. But then, we hit a hiccup.

As we tried to separate the case, something was still holding it together. We checked everything twice, even three times, but couldn't figure out what was causing it. It was as if there was an invisible force keeping the case tightly shut.

We went back to the instructions, read them again, and realized we had missed a tiny screw that was concealed under a rubber foot. We swiftly removed it, and the case popped open. But our relief was short-lived.

As we lifted the keyboard, something fell out of it and immediately sizzled out of sight, accompanied by a burning smell. We were stunned, to say the least. What could have caused this?

Upon closer inspection, we realized that a screw had accidentally fallen into the logic board, touching something it shouldn't have. We were now facing a total disaster. One false move, and we could have short-circuited the entire motherboard.

We carefully retrieved the screw, fearful of the damage it had already caused. But to our surprise, everything seemed to be working fine. No visible burns or damage, no strange noises or behavior. It was a miracle.

We reassembled the Macbook, and it booted up without any hiccups. We had gotten lucky. But we learned a valuable lesson that day. Disassembling a Macbook is no easy feat. You need to be cautious, meticulous, and have a lot of patience. One small mistake can lead to catastrophic consequences.

In conclusion, I can say with certainty that the experience of disassembling a Macbook Core 2 Duo was nothing short of unforgettable. It was challenging, stressful, and thrilling, all at the same time. But the biggest lesson we learned that day was to never underestimate the power of a tiny screw.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi.
I've attempted to take my BlackBook apart to clean inside, to no avail. When I follow the guide and remove all of the shown screws, the top-right corner, near the power button, still gets stuck. Why is this? I didn't want to force it open, because this laptop is my baby, but I would really like to get it open and dust around the fan/heatsink.
Thanks!

 If you removed all the screws that are shown in the guide (please doublecheck) it should be quite easy. On the right hand corner (above the optical drive) the topcase is secured by four plastic clamps. Use a stiff plastic card, such as a credit card or similar) and gently lever the case apart. Popping noises are normal during that operation.
PS: Don't take a card that you'll need later. I prefer plastic spatulas, the kind that are sold for cake making. ;-)

 Did you remove the 3 Tiny screws that are in the battery compartment, behind the "L" bracket?  These scres are easy to miss and we're missing from the youtube video I first used to open my machine. Almost broke the topcase because of it.
