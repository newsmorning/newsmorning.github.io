WARNING: Don't Turn On Your Bose Wave Radio Awr1 1W Without Reading This First - CD Player Disaster Looming!

Bose Wave Radio Awr1 1W has been a popular audio system loved by audiophiles for years. It is an all-in-one system that combines a CD player, FM/AM tuner, and alarm clock, providing high-quality audio sound in a compact design. 

However, there is a major issue with the CD player that every owner of Bose Wave Radio Awr1 1W should be aware of. If you're thinking of using the CD player, be warned of the potential problem that awaits as there have been numerous reports of the CD player malfunctioning, resulting in the CD getting stuck, and unable to eject.

It's not that the CD player is a lousy design, but rather it is sensitive to wear and tear over an extended period. The problem usually begins with CDs getting stuck, which gradually worsens until the player refuses to play any CD. This issue may arise even in a well-maintained unit, and it only gets worse with age.

Now, what can you do to avoid such a disaster? Here are some helpful tips:

First, before playing any CD on your Bose Wave Radio Awr1 1W, make sure the CD is of high quality and free of scratches or damages. Don't try to force a damaged CD onto the player, as this will worsen the problem.

Second, take good care of your Bose Wave Radio Awr1 1W, especially the CD player. Cleaning the CD player lens and checking the player belt regularly can help prevent issues.

Third, if your Bose Wave Radio Awr1 1W does start to experience CD player issues, contact Bose customer service for assistance. They will provide you with helpful tips to manage the situation or suggest a service specialist if needed.

In conclusion, the Bose Wave Radio Awr1 1W is still an excellent audio system, but it's essential to be aware of the potential CD player issue that it has. By taking preventive measures, such as handling CDs with care and proper cleaning and inspection of the CD player, you can extend the life of your device and avoid possible malfunctions. If you are experiencing any CD player problems, don't hesitate to contact Bose customer service for assistance.


## Chosen Solution
 I have disassembled the unit so that I can observe the CD player in action.  There were sounds prier to disassembly that were unexplained.  In operation, with observation, the carriage for the laser moves with a threaded shaft.  The purpose is to keep time with the advance of the recorded data.  The whole mechanism is jumping back and forth erratically for a few seconds. Then briefly the CD will work correctly followed by more erratic movement.  Left alone this jerking and momentary playing will continue for thirty to forty minutes.  After this period the CD unit will play normally until the whole unit is turned off for several hours.  Is this a circuit problem or a mechanical problem with the player itself? What would cause either problem.  If it is mechanical, can the CD player be fixed or, if not can I buy a replacement?  If it is a circuit problem, what approach to debug the circuit controlling the CD operation could you suggest?
The Bose is a Model AWRCC1 that plays one CD at a time, reducing the complexity of the player.  Rather than a player that holds several disks and change disks internally.

 Since this unit “works” as expected after a warm-up period,I would first look for any poor solder connections around the motor control IC.  If I recall correctly, there should be two ICs marked BA6209 or BA6219 (most common for units of this vintage) that are the motor drivers.   When playing a CD, there are two movements that take place to provide continual reading of the disc.  First is the lens itself that changes angle to read the track (fine movement) followed by the motor rotating the shaft to physically move the optics assembly (gross movement).  Both of these happen somewhat simultaneously to give a smooth movement overall to read the disc in a spiral fashion.
From what you are describing, the CD system gets lost and the gross movement from one end to the other over the disc is to locate its last position from which it will continue.  This can happen for a few reasons.  I suspect that the gross movement is not controlled correctly which is causing the optics to overshoot the track.  When this happens, the system will “re-calibrate” by going to each extreme  and then locate the correct track.  Since this seems to recover and stop happening once the unit has been working for a while,  either there are poor connections at the control IC or the IC is defective.  Try re-soldering the connections first.  If that does not resolve the problem, replace the driver IC and try again.  Update this with the results.
