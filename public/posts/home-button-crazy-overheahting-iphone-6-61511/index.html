If you have, you’re not alone. Many iPhone 6 users have reported this issue, and the cause of the problem might surprise you.\nFirst, it’s essential to understand that the iPhone 6 home button contains a fingerprint sensor that uses a technology called capacitive touch. The sensor detects the electrical charge in the user’s finger to identify the unique fingerprint and unlock the phone.\nNow, the issue with the home button getting hot is due to the phone’s processor. The iPhone 6 has an A8 chip, which is powerful and efficient, but it can generate a lot of heat when working hard. When the phone’s processor is overclocked, it can cause the home button to heat up.\nOverclocking is a technique of forcing the processor to work at a faster speed than it was designed for, which results in increased performance but also generates more heat. Users who run demanding apps or games that push the processor to its limits may notice the home button heating up.\nIt’s worth noting that the home button’s heating up isn’t necessarily harmful to the device. The iPhone 6 is designed to regulate its temperature, and the device will shut down if it’s getting too hot to prevent any damage.\nHowever, repeated overheating can result in the phone’s battery draining faster than usual and may affect the device’s overall performance.\nIf you’re experiencing the issue of the iPhone 6 home button getting hot, there are a few things you can do to prevent it. Firstly, avoid running multiple apps at the same time, especially processor-intensive ones like games. Secondly, consider closing any apps that you’re not using to free up the phone’s resources.\nFinally, if the issue persists, you can try resetting your device. This clears the phone’s cache and stops any apps from running in the background, cooling down the processor and home button.\nIn conclusion, the iPhone 6 home button getting hot is an issue that’s caused by the phone’s processor overheating due to overclocking. Though it’s not necessarily harmful, it can affect the device’s battery life and performance. By following some simple steps to prevent this problem, you can ensure that your iPhone 6 runs smoothly and efficiently.\nChosen Solution Hi all, After a screen replacement (owner said, phone has a genuie battery replaced a few days before), when touch id is active, home button gets crazy hot. I thought, backplace flex damaged and replaced 3 back-plates, still no success. I have a faulty backplate, when I install it, home button works without touch id and no overheating. What may cause this ? Thanks in advance TNG\nTouch ID or various components that are connected to the touch ID chip on the home button flex are damaged causing a short circuit and heating up. Looks like it’s going to have to have a replacement home button with no touch ID to fix that. That is usually pry damage on the home button flex.\nProblem with iPhones and home button replacements are that they are married to the board which can cause the error 53 code after replacement. If a third-party repair shop replaces the home button and you’re running iOS 9, Apple automatically bricks your phone. Once your iPhone is bricked, there’s no way to unbrick it. This is all pushed as a security issue but the storage for the apple touch id is with a coprocessor and not on the board, icloud, apple database or anything like that. Great in that sense but horrible that 3rd party repair shops are pretty much locked out of doing certain repairs all because of a greedy/poor implemented security function. For hot home buttons, it is a known issue in the Apple community on model 6’s. Many simply recommend a hard reset on the device, I doubt this is your solution but I figured Id add some input into the whole discussion regarding touch id / et al. Thank you Apple for all of your wonderful and innovative designs. /sarcasm/\n","wordCount":"698","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dustin Avila"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-crazy-overheahting-iphone-6-61511/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How Hot Your iPhone 6 Home Button Can Get - Here's Why!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;698 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Dustin Avila</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Hot Your iPhone 6 Home Button Can Get - Here&rsquo;s Why!</p><p>Have you ever experienced your iPhone 6 home button getting hot and causing discomfort while using it?
