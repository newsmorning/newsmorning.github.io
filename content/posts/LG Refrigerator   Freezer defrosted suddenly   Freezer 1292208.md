## Door Opened by Ghost: Fact or Fiction?

Have you ever experienced a door opening on its own and wondered if it was the work of a ghost? The idea of spirits possessing the ability to manipulate physical objects is a common occurrence in ghost folklore. However, is there any real evidence to support the theory that ghosts can open doors?

Many believers in supernatural occurrences will tell you that ghosts are indeed able to open doors. They say that spirits are entities with a certain amount of intelligence and can interact with objects in the physical world. In some instances, they may open doors to get our attention or to communicate a message. On the other hand, skeptics argue that it's simply a matter of natural occurrences like wind, uneven floors or house settling that cause doors to open on their own.

Paranormal researchers have conducted various experiments to find out if there is any truth to the idea of doors being opened by ghosts. Some have gone as far as setting up cameras to record any paranormal activity taking place. Surprisingly, some of these experiments yielded results that suggest an unknown force may be opening doors.

One experiment, conducted by The Atlantic Paranormal Society, involved four stationary infrared cameras set up to capture any paranormal activity in a house. In one instance, they recorded footage of a door opening on its own, without any explanation or natural cause. Another experiment involved a team of ghost hunters using EMF detectors to detect any electromagnetic changes in a room. When a door opened on its own, the EMF detectors picked up a spike in electromagnetic activity in the room.

While some experiments seem to support the idea of ghosts opening doors, there is still a lack of concrete evidence to support these claims. Furthermore, many of these experiments are conducted under controlled conditions that may not represent the environment of many homes or buildings where these phenomena occur.

In conclusion, the idea of a door being opened by a ghost is still a highly debated and mysterious occurrence. While there is some evidence that suggests paranormal entities may be capable of manipulating physical objects, there is still no concrete proof to support this theory. Whether you're a skeptic or believe in the paranormal, it's always best to approach this topic with an open mind and draw your own conclusions based on the evidence at hand.

## Chosen Solution
 LG Fridge:  LSC27926SB, woke up and there was water on the floor. Opened freezer and it was defrosting. Turned temp down to -8 and it seems to be cooling properly now, but I have icicles in my freezer! Why would it suddenly defrost completely?

 Hi @tulls422 ,
Was there a power outage at all?
If not it may be a faulty defrost sensor perhaps. You may have to keep a check on it for a while and see if it occurs again.
Not sure with your model but a lot of LG fridges enter the auto defrost mode once every 8-11 hours. During this time the compressor and the evaporator fan are stopped and the freezer temperature is allowed to rise to 32F (0C) to melt any ice build up on the evaporator unit in the freezer compartment. The ice meltwater drains to the evaporator pan under the cabinet near the compressor. The defrost heater is turned on to help speed up the process as you donâ€™t want any food to even begin to thaw. The whole process takes about 15-25 minutes.
When the freezer temp reaches 32F the defrost sensor signals the control board to turn off the heater and to restart the compressor and the evaporator fan to cool everything back down again to the correct temperatures. This takes a little while to achieve.
