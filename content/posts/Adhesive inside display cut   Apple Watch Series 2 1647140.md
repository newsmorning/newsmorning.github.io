Title: SHOCKING! Apple Watch Series 2 RECALL - Adhesive Inside Display Cut Could Be HARMFUL!

In September 2018, Apple issued a voluntary recall of an estimated 90,000 Apple Watch Series 2 devices due to a potentially dangerous issue. It was discovered that in some instances, the adhesive in the watch's display could become loose and cause the screen to crack or detach completely. If the fractured glass onto which it was adhered comes into contact with a body part or clothing, it could potentially cause injury.

While the recall is a disappointing reflection on the Apple Watch series 2, it is a reminder that even the best tech products can experience dangerous malfunctions. The recall urges that customers with affected watches contact Apple or take it to an authorized repair center for a free replacement or repair.

If you have an Apple Watch Series 2 that you believe might be affected, there are a few things you should be aware of. The first is that it is not safe to continue wearing the watch, even if the display isn't cracked. The adhesive within the display cut can become loose without warning, and if your watch is affected, you should stop wearing it immediately.

The next is that you will need to contact Apple or an authorized repair center to get an official diagnosis of your watch's condition. Apple has stated that watches will be evaluated free of charge to determine whether they are affected and eligible for a free repair or replacement.

Lastly, it is important to note that this recall only affects the Apple Watch Series 2, which was released in 2016. The newer models and the original Apple Watch are not affected by this particular issue.

If you have an Apple Watch Series 2, it is important to be aware of this recall and to take appropriate action if your watch is affected. While technology is constantly evolving and improving, safety should always come first, and it is good to see Apple taking swift and responsible action to address this issue.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, unfortunately while changing the battery of my watch, I destroyed the bridge of the adhesive (with copper underneath) between the middle ‚Äúisland‚Äù and the right ‚Äúisland‚Äù.  It should be connected like the left ‚Äúisland‚Äù. Hope someone understands and sees what I mean. Please see my photo.
Now,  with the new battery, I cannot start the watch. The Apple symbol pops up for a few seconds, but nothing happens. Is this destroyed bridge the reason?
How can I repair the connection or get a spare part?
Thanks so much!

 The copper adhesive strip is an EMI shield it doesn't effect the running on the watch. But the lifted edge could be pressing on the battery so I would use a jewelers burnisher to carefully press the edge down.

 Well, the battery was just ordered from ifixit. üòâ
