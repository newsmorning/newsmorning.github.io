+++

As a tech enthusiast, I've always been interested in learning how to repair electronic devices. So, when the motherboard of my Samsung Galaxy S6 suddenly died, I decided to take matters into my own hands and replace it myself.

I ordered a replacement motherboard online and eagerly waited for it to arrive. When it finally did arrive, I watched countless YouTube tutorials and read several online guides on how to replace the motherboard. I was confident that I could do it, and I started the process.

Everything seemed fine at first. I carefully removed the back cover of my phone and disconnected all the cables and connectors. I then removed the old motherboard and installed the new one. The process was time-consuming, but I was determined to get my phone up and running again.

Finally, after several hours of work, I was ready to put everything back together. I connected all the cables and connectors and carefully placed the back cover back on. I then turned on the phone, and that's when the disaster struck.

The phone turned on, but the screen was completely black. I could hear sounds and vibrations, but the display was completely dead. I tried everything I could think of - I disconnected and reconnected all the cables, I reset the phone, and I even tried to install the old motherboard back to see if that would work. But nothing worked.

I was devastated. Not only had I wasted hours of my time, but I had also potentially ruined my phone. I searched online for solutions and found out that it could be a problem with the display assembly or a damaged cable.

Feeling defeated, I took my phone to a professional repair shop to see if they could fix it. The technician quickly diagnosed the problem and informed me that I had damaged the display assembly while trying to replace the motherboard. I was shocked - I had been so careful!

The repair cost me twice the amount of the replacement motherboard, and I learned a valuable lesson: sometimes, it's better to leave the repair work to the professionals. As much as I value the experience I gained from attempting to fix my phone myself, I now regret not taking it to a professional in the first place.

In conclusion, attempting to replace the motherboard of my Samsung Galaxy S6 was a disaster. Despite all my research and preparation, I ended up causing more damage to my phone. I learned that sometimes, it's better to leave technology repairs to the professionals.

 Hi Guys , I changed out main motherboard from my Canadian S6 to a AT&T american board . I get signal and everything but cannot place a call, i figure it is because it is a USA board . Any ideas how to make this work or am I SOL ?
