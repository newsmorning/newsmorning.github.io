Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Fix Your Vintage Cuisinart Food Processor With This Simple Safety Switch Repair Guide!

Introduction:

Your vintage Cuisinart food processor has been an essential kitchen gadget for years, but recently, you might have noticed that it's not working as well as it used to. One of the most common problems with these food processors is the safety switch; it's a small but essential part that ensures your machine won't operate if the lid isn't securely locked in place. Fortunately, fixing this issue is a lot easier than you might think.

Step 1: Getting Started

Firstly, ensure that your food processor is switched off and unplugged from the wall. Then, remove the elements that cover the switch. This may differ depending on the model, but it's usually a plastic cover held in place with screws.

Step 2: Inspect The Safety Switch

Once you've removed the cover, inspect the safety switch. Check to see if the black or white tab that connects it to the lid is in good condition. If it's damaged or missing, you'll need to order a replacement.

Step 3: The Quick Fix

If the tab is in good condition, you can attempt a quick fix for the switch. In some cases, the switch only needs to be repositioned for it to work correctly. Check the switch and ensure it's correctly connected and that there are no loose connections.

Then, push down on the switch button with your finger; if it operates smoothly, your problem is likely solved. If not, you'll need to replace the switch.

Step 4: Replacing The Safety Switch 

To replace the safety switch, you'll need to remove the wire connectors that connect the switch to the motor. You can do this by using a pair of wire strippers. Trim the wire end and remove the connectors with pliers.

After that, unscrew the switch from its mounting and remove it from the food processor. Then, reattach the new switch and reassemble the elements.

Step 5: Testing 

With the new switch in position, test the food processor by plugging it in and turning it on. Ensure everything is operating correctly and that it doesn't run unless the lid is secured.

Conclusion:

Fixing a vintage Cuisinart food processor's safety switch is not as complicated as it may seem. With a few simple steps, and a replacement part if necessary, your food processor will be back to working like new. Don't let a faulty safety switch keep you from using your favorite kitchen gadget. Take a few moments to follow this easy guide and enjoy your perfectly working food processor once again!

Step 1

                  Safety Switch Problem               


 
- 
 - You can see the spring loaded mechanism in the bowl handle that pushes the switch through a hole in the base, this allows you to turn it on. My switch had dropped down inside the unit so that the mechanism could not push it enough to activate it. This keeps the unit from working.

Step 2

                  Removing the bottom cover               


 
- 
 - Remove the bowl and flip the base upside down putting the center shaft through the tube in the bowl.
 - 
 - Now peel off the rubber feet to reveal the screw holes holding the top and bottom covers together. Unscrew those 4 screws under the feet with a #2 Phillips screwdriver. One of my screws was just spinning because the part it attached to in the top cover had broken off.

Step 3

                  Safety Switch Inspection               


 
- 
 - Remove the bottom cover & look inside of the top cover for the safety microswitch. If your switch is like mine it came loose because the screw attachment locations on the top cover broke loose and came off. With no way to get a new top cover the only way to fix it right is  to reattach the switch to its original location using small machine screws.

Step 4

                  Parts you need               


 
- 
 - I got 2 - 1 inch long #6 flathead stainless steel screws with nylon lock nuts to fasten the safety switch back to the top cover in the right place. I also got two 1/4' nylon spacers to go between the switch housing and the top cover to replace the  pieces that broke off.

Step 5

                  Drilling               


 
- 
 - Next I used a drill bit that was as close to the size of the screws and drilled through the top cover where the previous screws used to attach. Be careful that you don't drill into the bowl when you are doing this.
 - 
 - Then I used a bigger drill bit on the top of the top cover to countersink the screw heads into the top of the top cover since there is a close clearance when putting the bowl on. Be gentle with the drilling since the old plastic is really brittle.
 - 
 - If I had it to do over again I might try to rotate the safety switch so that the one screw would both be farther away from where the bowl goes. (The cracks in the top cover were there before I started working on it!)

Step 6

                  Prep for attaching the switch               


 
- 
 - Once you have drilled and drilled to countersink the screw heads, it's time to put it together. Run both screws through the top and then put the 1/4 inch nylon spacers on the screws.
 - 
 - Now put the rubber seal in the top cover. Next the nylon plunger goes in the rubber seal with the big side down. Last the spring goes around the nylon plunger. Small side down.

                  Attaching the Safety switch               


 
- 
 - Next put the switch housing over the seal plunger spring assembly and put the lock nuts on the screws and gently tighten. Make sure you don't crack the top case by tightening too tight!

Step 8

                  Testing               


 
- 
 - I would not screw the bottom cover down until you test it to make sure it works. Now flip the unit over and place it on the black bottom cover. Make sure you put the bowl and the top pice on and rotated to the right! If you don't do this then it will not work. Then test to see if it's working.

Step 9

                  Gluing the feet to the bottom               


 
- 
 - The last step is to glue the rubber feet back on the bottom with some rubber cement.
