Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to This iPad After a Digitizer Repair - A Terrifying Blank Screen!

Introduction:

When an electronic device such as an iPad needs a repair, it's always a relieving feeling to hand it over to the technician and wait for it to come back looking and functioning as good as new. But sometimes, things don't go as planned, and you end up with a result that leaves you more worried and stressed than before. This is precisely what happened to me after a digitizer repair on my iPad. In this article, I will recount my experience and what led to the terrifying blank screen that left me shocked.

Body:

I had been using my iPad for a little over a year when the screen cracked after an accidental fall. I immediately took it to the nearest repair shop, which had high ratings online and promised to fix the device within two days. The technician replaced the damaged digitizer and showed me that the iPad was working fine. I was happy to have my gadget back and thanked the technician before leaving.

However, the next morning was when the real shocker unfolded. I picked up my iPad, excited to use it again, only to find that the screen had gone blank. No amount of pressing the power or home button would turn it on. I panicked and feared that the repair work had somehow caused a hardware error or some other significant damage. I immediately contacted the repair shop and explained what had happened.

The technician asked me to bring the iPad back to the shop for an inspection, and I complied. After some basic diagnostics, he declared that the iPad was fine but needed a complete software restore. He assured me that all my saved data would not be lost and that the process would take a maximum of three hours. I left my iPad at the shop and crossed my fingers for a positive outcome.

After waiting for close to four hours, I received a call from the technician who told me that the iPad was ready for collection. I rushed to the shop and was relieved to see that the screen had come back to life. The technician explained that the cause of the blank screen was most likely due to an incomplete firmware update, which he had now fixed. I was grateful to have my gadget back, but the whole ordeal left me wondering how such a simple repair could have gone so wrong.

Conclusion:

In my experience, the digitizer repair on my iPad turned out to be a nightmare. The blank screen episode was terrifying, and I couldn't help but think of the possibility of losing precious data. However, I was fortunate to have taken the iPad back to the technician who rectified the problem in a matter of hours. It's important to note that some repairs that seem simple could potentially turn into a nightmare if not handled appropriately. It's therefore recommended to choose a repair shop carefully and ensure that they have a good track record. Trusting one's gadget to a technician is a big deal, and it's crucial to walk away with a sense of security and satisfaction.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the digitizer on my  iPad 5th Generation , A1822.  When I went to test before closing it up I noticed the screen was blank and would not display anything.  I could see it was slightly dark blue so not completely black but it has backlight.  After multiple soft resets and multiple hard reset nothing worked.  I plugged it in and removed the power supply with no difference.  I did this while attempting the various two types of resets.
I reinstalled the old hardware and was shocked when the screen turned on.  I proceeded to uninstall the broken hardware and reinstalled the new digitizer.  The same thing occurred nothing on the screen with the screen displaying the dark green.  I assume this is the back light being turned on.  Each time I made sure the battery was not connected to not cause any high amp damage.
A bit confused about what to do next.

 With the new screen connected try pressing the home and power buttons together for 30 to 40 seconds. If apple logo appears then let go.
