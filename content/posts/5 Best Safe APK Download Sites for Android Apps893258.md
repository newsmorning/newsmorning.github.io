A lot of the apps you’ll find on the Google Play Store are free, but not all. Sometimes, in the case of those with a jailbroken Android device or emulator like MEmu or Bluestacks, you may prefer to get those apps for free. In this case, you’d need to download an app in .APK format.
 
We’re going to talk about what an APK file is and the best, safe APK sites. From these sites, it’s easy to download APK files to install any android app you want for free.
 
## 5 Best Safe APK Download Sites for Android Apps
 
APK stands for Android Package Kit, and is used for the distribution of Google Android applications. They’re saved in a .ZIP file format and are usually downloadable directly into the Android device.
 

 
There are plenty of options out there for APK sites but not all of them are safe and trustworthy. A little bit of research, which we’ve done for you, has nabbed us 5 different safe APK sites we suggest for APK downloading.
 
### APKMirror

### BlackMart Alpha
