Is Your Toyota Corolla in Danger? Shocking News Reveals High Beams Won't Turn On!

Toyota Corolla has been a top-selling compact car in America for years. It is a reliable, fuel-efficient vehicle that offers good value for money. However, recent reports have revealed a potentially hazardous issue that affects some Toyota Corolla models. High beams won't turn on. This issue could compromise the safety of drivers, passengers, and other people on the road. 

According to reports, the problem affects 2019-2021 Toyota Corolla models equipped with LED headlights. Drivers may find that the high beams do not turn on or turn off after a short while. This issue can cause a major hazard, especially on poorly-lit roads or in bad weather conditions. High beams provide better visibility and make it easier to see the road ahead. Without them, drivers may not be able to react to hazards in time, increasing the risk of an accident. 

Toyota has yet to identify the root cause of the problem, but have issued a recall for the affected models. The recall began in February 2021 and will cover about 158,000 vehicles in the United States. Toyota dealerships will inspect and replace the headlight circuits, if necessary, free of charge. Toyota will be sending letters to customers to advise them about the recall and the necessary actions to be taken. 

If you own a 2019-2021 Toyota Corolla with LED headlights, it is essential to check whether your vehicle is included in the recall. You can visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website to check whether your VIN is part of the recall. It is important not to ignore the issue, even if you have not noticed any problems with your headlights, as it could affect your safety while driving. 

In conclusion, the recent news about high beams not turning on in some Toyota Corolla models is alarming. Driving without high beams can be dangerous, especially in poor light conditions or inclement weather. It is important to check whether your vehicle is part of the recall and take appropriate action if necessary. As Toyota works to remedy this issue, it is critical to prioritize driver and passenger safety by staying informed, checking your vehicle's status, and ensuring corrective measures are taken.

## Chosen Solution
 2005 corolla, High beam will not activate when the switch is placed in the high beam position. The indicator light on the dash does not activate either. When the switch is placed in the temporary high beam position, the headlights and the light on the dash work properly.  The low beams work properly. I have replaced the switch on the column, checked all relays and fuses and bulbs, everything is working properly. What should I do next?
Update (10/22/2019)
I have already replaced the dimmer relay. That did not fix the

 @greyghost1968 since you already changed the switch etc. the only thing left is really your relay. Of course that assumes that you checked all the connectors to ensure they are in good working order (no corrosion etc.) Maybe instead of checking it try to replace it.

 When you manually Flash to Pass you are manually providing a ground for the high beams and the indicator. When you push into high beams, the Dimmer Relay is doing the work through the Daytime Running Lights Relay assembly which may also be your problem. Swap the dimmer relay with a different, same style, relay to test that part.
