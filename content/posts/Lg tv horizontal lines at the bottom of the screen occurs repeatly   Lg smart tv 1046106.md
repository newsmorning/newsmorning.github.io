If you're an LG smart TV user, you might have noticed constant horizontal lines at the bottom of your screen. At first, you might think it's a hardware issue, but it turns out that it's something much more sinister.

The real culprit behind these lines is a little-known feature called TruMotion. TruMotion is designed to enhance the motion quality of your TV by smoothing out fast-moving footage. However, it's also the cause of those pesky horizontal lines.

You might be wondering how TruMotion is causing these lines. TruMotion works by creating interim frames that are inserted between the actual frames of the footage. These interim frames are created by analyzing the two adjacent frames and using that information to create a new frame that lies between them.

This process can cause horizontal lines because of the way some TVs display images. Most TVs display images using a process called interlacing, which splits each frame into two fields that are displayed one after the other. When TruMotion is turned on, the interim frames can cause the fields to become misaligned, resulting in those annoying lines at the bottom of the screen.

Thankfully, there's an easy fix for this problem. The first thing you need to do is turn off TruMotion. This will prevent the TV from creating the interim frames that are causing the lines. You can do this by going to the Picture settings and turning off the TruMotion feature.

If you still notice the lines after turning off TruMotion, then you'll need to adjust the Picture settings manually. First, switch your TV's Picture Mode to Standard. This will give you a more natural picture and reduce the likelihood of horizontal lines.

Next, adjust the TV's Picture settings to reduce the sharpness and increase the brightness. This will help to reduce the lines by making the image less defined and more uniform across the screen.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing constant horizontal lines at the bottom of your LG smart TV's screen, don't panic. It's most likely caused by the TruMotion feature. Turn it off, adjust your Picture settings, and you'll have a clear, crisp image that's free from those pesky lines.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,  i have lg lm660s 42 inch tv. I bought it in late 2013. Recently, about 30 minutes after turning on the TV, lines appear in the lower half of the screen at five-second intervals. the part where the lines come out slides slightly upwards and vibrates. I want to know if it can be repaired. What could be the source of the problem? I am attaching a short video about the problem below. thank you.
