# Revive Your 3D Printer in Minutes: The Ultimate 7-Step Guide to Fix Your X Carriage Assembly!

A 3D printer is a powerful and versatile tool that can make almost anything, from toys to prosthetics, and opens a world of possibilities for makers and designers. But like any piece of machinery, it can break down or function poorly over time, especially if it is frequently used or subjected to wear and tear.

One of the most common issues that can affect a 3D printer is a malfunctioning X carriage assembly. The X carriage, also known as the X-axis, is the part of the printer that moves left and right along the frame while the extruder deposits filament to create the layers of the object being printed. When the X carriage assembly is not working correctly, the printer may skip or stutter, resulting in uneven or flawed prints.

Fortunately, fixing the X carriage assembly is easier than you might think. With a few basic tools and some patience, you can revive your 3D printer in minutes and get back to creating high-quality prints. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

## Step 1: Turn off the power

Before you start working on your printer, make sure it is turned off and unplugged from the wall socket. This will prevent any electrical accidents or damage to the printer's internal components.

## Step 2: Remove the print bed

To access the X carriage assembly, you'll need to remove the print bed from the printer's frame. Depending on your model of printer, this may involve unscrewing some bolts or clips that secure the bed in place. Be careful not to damage the print bed or any of the other components while removing it.

## Step 3: Remove the X carriage assembly

Next, you'll need to remove the X carriage assembly from the printer's frame. This is usually held in place by some screws or bolts that you'll need to remove using a hex wrench or similar tool. Again, be careful not to damage any of the components while removing the X carriage assembly.

## Step 4: Check the bearings and rods

Now that you have the X carriage assembly removed, you can check the bearings and rods that support it. These are often the cause of issues with the X carriage assembly, as they can become misaligned or worn over time. Check each bearing and rod carefully, and see if any appear damaged or misaligned. If so, you may need to replace them.

## Step 5: Clean the carriage

While you have the X carriage assembly removed, it's a good idea to clean it thoroughly. Use a soft cloth or brush to remove any dirt, debris, or filament residue that has accumulated on the carriage. This will help ensure smooth and accurate movement of the printer's extruder during printing.

## Step 6: Reassemble the X carriage

Once you've checked the bearings and rods and cleaned the carriage, you can reassemble the X carriage assembly. Make sure to attach it securely to the printer's frame using the screws or bolts that you removed earlier.

## Step 7: Test the printer

Finally, you can test the printer to ensure that the X carriage assembly is working correctly. Turn on the printer and run a test print, preferably a simple model with a few layers. Watch the X carriage assembly closely as it moves back and forth along the frame, and listen for any strange noises or vibrations. If you notice any issues, go back and recheck the bearings and rods to ensure they are properly aligned.

By following these seven simple steps, you can revive your 3D printer's X carriage assembly in just a few minutes and get back to creating high-quality prints. Remember to perform regular maintenance on your printer, including checking the bearings and rods, cleaning the carriage, and lubricating any moving parts, to prevent future issues from developing. Happy printing!

## Introduction
 
1x X Carriage Wire Tube Holder.stl
 
1x X carriage shield for the metal kit.stl
 
One of the following:
 
1x Metal kit - BLtouch adapter.stl
 
1x BLTouch Front Mount Adapter.stl
 
## What you need
 
## 

Step 1

                  E3D V6 Mount               


 
- 
 - Using 2x M3x8 socket head screws mount the V6 Front Plate Mount to the front Plate.
 - 
 - Make sure it's level otherwise you will have inconsistent nozzle height.
 - 
 - Make sure the screws are tight. I've had these screws loosen up on me after 2 weeks.

Step 2

                  X Endstop and BLTouch               


 
- 
 - Using 2x M2 washers and 2x M2x8 button head screws mount the X Endstop on the rear late above the upper belt. Make sure the endstop lever is facing down
 - 
 - At this time, the endstop has all 3 wires connected. You will not have any reason to use the middle wire and if connected wrong it can short the endstop plug shutting off the printer. Since we don't need it, cut the red wire and discard
 - 
 - The original design has the BLTouch mounted on the rear of the carriage using 2x M3x6 button head screws to secure the mount to the Rear Plate.
 - 
 - Secure the BLTouch to the rear mount with 2x M3x8 button head screws and 2x M3 nuts
 - 
 - I have designed an optional variant that moves the BLTouch to the front of the X Carriage. You can find the files in the FYSETC Modified Printed Parts folder on my Github
 - 
 - Secure the mount to the Front Plate with 2x M3x6 button head screws
 - 
 - Secure the BLTouch to the Front Mount with 2x M3x10 button head screws and 2x M3 nuts

Step 3

                  Alternative BLTouch Mount Notice               


 
- 
 - If using my BLTouch mount, the BLTouch will hit the X carriage before the endstop is triggered. To remedy this thread in a M2x8 socket head cap into the outside threaded hole on the Left X Mount.
 - 
 - The screw needs to protrude out the opposite side enough to trigger the endstop before the BLTouch mount hits. About 2-3mm

Step 4

                  Hotend               


 
- 
 - Insert the Thermistor into the heat block and tighten the small set screw
 - 
 - Insert the heater cartridge into the heat block and tighten the M3 button head screw.
 - 
 - Install the silicone sock onto the heat block.
 - 
 - Using 2x M3x16 socket head screws secure the E3D and the E3D V6 Locker to the front plate.
 - 
 - While tightening the screws make sure the hotend stays straight. If it moves left or right, remove the hotend and tighten the screws for the V6 Front Plate Mount from step 1.
 - 
 - Make sure the thermistor and heater wires are to the left the hotend. This will prevent any wires from getting in the way of the X Endstop.

Step 5

                  Block Shield               


 
- 
 - At the time of writing this the kit contains a single 5015 radial fan. It's been found that it provides insufficient cooling and is no official mounts have been released for the metal kit. FYSETC has been made aware and in the process of upgrading the kits with dual 4010 Blower fans
 - 
 - Mount the 4010 fan with the longest wire into the block shield with 4x M3x12 screws
 - 
 - Insert the 2 blowers into the side mounts and secure with 2x M2.5x6 socket head screws(top) and 2x M2.5x12 socket head screws(bottom) on both sides.
 - 
 - Secure the block shield to the X Carriage with 5x M3x8 button head screws. Don't forget about the screw on the front.

Step 6

                  Hotend Wiring               


 
- 
 - Wiring is really a personal preference but I like everything as neat as possible which is why I made a wire locker mount for the metal kit. You can find the files in the FYSETC Modified Printed Parts folder on my Github
 - 
 - Note-This will not work if you have the BLTouch on the rear of the carriage
 - 
 - Using 2x M3x6 button head screws and 1x M3x10 button head screw mount the Wire Locker to the Rear Plate
 - 
 - Insert the hotend wires into the wire loom.
 - 
 - If you have a 24" zip-tie insert it into the wire loom with the wires(not included with the kit). This will help keep the wire loom up
 - 
 - Using a small zip-tie, lock the wire loom into the wire locker
