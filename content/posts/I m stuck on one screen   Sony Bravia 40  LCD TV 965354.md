Is Your Sony Bravia 40 LCD TV Acting Up? Discover Why Users Everywhere Are Getting Stuck on One Screen!

---

If you own a Sony Bravia 40 LCD TV and are experiencing issues with getting stuck on one screen, you’re not alone. Users across the world are facing the same problem, leaving them frustrated and unable to watch their favorite programs or movies.

One possible reason for this issue is a software glitch. Many Sony Bravia 40 LCD TVs run on Android TV operating systems, which are prone to glitches and bugs. These bugs can cause the TV to freeze, crash, or get stuck on one screen.

Another reason could be an issue with the internet connection. If the Wi-Fi signal is weak or unstable, the TV may not be able to stream content smoothly. This can cause the TV to get stuck on one screen, or display a buffering icon endlessly.

Additionally, compatibility issues between the TV and the content being streamed can also cause the TV to get stuck. The TV may not be able to play certain codecs, and therefore, not display the content correctly.

So, what can you do if your Sony Bravia 40 LCD TV is acting up? Here are some steps you can take to fix the issue:

1. Restart your TV:
Sometimes a simple restart is all that’s needed to fix the problem. Turn off the TV, unplug it from the power source, and wait for a few minutes before plugging it back in and turning it on.

2. Check your Wi-Fi signal:
If the issue persists, check your Wi-Fi signal strength. Try switching to a different Wi-Fi network or connecting the TV using a wired connection instead.

3. Update the TV software:
Check for any available software updates for your Sony Bravia 40 LCD TV. Updating the software can fix bugs and glitches that may be causing the issue.

4. Contact Sony customer support:
If none of the above steps work, it may be time to contact Sony customer support. They can walk you through additional troubleshooting steps or advise you on the next best course of action.

In conclusion, if your Sony Bravia 40 LCD TV is acting up, there could be several reasons for the issue. Try the steps above to fix the issue before contacting customer support. Remember, patience and persistence can go a long way in resolving these types of technical difficulties.

## Chosen Solution
 I’m stuck on this one screen on my Sony Bravia KDL 40 WE663 which I cannot get out of by pressing any button on my remote.  The remote is working apparently.  The screen has APPS + CHANNELS + RECORDINGS + MEDIA + SETTINGS + HOME SCREEN.  None of these work.  Is there a hidden button?   I cannot get out by pressing ‘Home’ or ‘Return’.  It’s driving me nuts and yes I have switched it off and restarted it.  Thanks anybody in advance, James

 How to factory reset if you cannot operate the home menu screen with the remote control(from Sony's website):
Unplug the TV power cord from the electrical outlet and leave it unplugged for about a minute.Plug the TV back in. It should come on automatically. If it doesn't, press the power button on the TV.Wait about 40 seconds for the TV to completely start up.Point the remote control at the TV. Press and hold the up arrow button.The TV should restart.While holding the up arrow button on the remote control, press and release the power button on the TV. You should see “Reset” appear in the upper left hand corner of the TV..Release the up arrow button.You should now see the initial aetup screen.
