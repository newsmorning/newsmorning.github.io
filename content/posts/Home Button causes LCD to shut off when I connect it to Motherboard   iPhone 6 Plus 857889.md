# WARNING! Connecting Home Button to iPhone 6 Plus Motherboard Could Damage Your LCD Screen!

When it comes to repairing an iPhone, it's important to follow the proper procedures to avoid damaging your device. One area that requires extra care is the home button. If you attempt to connect the home button to your iPhone 6 Plus motherboard without taking proper precautions, you could end up damaging your LCD screen.

# Understanding the Problem

The iPhone 6 Plus home button is an important component of the device. It functions as a fingerprint scanner and is used to navigate the phone's interface. In some cases, the home button may malfunction, requiring repair or replacement.

When replacing the home button on an iPhone 6 Plus, it's essential to understand how the component connects to the motherboard. The connector on the home button flex cable can cause damage to the LCD screen if not handled properly.

# The Risk of Damage

When attaching the home button to the motherboard, there is a potential risk of damaging the LCD screen. The small metal connector on the home button flex cable can easily scratch or crack the display.

Even slight pressure or misalignment of the connector can damage the LCD. Given the high cost of replacing an iPhone 6 Plus screen, it's important to take all necessary precautions when replacing the home button.

# Preventing Damage

There are several steps you can take to avoid damaging your iPhone 6 Plus LCD screen when replacing the home button. These include:

- Use a small spudger or tweezers to maneuver the home button into place.
- Be gentle and take your time during the repair process.
- Don't apply excessive force when connecting the home button flex cable to the motherboard.
- Inspect the connector and the LCD screen for any signs of damage before reassembling the phone.

By taking these precautions, you can reduce the risk of damaging your iPhone 6 Plus LCD screen when replacing the home button.

# Conclusion

Replacing the home button on an iPhone 6 Plus can be a tricky repair job. If you don't take the necessary precautions, you can easily damage the device's LCD screen.

If you're not comfortable performing this repair yourself, it's always best to consult a professional. A qualified repair technician can ensure that your iPhone is repaired correctly and safely, without the risk of further damage.

Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to repairing your iPhone 6 Plus. By taking care and being cautious, you can keep your phone in top shape for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently got a 6 Plus, i replaced the Digitizer and Lcd,everything was fine. Now it seems to have a home button issue. the actual home button was fine and salvaged perfectly, but the ribbon cable that connects to the home button was broken. I ordered a replacement backplate shield with ribbon cable attached it seemed to be pinched(at the top of the shield where the ribbon comes out to plug into the board when i got it) I installed it to see if it would make any difference. The touch id does not work which is not my issue(It is the original home button, not original backplate and ribbon) Everything seemed to be working normally for a couple hours, until i noticed a bright spot on the top right corner of the screen, so to be safe i took the phone apart to see if i could notice anything out of the ordinary;which i cant. THE PROBLEM IS- when i went to put together my phone the lcd will only come on if i leave the home button unplugged, if i plug it into the motherboard the screen will not come on.I checked for anything behind the back plate and found nothing, so i closed it up and put it back together.   .....ps if leave the home button disconnected the phone starts normally but have no access to home button since its not plugged in. When the home button is connected the LCD will stay black, and cant be fixed in recovery mode, it gives me "error 4014"Any ideas what this could be? THANKS

 Change the faulty flex that you've used on the phone, it was pinched when you got it you then probably straightened it and then adjusted it more to get rid of the pressure mark so it's been over stressed change the flex to another one... if the touchid worked and the home button wasn't damaged then a good quality flex should make both the button and the touchid work :)
