Is Your Acer Iconia Tab Not Charging? Here's the Shocking Reason Behind It!

The Acer Iconia Tab is an excellent device for both personal and professional use. With its sleek design, powerful hardware, and user-friendly interface, it's no wonder that it has become one of the most sought-after tablets in the market today. However, despite its many features and capabilities, some users have experienced issues with their Acer Iconia Tab not charging. This can be a frustrating problem, especially if you need your device to be fully charged for work or leisure. But what exactly causes this issue? And what can you do about it?

The Shocking Reason Behind It

The most common reason why your Acer Iconia Tab is not charging is because of a faulty charging port. The charging port is the part of the device where the USB cable is connected, which allows the device to charge. Over time, the charging port can become damaged from repeated use or due to dust and other debris that accumulate over time. When the charging port is damaged, it can no longer connect to the USB cable, and the device won't charge.

Another factor that can cause your Acer Iconia Tab not to charge is a faulty charging cable. The USB cable that comes with the device can also become damaged over time, especially if it is used frequently. If the USB cable is faulty, it may not be able to send power to the device, resulting in a failure to charge.

What Can You Do About It?

The good news is that there are several things you can do to fix your Acer Iconia Tab charging problem. The first thing you can do is to try using a different charging cable. If the problem is due to a faulty cable, this should resolve the issue.

However, if the problem persists, you may need to replace the charging port. You can do this by either taking your device to an authorized Acer repair center or by using a DIY charging port replacement kit. If you choose to replace the charging port yourself, make sure to follow the instructions carefully and use the appropriate tools. Be aware that attempting to replace the charging port yourself may void your device warranty.

Conclusion

If your Acer Iconia Tab is not charging, it can be frustrating, but there are ways to fix the problem. From trying a different charging cable to replacing the charging port, several solutions can help you get your device charging properly again. Always remember to follow the instructions carefully if you decide to replace the charging port yourself, and be sure to use appropriate tools. With the right steps and care, you'll be able to get your Acer Iconia Tab charging again in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 My tablet now discharges when I plug it in.... it's not the cable or plug, I tried them on my other devices...  Could it be the table t itself?
It's about 2 years old

 mnmmacd, since you already checked the cable and charger it is most likely your tablet. Possibly the charging port or the battery. You will have to open it up and check the condition of the port. Make sure it is still properly soldered on and that there are no solder fractures. While you have it open, replace the battery as well. Your tablet should be very similar to open than the A1-810.

 my sisters A1-811 just stopped charging recently, battery was totally drained too.
what i did was open it, i used my nail actually after watching a useful video on youtube, then just made sure the connections were in firmly (disconnected n reconnected the battery cable), and THEN i connected the tab to power, i think its the USB port thats messed coz it starts charging wen the cable is barely inside, like just wen it contacts the metal on the tablet...

 REPLACE For ACER ICONIA A1-810 A1-811 MICRO USB DC POWER JACK PORT 48.4VL21.011 this is the only option. buy this unit at ebay and replace it. 2 screws and that's it.
