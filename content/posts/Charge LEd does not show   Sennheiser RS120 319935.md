You'll Never Guess Why Your Sennheiser RS120's Charge LED Isn't Working - Shocking Truth Revealed!

Are you having trouble with your Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones? Do you notice that the charge LED isn't working or doesn't turn on when you put your headphones on the charging dock or plug the charger in? Do you have to guess when your headphones are charged, and then check the battery level when your music stops? If you answered yes to these questions, you're not alone! This is an issue that many Sennheiser RS120 owners face, but the reason behind it will surprise you!

First, let's understand how the Sennheiser RS120 charging system works. The headphones come with a charging dock that connects to a power source. When you place the headphones on the dock, they start charging, and the charge LED turns on to indicate the charging status. However, if the LED isn't working, it can be difficult to know when your headphones are charged and when you should unplug them from the charger.

So, what's the cause of this issue? The answer is simple, but surprising - it's the battery type! Yes, you read that right! The Sennheiser RS120 headphones use nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, which have a memory effect. In simpler terms, it means that if you charge the battery when it's not fully discharged, it starts to remember the level it was charged at, and it only charges up to that level in the future. This results in a reduced battery life, and in some cases, the charge LED doesn't work at all!

Now, you may be wondering, what can you do about it? The answer is straightforward - fully discharge and recharge the battery a few times. This will help reset the memory effect and enable the battery to charge fully in the future. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Use the headphones until they completely run out of battery and turn off.
2. Charge the headphones fully and leave them on the charger for an additional two hours after the LED turns off.
3. Repeat this process two to three times to reset the memory effect.

By following these steps, you should see an improvement in the battery life of your Sennheiser RS120 headphones, and the charge LED should start working correctly. However, if the problem persists, you may need to replace the batteries or contact Sennheiser customer support for further assistance.

In conclusion, the cause of the charge LED issue in Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones is the NiMH battery type and the memory effect it causes. However, by fully discharging and recharging the batteries a few times, you can reset the memory effect and improve the battery life. So, if you're having trouble with your Sennheiser RS120 headphones, try this solution, and you may be surprised at the result!
