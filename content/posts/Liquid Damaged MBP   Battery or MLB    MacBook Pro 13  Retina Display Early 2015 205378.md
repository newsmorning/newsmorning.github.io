However, many users have reported a potential disaster with their MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 due to liquid damage on the battery or the MLB (Main Logic Board). This article will explore this issue and provide solutions to prevent further damage.

Background:

The MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 has a glued battery that is difficult to replace. Users had to go to authorized Apple service centers to get the battery replaced. Apple designed the MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 battery to last around 1000 cycles, which translates to about 3-5 years of regular usage before needing a battery replacement.

However, the design of the MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 battery also made it susceptible to liquid damage. Liquid damage can cause the battery to short circuit or corrode the battery's interior, leading to a swollen battery or burned-out motherboard.

Analysis:

Many users have reported that their MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 has experienced liquid damage, and the most common cause is spilled water or other liquids on the keyboard. Once the liquid seeps into the keyboard, it can damage the battery and the motherboard.

The MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 has an integrated design, which means that the battery, motherboard, and other components are interconnected. Therefore, damage to one component can cause damage to other parts. If the liquid damage is severe, it can cause the laptop to stop working altogether.

Solution:

If you spill liquid on your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015, the first step is to turn it off and disconnect the charger. Next, wipe the keyboard and all the visible liquid with a dry cloth. Turn the laptop upside down and let it dry for at least 24 hours before turning it back on.

If the laptop does not turn on after this process, it is likely that the battery or the motherboard has been damaged. In this case, it is best to take the laptop to an authorized Apple service center for repair.

Preventive Measures:

To prevent liquid damage to your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015, you should avoid using it near liquids or in damp environments. If you must use it near liquids, use a spill-proof keyboard cover to protect the keyboard from spills.

You can also invest in a laptop case or sleeve that is water-resistant to protect the laptop from accidental spills or rain. Additionally, you should not charge your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 with a damaged charger, as this can also cause damage to the battery and the motherboard.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 users should be aware of the risks associated with liquid damage to their laptops. Spilled liquids can damage the battery and the motherboard, leading to a costly repair or replacement.

If you spill liquid on your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015, turn it off immediately and disconnect the charger. After wiping the liquid with a dry cloth, let it dry for at least 24 hours before turning it back on.

To prevent liquid damage, avoid using the laptop near liquids or in damp environments.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a 13" MBP 2015 that had some minor water damage. The liquid damage sensors on the MLB are all still white but the sensors on the battery board, the I/O board, and the wireless card were red and clearly damaged.
I started easy and cheap and replaced the I/O, airport, and D/C boards... but that doesnt seem to have changed anything. I can't get it to boot at all.
I might try to clean the components next but am looking for advice where to start my next phase of diagnostics?
Do I replace the battery? Should it turn on with the battery disconnected and Magsafe attached? The MagSafe doesnt turn colors or even acknowledge attachment when connected.
Please advise! Thanks!!

 normal liquid damage sensors are the opposite of what you described: white is bad (water tripped) with red being un touched.
