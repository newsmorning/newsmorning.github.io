Title: Is Your Lenovo P2 Not Charging? This Simple Trick Will Shock You!

Introduction:
Are you facing charging issues with your Lenovo P2? It's frustrating to see your phone's battery level drop while plugged in. Don't worry; you're not alone. Many Lenovo P2 users have reported charging problems. But, the good news is that you don't need to rush to the service center. There's a simple trick that can fix the issue. Read on to know more.

Body:
Firstly, let's look at the possible reasons why your Lenovo P2 might not be charging. The most common one is a faulty charging cable or adapter. Sometimes, a dust particle can settle in the charging port, blocking the connection. Another cause could be a software glitch, which is hindering the charging process.

Now, coming to the solution. The trick here lies in the charging cable. Yes, you read it right. If your Lenovo P2 is not charging, try using a different charging cable with a higher amperage rating. The ideal rating is 2A or above.

A higher amperage cable charges your phone faster and more efficiently. The Lenovo P2 has a 5100mAh battery, which is quite large. Hence, a charging cable with a lower amperage rating cannot provide enough power. It will take a longer time to charge your phone and might even stop charging in between.

Moreover, a high-quality charging cable ensures the safety of your device. Cheap cables can damage your phone's charging port or reduce the battery life in the long run.

Apart from the charging cable, you can also try a different adapter. Check if the current adapter is providing enough power output. Connect it to a different device and see if it's charging properly. If not, consider replacing the adapter.

Lastly, you can also check for software updates. Lenovo releases firmware updates periodically, which can fix charging-related issues. Go to 'Settings' > 'System Update' and check for updates.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, not being able to charge your Lenovo P2 is a common issue faced by many users. But, it can be easily resolved by using a charging cable with a higher amperage rating. A 2A cable or above will provide sufficient power and charge your phone faster. Also, ensure that you are using a high-quality cable and adapter to avoid any damage to your device. If the problem persists, check for software updates or consult a professional.

So, hurry up, try this simple trick and get your Lenovo P2 charging again!
