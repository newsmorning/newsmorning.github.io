# Are You Ready for the Ultimate Tech Showdown? The Debate Rages On – Should Windows 10 Really Be Windows 8 2? See What Experts and Fans are Saying!

The tech industry is always evolving, and Microsoft’s Windows operating system is no exception. In recent years, the tech giant has released multiple updates to its flagship OS – Windows 8, 8.1, and now Windows 10. However, even after five years since its launch, Windows 8 still generates numerous debates and arguments among the tech enthusiasts. Some believe that Windows 10 is nothing but an enhanced version of Windows 8, while others think they are two separate entities with fundamental differences. The debate on whether Windows 10 should be called Windows 8 2 has been ongoing for years, and in this article, we’ll explore both sides of the coin to help you decide which one you agree with.

## The Case for Windows 10 as Windows 8 2

One of the most prominent arguments for Windows 10 as Windows 8 2 is the similarities between both operating systems. Microsoft introduced several new features and design changes in Windows 8, which received mixed reactions from the tech community. The most significant shift was the removal of the traditional Start menu, which was replaced by a full-screen tile-based Start screen. Moreover, Microsoft introduced live tiles, which displayed dynamic information on the Start screen.

While some users liked the new look and feel of Windows 8, many complained about the steep learning curve and the overwhelming changes. Windows 8 also received criticism for lacking compatibility with legacy applications and software. To address these issues, Microsoft released Windows 8.1, which brought back the Start button and allowed users to boot straight to the desktop. However, the Start menu was still missing, which irked some users.

Fast forward to 2015, Microsoft introduced Windows 10, which combined the best of both worlds – the simplicity and familiarity of the Start menu, and the modern and innovative live tiles. With Windows 10, Microsoft made a pivot to refine its vision of the next-generation Windows operating system. The company explained that Windows 10 was not just an upgrade from Windows 8.1, but an entirely new release with new features, security updates, and better device management options.

Despite Microsoft's assertions, some experts and fans still think that Windows 10 is just a rebranded version of Windows 8, with minor tweaks and features added.

## The Case against Windows 10 as Windows 8 2

On the other hand, many tech experts and fans believe that Windows 10 is entirely different from Windows 8, and it’s erroneous to call it Windows 8 2. This argument is based on the fundamental changes made by Microsoft to the operating system.

For starters, Windows 10 brought back the Start menu in its traditional form, fixing a major concern for a significant chunk of Windows 8 users. Further, Microsoft incorporated several features to enhance the user experience, including a virtual assistant, Cortana, and the option to create virtual desktops. They also included an updated Action Center, which consolidated notifications from different applications and showcased them on one screen.

Equally, Windows 10 addressed several compatibility issues with Windows 8, making the new release more attractive to enterprise-level customers. Windows 10 also introduced features such as OneDrive cloud storage and Windows Hello biometric authentication, which were not present in Windows 8. 

Moreover, Microsoft has since stopped supporting Windows 8, signaling the end of its lifecycle with no future enhancement releases in sight.

## Our Verdict

So, should Windows 10 be called Windows 8 2? In our opinion, no. While Windows 10 borrows some aspects of its predecessor, it’s an independent operating system that Microsoft redesigned from the ground up. Windows 10 has numerous new features and design changes that differentiate it from Windows 8, making it unique.

As technology evolves at a breakneck pace, the discussion of Windows 10 as Windows 8 2 will continue to ignite debates among tech enthusiasts. Regardless of your stance, it’s essential to consider the evolution of the Windows operating system, its future roadmap, and individual user preferences when making this decision. Ultimately, whether you believe Windows 10 is a clever rebranding of Windows 8 or a distinct OS in its own right, it’s hard to deny that Microsoft has continued to lead the way in the tech industry with innovative and intuitive software solutions.

It’s been a while since Microsoft released it’s Technical Preview for Windows 10 and a lot of people had an opportunity to test it. Of course, there are positive and negative reviews, but one question arises, is Windows 10 really worth to be called the brand new operating system, or is it just an improved version of Windows 8?

Before we start our debate, I have to say that this is just a Technical Preview of the new operating system, so many new features are excluded from it, but we can make an analysis based on what we got so far.
 
After testing Windows 10, most users were satisfied with it, way more than they were with Windows 8 (Just as a reminder, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 combined had a minor operating system market share of just 16.8%, which is unacceptable for Microsoft). The main reason for positive reviews is that people got what they requested, the Start Menu. This is also the main feature of Windows 10 Technical Preview, and the main change, besides some other interface tweaks, all other stuff are almost the same as they were in Windows 8 or 8.1. So an average user could tell, why this is presented as a brand new operating system, when there’s only one crucial change? Because of that, a lot of people call it Windows 8.2.
 
In my opinion answer for that question lays in the name of Windows 10. When Microsoft skipped one number and presented the new operating system to go by the name of Windows 10 they explained that they’re not “building and incremental product,” but people understood it as a way for Microsoft to distant from Windows 8 as much as possible. Because of that, people expected wonders from Windows 10 and expected it to be drastically different from Windows 8. But if we take a look at history of Windows OS, neither version of Windows is drastically different than its predecessor. Here’s a proof I found on Microsoft forum:
 
- Windows NT 4.0 (along the same time as Windows 95)
 - Windows 2000 was just NT 5.0
 - Windows XP was just NT 5.1
 - Windows Vista was 6.0 and was a major change, mostly to take advantage of new hardware for things like graphics acceleration that were never possible before.
 - Windows 7 was just 6.1 and really just changed some taskbar behaviors.
 - Windows 8 was 6.2 and although it looked different, the big change was just a bigger (full-screen) start menu. Although it was big, it had the same function (shortcuts and an ‘all programs’ directory).
 - Windows 8.1 was 6.3 and added some mouse functions and title bars
 - Windows 10 is just going to be 6.4.

 
So the impression is that people really expect too much from just a Technical Preview of the new Windows. But there’s another interesting inference from this. It looks like people didn’t disliked Windows 8 as much as they disliked its certain features. And now when we have Windows 8 look-a-like operating system with improved features (read: Start Menu), people are pretty much satisfied with it and experts are predicting that Windows 10 will do much better job than Windows 8 did.
 
Also, as I said at the beginning of the article, this is just a Technical Preview, and a lot of features, along with Microsoft’s much anticipated voice assistant Cortana, need to be included in the final version, so I think that we should wait until the final release to make comparisons.
