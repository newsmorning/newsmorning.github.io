The company aims to capture the tablet market by adopting a new approach, which has surprised many experts in the industry.\nBody:\nThe shift in strategy by Dell will see it focus on offering tablets for businesses rather than consumers. The company has identified that there is a lucrative market that is yet to be fully exploited in the business sector. It plans to offer tablets that run on the Google Android operating system, which is a departure from Dell’s previous strategy that focused on Microsoft Windows-based tablets.\nDell will leverage its strength in the business market to push the new tablets, which will have features tailored to meet the needs of corporate clients. The company has already partnered with Microsoft to offer Windows 365, a cloud-based platform that will run on the Android-based tablets.\nDell is taking a different path compared to its competitors such as Apple and Samsung, which have largely focused on the consumer market. The move is risky, but Dell is confident that it will pay off, given that the business market is still largely untapped. Experts predict that Dell could capture a significant market share in the business tablet market with its new strategy.\nThe computer giant’s move has been well received by analysts, who acknowledge that the company has the potential to disrupt the tablet market. Dell’s strength in the business sector, coupled with its partnership with Microsoft, could give it a competitive edge in the market.\nConclusion:\nDell’s dramatic shift in tablet strategy is a bold move that could change the dynamics of the tablet market. The company has identified a potentially lucrative market in the business sector, which it plans to capture with its new Android-based tablets. Although the move is risky, Dell has the potential to disrupt the market and capture a significant market share. The computer giant’s partnership with Microsoft is another advantage that could give it a competitive edge. It remains to be seen how Dell’s new strategy will pan out, but many experts agree that it is a smart move that could pay dividends in the long run.\nDell is ditching its Android tablet ambitions and moving to rejuvenate is focus on Windows-related devices. The plan here is to completely discontinue manufacturing Android devices in the near future and end updates to existing devices.\nAccording to Dell, the company views 2-in-1 Windows 10 computers as preferred hardware by businesses and regular consumers alike. By moving away from Android, Dell is acknowledging consumer preference, which makes sense: They understand there’s no need to own both a tablet and a laptop when a 2-in-1 device would be both less troublesome and less expensive as well.\nThe company notes the standard tablet market experienced a 21.1% decline in sales during the last quarter. For 2-in-1 devices, Dell views this as the only growing segment of the computer market right now, and will likely continue to grow for a number of years.\nWe believe 2-in-1s are starting to become the preferred device for those in the workplace who occasionally want to operate the device in tablet mode, which is why we’re continuing to invest in the space, while beginning to divest from the slate tablet market.\nThe big question is, why are consumers pivoting to 2-in-1 devices? Dell has the answer:\nUnfortunately, Windows 10 does not translate well on 2-in-1s. The operating system is great in desktop mode, but not so good when in tablet mode, something that could prove to be a big problem.\n“Productivity: 2-in-1s should focus on being a laptop first, then a tablet, which is the only way they fit in a commercial environment. Dell’s newest Latitude lineup boasts business-class features like Intel’s latest processors, large and rich screens for viewing content, full-size ports and keyboards and more, all to help you work on the go. Flexibility: while the standard issued work device is typically a laptop or desktop, it can be nice to have a tablet for some business functions – but is it worth carrying two systems? Our fully flexible lineup of Dell 2-in-1s are designed to go wherever work takes you. Regarding the new Latitude 12 7000 Series 2-in-1, Digital Trendsconcluded, “Slim, light, and versatile, the Dell Latitude 12 is an excellent system for the on-the-go user who does a little bit of everything.” Value: on-the-go professionals and corridor warriors will love the way 2-in-1s enhance their workflows, but IT decision makers can truly appreciate the value in a system that can be both a laptop and tablet. Gone are the days of purchasing multiple devices for workers, or compromising by choosing only one. Security, Manageability \u0026 Support: Our commitment to customers is to deliver the most secure, most manageable and most reliable solutions in the industry. The Dell Data Protection | Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise is now available and encompasses encryption, authentication and now greater advanced threat protection. And with ProSupport Plus for PCs and tablets, Dell is the only OEM to provide automated proactive and predictive support capabilities across PCs, tablets, servers, storage and networking.” Not convinced? Well, recently Dell announced the Inspiron 7000 line of 2-in-1 Windows 10 computers that begins at the cool price of $749 — maybe that’s enough to give it a shot.\nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:\nSatya Nadella visits India and China to discuss technology development and anti-trust probe New Dell Venue 8 Pro 5000 Comes with Windows 10 and Improved Specs Dell Unveils Inspiron 11 3000, a Budget Friendly Windows 10 Laptop If the advices above haven’t solved your issue, your PC may experience deeper Windows problems.
