# Revolutionize Your Twitter Game with Podcasts - But Be Prepared for Disappointment!

Twitter has emerged as one of the most prominent social media platforms, providing businesses an opportunity to connect with their audience and promote products and services. However, the challenge remains how to keep the audience engaged, which can sometimes be challenging considering the saturation in the market. As a business, you may have tried different strategies to keep your followers engaged, but have you tried incorporating podcasts into your Twitter game? While the integration of podcasting with Twitter can revolutionize your online presence, there is a possibility of disappointment.

## Understanding the Benefits of Podcasting on Twitter

Podcasting involves the creation of audio content that users can download and listen to at any time. With podcasting, a business can develop a platform where their followers access audiobooks, tutorials or even interviews with industry experts. If used effectively, podcasts can help revolutionize the business's Twitter game by:

- Offering a personal connection: Businesses can build relationships with their audience by allowing them to listen to the voices and stories behind the business.
- Providing a unique approach to content creation: Podcasts offer an opportunity for businesses to tap into the auditory market, which may be ignored by other businesses.
- Offering flexibility: By creating and posting podcasts, businesses provide an opportunity for a wider audience to listen to their content at their convenience.
- Enhancing discoverability: Through podcasting, businesses can connect with users searching for content on various platforms such as Spotify, Apple Podcasts or iHeartRadio.

## Why Businesses May Experience Disappointment

Despite the potential benefits, businesses may experience disappointment due to the following reasons:

- Lack of Consistency: The key to success when it comes to podcasting is making sure you produce new episodes consistently. If you fail to keep up with an episode schedule, your followers may lose interest.
- Poor Content Quality: Businesses have to create content that goes beyond mere advertisements. To attract and retain listeners, businesses must ensure their podcast topics are captivating and informative. Lack of quality content may drive followers away.
- Increased Competition: The podcast industry is growing at a rapid pace, with businesses fighting for attention from the same audience. Your podcast may get lost in the crowd if you don't take time to build a unique and identifiable brand.

## Conclusion

Podcasting on Twitter can revolutionize your online presence, with the potential to increase your following and promote your products or services. However, businesses must understand the potential disappointment that comes with podcast integration. To achieve success, it is crucial that businesses create quality content consistently and ensure that it is unique in style and purpose. With the proper planning and execution, integrating podcasts with your Twitter game can be a game-changer for your online presence.

Twitter is adding podcasts to its app, but those hoping to find fun new things to listen to could wind up being disappointed, experts say.

 
- Twitter is adding podcasts to its mobile apps.Some people could discover podcasts for the first time.Experts don’t expect Twitter to help existing listeners looking for something new.

 

Twitter recently announced plans to add podcasts to a redesigned Spaces tab on mobile, promising to make it easier for people to "simply hit play and go." In a blog post, the platform stated it will "automatically suggest compelling podcasts to help people easily find and listen to the topics they want to hear more about," but experts worry this new way won't help people discover fresh content but rather feed them what they already consume.

 

"If they're basing the recommendations on who you're following and their algorithm, then people will just see what they're already following," Eric Silver, head of creative at podcast firm Multitude Productions, told Lifewire via email.

 
##   The Discoverability Problem  
 

A 2022 Edison Research study shows that 177 million people across the United States have listened to at least one podcast, equating to 62% of the population aged 12+. That number represents an increase over the 57% figure from 2021, and of the 1,502 respondents, 38% listened to a podcast within the last month. By adding podcasts to the Spaces tab, Twitter could make it easier for those people to find new voices to listen to while simultaneously introducing the world of podcasts to a whole new audience.

 

That's something experts hope for anyway, but they aren't convinced. Podcast discoverability is something podcast creators and media companies continue to wrestle with. Twitter's move into podcasts is seen as one with potential, but only if its recommendations are varied enough to introduce people to new shows.

 

"I feel like this will be just another way for already popular shows to get in front of eyeballs, rather than a solution to the podcast discovery problem," Silver added. "If it works in a way that is unexpected, great!"

 

Podcaster Melanie Benson is more hopeful, but not about the feature as it's been announced. She's already looking beyond the Spaces tab and wonders if podcasts could become a key part of a Twitter user's profile.

 

"Even better would be Twitter allowing you to integrate your [podcast's] RSS Feed into your Twitter profile so that when an episode goes live, it automatically publishes to your feed," suggested Benson. 

 

Such a move would reduce the friction between seeing a podcast and actually listening to it, says Silver, suggesting that shortening that process could benefit podcasters and listeners alike. 

 

"The social media platform that most podcast listeners use is Twitter, and it takes five clicks of a mouse to get from seeing a tweet about a fun podcast to actually getting someone to subscribe," he said.

 
##   Podcasts and Spaces, a Perfect Match  
 

The pairing of podcasts and Spaces is one that could add value for listeners, too. Spaces already give Twitter users a way to discuss almost any topic using real-time voice chats, and the juxtaposition of that feature with the recorded, edited conversations of podcasts is notable.

 

Benson believes Twitter could choose to allow people to convert a Space into a podcast, effectively turning the app into a podcast recording solution of sorts. Podcaster and Twitter creator Kelly Ann Collins agrees, adding that "Spaces is a great tool for communicating with your community live on Twitter—but not every person can join live. A Spaces archive and podcast feature is just what Twitter needs to reach more users, and to create more conversation on the platform."

 

Unfortunately, that's all pie-in-the-sky stuff, and what Twitter has announced isn't getting too many experts excited that it will surface new shows and creators to expectant listeners.

"If Twitter is trying to attract people who have never heard a podcast before and will theoretically listen exclusively in Twitter Spaces, their first podcast is going to be who they have a relationship with, the old guard in the space (like NPR), or the podcast of an influencer who is already dominating their algorithm," Sliver warns.
