# Are You Still Struggling to Charge Your iPhone 7 After Replacing the Lightning Connector? Here's What You Need to Know!

If you have recently replaced your iPhone 7's lightning connector, but it still struggles to charge, it can be frustrating. After all, you invested time and money to get it fixed. However, it is not unusual for users to experience issues even after replacing the lightning connector.

In this article, we will be discussing the reasons why your iPhone 7 might not be charging properly, even after replacing the lightning connector.

## Faulty Components

Your iPhone 7's charging problems might not necessarily be related to the lightning connector that you recently replaced. Instead, the issue may be with other components in your phone. For example, a damaged battery or charging port could be the root cause of your troubles. If you have already exhausted all troubleshooting options after replacing your lightning connector, it might be time to seek professional help.

## Using Low-Quality Lightning Connectors

One other reason why your iPhone 7 is still struggling to charge after replacing the lightning connector might be the quality of the connector you purchased. Avoid using low-quality lightning connectors to replace damaged ones. If you buy a cheap knock-off or incompatible connector, it may not be able to handle the power necessary to charge your device fully.

## Software Problems

Sometimes, software glitches can lead to charging issues. The solution to such problems is usually a software update. Check if your iPhone 7 is up-to-date with the latest iOS version. Additionally, resetting your iPhone 7 can also solve software-related issues.

## Maintaining Your iPhone 7's Battery Health

If your phone is charging but running out of battery quickly, it might be time to change your battery. A battery replacement service or getting a new refurbished phone can be an answer to such issues. Additionally, it's important to maintain your battery's health to prevent charging issues in the future. Avoid exposing your iPhone to high temperatures or changing its battery below 20%, when possible, as doing so could affect the battery's lifespan and thereby its charging capacity.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're still struggling with charging issues even after replacing your iPhone 7's lightning connector, there could be several possible reasons behind it. Accordingly, we recommend you troubleshoot your device thoroughly, examine your new connector's quality, update your device's software, and maintain your battery health to increase your device's longevity. If your iPhone 7 still has charging issues despite your efforts, it may be time to consult an Apple expert to identify and fix the issue.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the lightning connector via this guide, really good one. However, I still cannot charge my phone, but the mic and antennas work. I managed to charge the battery directly via an activator circuit and I can power up the phone without any problems. What could be the issue? It is the second lightning connector I try and I have had the same problem both times - everything works except the charging portâ€¦
Thank you in advance
Best regards

 More then likely you have a Tristar issue
