Title: You Won't Believe How Charging My iPhone 5C Caused Touchscreen Problems!

Introduction:

In recent years, smartphones have become an essential part of our daily lives. It is not just a device to make phone calls, but it is a whole lot more than that. People use their smartphones for everything from checking emails, social media, navigation, and even for payments. One of the most popular smartphones is the iPhone, which is known for its sleek design and advanced features. However, some iPhone users have reported that their touchscreens become unresponsive when they charge their phones. In this article, we will explore this issue and why it happens.

Body:

Touchscreen issues on an iPhone can be frustrating because it prevents you from using your phone until the problem is fixed. There are several reasons why a touchscreen becomes unresponsive, such as a software glitch, physical damage, or a faulty screen. However, one lesser-known reason is the charging cable.

The charging cable that comes with your iPhone 5C is designed to charge your device quickly and efficiently. However, using a non-certified charging cable or a damaged one can cause issues with the touchscreen. A non-certified charging cable can generate too much voltage, which can cause electrical interference in the touchscreen, resulting in unresponsiveness.

Furthermore, a damaged charging cable can cause intermittent connectivity and can create a short circuit, which can also cause problems with the touchscreen. If your charging cable is damaged, it is crucial to replace it with a new one to prevent any further damage to your iPhone.

Another reason why charging can cause touchscreen issues is overheating. When your iPhone 5C charges, it generates heat, which can cause damage to the battery and the touchscreen if it exceeds the safe temperature limit. Overheating can cause the adhesive that holds the touchscreen to the phone to melt, causing the screen to become unresponsive.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, charging your iPhone 5C with a non-certified or damaged charging cable can cause problems with the touchscreen. Moreover, overheating while charging can also cause damage to the touchscreen. Therefore, it is essential to use certified charging cables and ensure that your iPhone does not overheat while charging. If your touchscreen issue persists, it is best to take your phone to a professional to prevent further damage. Hopefully, this article has helped you understand why charging your iPhone 5C can lead to touchscreen problems and how to prevent it.

## Chosen Solution
 So lately I've had the problem of my phone's touch display malfunctioning when connected to a charger (This includes when it's 100% and charging)
Say this:
I'm typing a message in Whatsapp, and when I press the E button on the keyboard it spaces out and presses something else instead, (not just typing, but swiping, scrolling, anything that requires touch input (which is basically everything))
I think I might be able to fix this myself, but I'd need to know which part it would be, does anyone know which part to replace if that's the problem?
Note: this only happens when I'm in using an app or doing anything, when I'm on the lock or home screen it works perfectly fine, however even in the notification centre it causes this issue.
Second Note: Mostly the bottom area gets affected the most

 It's a common issue with aftermarket screens.
Only solution is to get higher quality aftermarket screens or just use refurbished OEM / original 5C screens.
Or somehow better grounding on the screen, which I don't think it's possible would fix the problem as well.
