Title: Shocking revelation: This TV owner discovers the alarming truth behind their 55L7453D TV's backlight - you won't believe what happened next!

Have you ever had a strange feeling that something about your electronics is not quite right? This was the case for John Jacobson, the owner of a 55L7453D TV from a well-known brand. For months, he had noticed that the picture on his TV wasn't as clear as it used to be, but he couldn't quite put his finger on the problem.

One day, John decided to investigate the issue, and what he found was shocking. The backlight behind his TV screen, which is responsible for illuminating the picture and creating the contrast between light and dark, was malfunctioning. Not only that, but it was emitting dangerous levels of radiation.

John had heard about the risks of radiation from electronic devices, but he didn't expect to find them in his own TV. He was determined to find a solution to the problem, so he contacted the manufacturer's customer support team.

To his surprise, he was met with a dismissive attitude. The representative he spoke with tried to assure him that the TV was safe and that the problem was likely due to user error. But John knew there was more to the story.

After doing some research online and consulting with other experts in the field, John discovered that his TV was not the only one with this issue. There were many other customers who had experienced the same problem and were also met with a lack of concern from the manufacturer.

Determined to get to the bottom of the issue, John took to social media to share his story and raise awareness about the dangers of faulty electronics. The response was overwhelming, with many others sharing their own stories of similar experiences.

Eventually, the manufacturer was forced to take action and issue a recall for the affected TVs. John's persistence and dedication to uncovering the truth had paid off, and he had helped to make a difference in the safety of consumers everywhere.

In conclusion, the story of John's TV backlight malfunction may sound like a typical tech issue, but it highlights the importance of being aware of the potential dangers of our electronic devices. When something seems off, it's important to investigate and not be dismissed by customer support. And most importantly, through our collective efforts, we can make a difference and hold companies accountable for the safety of their products.

 Hi I tested the LEDs one by one with LED tester and working fine but the TV switches it self off after a while do you think this is a power board fault?do you know how to test the power board?thanks

 Gadu muzik, this is a Toshiba 55l7453d? It could be the power board but remember that it is the main board that tells the power board to turn the LEDâ€™s on (simplified). You did not tell us if you have sound on your TV at all. If not then it is most likely the power board. If it does have sound but no picture it could be the main board/power board.Some Toshibas will also have black screen but sound with a bad T-Con board. So we need to see more of your boards.
