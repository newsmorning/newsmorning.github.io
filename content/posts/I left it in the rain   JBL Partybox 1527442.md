As music lovers, we all know how important it is to have the perfect equipment to set the mood for a party. And when it comes to sound quality and lighting effects, nothing beats the JBL PartyBox series.

However, have you ever wondered what would happen if you left your JBL PartyBox in the rain for an extended period? Well, I am here to share my experience and tell you what happened when I made this mistake.

It was a typical Friday evening, and I was excited to host a small get-together at my place. I had everything set up, the drinks, snacks, and the JBL PartyBox 300. I turned on the PartyBox and played some of the latest tracks. Everyone was having a great time, dancing and singing along.

As the night progressed, the skies unexpectedly opened up, and it began to pour heavily. Worried about my guests, I rushed everyone inside the house, leaving the PartyBox out in the rain. It was an accident nobody could have foreseen, but we had all our attention on making sure our guests were comfortable.

As the rain intensified through the night, I could not help but wonder what would happen to my prized speaker outside. I was sure it would be damaged beyond repair.

The following morning, as the rains finally subsided, I went outside to check on the PartyBox. To my surprise, it was still functioning! I couldn't believe it. The JBL PartyBox 300, which is designed for outdoor use, had survived the heavy rain.

Impressed with its durability, I decided to test it again, this time on purpose. I set the speaker outside for an extended period, letting it sit in the rain. After several hours, I brought it back inside and tested it again. To my amazement, the sound had not changed, and the lights still worked incredibly.

Over the years, JBL has earned a reputation for producing high-quality audio and technical equipment designed for exceptional sound and durability. Their PartyBox series is a perfect exemplification of their superior craftsmanship, with its weather-resistance, portability, and impeccable sound quality.

In conclusion, I must say that I was amazed by the JBL PartyBox 300's resilience when it comes to weather. If you're someone who loves to host parties or spends more time outdoors, then the JBL PartyBox 300 is an excellent investment. And even if the weather turns bad suddenly, you can relax and be confident that your PartyBox will survive.

 so last night had a party.. thought I grabbed my speaker and didn't, woke up it's pouring rain, still didn't realize I left it. I then realized i left it got the water off it, it's been abt 6 hrs I turned it on it booted up an connected as should started playing song, it worked then started crackling. what do you recommend i do let it air dry tear it apart? need ideas an suggestions thank you

 Hey, Morgan.
You have a few ways you can go about this. And just remember that when you are following any of these steps, try to move the speaker a minimal amount. Any movement can displace the water further into the device, and increase damage.
You can just let it air dry for a few days and hope it's fine. I'd estimate you've got a %40 chance of saving it by air-drying. If you choose this option,  you probably won't mind if it stops working. The next two options are ways to actually fix it, instead of just hoping for recovery.You can try to save it without opening it, and here's how: Start by drying all moisture on the outside of the speaker with a microfiber towel*******. Use a handheld vacuum cleaner to suck water out of all holes, including the front where sound is emitted.Do not set the vacuum's power to an unnecessarily high amount, as it could loosen some internals. After these steps, leave the speaker to dry in a warm, well-lit******** place. You can set your speaker in the window, just as long as it remains together. If you open the speaker, put it back together before exposing it to sunlight.You can open it. Open the speaker and dry all visible moisture with a microfiber cloth. Leave the components out to dry on their own, or in front of a low-power fan*********. You can also use a low-heat hair-dryer*********.  Do not use a high-powered fan, as it could damage some components.Also, don't leave the speaker's internals to dry in sunlight.****After 6 hours, I'm assuming you already did this.********I'm not sure if having a well-lit area is actually helpful, but it just sounds like it makes sense.*********Don't  read option 3 and think you can use a hair-dryer or low-powered fan in option 2. Using a hair-dryer or fan without opening the device, as the air will likely push moisture further back in the device.***I hope this helps save your speaker

 Hi,
The impurities in the water causes corrosion and provides circuit paths for the electricity which were not in the speaker's operating design and could damage the components. The corrosion starts immediately and is ongoing until it is completely cleaned away
First do not try to charge or to turn on your speaker and then remove the battery as soon as possible from the speaker to minimize any further damage.
Then you need to dis-assemble the rest of the speaker and clean all the affected parts using Isopropyl Alcohol 99%+ (available at electronics parts stores) to remove all traces of corrosion and water. If possible do not use "rubbing alcohol" as in some cases this is only 70% IPA or less, can contain additives and is not as effective. If you do have to use it check the label to verify the  amount of IPA. The higher the percentage of IPA the better
Here is a link that describes the process. Electronics Water Damage
As always with electronics, especially surface mounted pcb be gentle when handling and especially when brushing away the corrosion. You do not want to remove any components from the board. Remove the shields that may be covering some components as the water may have got in under there. The ends of any flex cables and their connectors need to be cleaned as well
Hopefully after you have done all this the speaker might possibly work correctly again.
Here is a link to a teardown video that may help.
If this process seems too daunting, take your speaker to a reputable, professional electronics repair service, experienced in liquid damage repair and ask for a quote for a repair. If you decide to do this, do it sooner than later.
