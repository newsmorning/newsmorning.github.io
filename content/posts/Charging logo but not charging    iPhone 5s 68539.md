Title: You Won't Believe Why Your iPhone 5S Charging Logo Is On But Not Actually Charging! 

As an iPhone 5S user, you might have faced the issue of the charging logo being on while your phone is not charging. The situation is frustrating and can leave you wondering why it's happening. The good news is that you're not alone, and this is a known issue in some iPhone 5S models. 

The reason why your iPhone 5S charging logo is on but not actually charging is due to a problem with the charging port. The port may have debris, dust, or lint accumulated in it, causing it to malfunction. When the charging port is not adequately cleaned, it can result in poor contact between the charging cable and port. 

To fix this issue, you can try cleaning the charging port yourself. First, turn off the phone and unplug it from the charger. Then, take a small, clean toothbrush and gently brush the inside of the charging port to remove any debris or lint. You can also try blowing the port with compressed air or a straw to dislodge any dirt. 

If cleaning the charging port is not successful, you might need to consider replacing it. You can visit a certified iPhone repair shop or Apple store to have this done professionally. 

Another solution to the problem of the iPhone not charging is to try a different charging cable or adapter. A faulty cable or adapter could also cause the charging issue. 

It's frustrating when your iPhone 5S won't charge despite the charging logo being on. But, instead of getting stressed out, try the methods mentioned above, and you might be able to solve your charging issue. If the problem persists, it's always best to seek professional help. 

In conclusion, the problem of the iPhone 5S charging logo being on but not actually charging is caused by poor contact between the charging cable and the port due to debris, dust, or lint accumulation. A simple cleaning of the charging port can fix the issue. Additionally, replacing the charging port or using a different charging cable or adapter can also solve the problem. With these tips, you can take care of your iPhone 5S and make sure it is always charged and ready to use!

## Chosen Solution
 This started last week. I noticed my iphone 5s battery percentage wasn't increasing but the lightening charging indicator is coming on!
So after a look around the internet I couldn't find anything the same.
I tried changing the charger to another working one in our house. still the same
I tried doing a reset (holding down the power and home button until the apple logo comes on then releasing)....still nothing.
I tried clearing the phone and fully resetting every, nothing still.
I do keep my phone updated, however this happened long after.
So sounds like the battery right?....
I changed the battery and it charges like a trooper, woohoo!
First thing I notice is that it seems to stay at 100% for too long.
After 2 days it starts to drop to 95% and won't charge again.
So I change the battery again, and it charges again...
Same thing as above.
after fitting the battery the 2nd time around, I charged it for 8 hours as they tell you to when buying a new phone?
but still no joy.
I'm wondering if theirs something you're supposed to do when fitting a new battery?
Or... do you think the board is gone?
Or..just another faulty battery?
Seems funny that they all do the same.
Before all this, my original battery was just fine.
Update (08/02/2016)
Hi, Nothing went wrong with the change over at all. I'm not a repair guy but I'm quite handy with this sort of thing.
I just find it funny how it charges for 2 days then stops.
Unplugging the battery for a few minutes doesn't get it charging again either. the only way to get it to charge is to fit a new battery. almost like it's popping a fuse inside the battery? might be over charging?
If it's not the battery, then the original battery must not have been at fault in the first place.
But still can't understand why it charges when changing the battery.

 I realize this is an old post, but it might help someone else.
This might sound silly, but have you checked the inside of the lightning port? I have seen this sort of behavior many times only to discover that the port had compacted pocket lint/dirt/debris inside the port, preventing a reliable charge. You can use a toothpick to gently pull the debris out and then use something like a toothbrush with 91% or higher isopropyl alcohol to clean the port and then see if it’s charging normally.  If your iPhone happens to be a black version, the port is also black and sometimes it’s hard to see if there is anything in the port at all as the debris will compact and “mold” itself to the inside of the port, making it very difficult to tell if there is anything in there at all until you give it a gentle scrape and start pulling it out.
The white model ones are much easier as you should be able to look into the port and if you don’t see white at the back of the port, it’s certainly dirty.
Try cleaning your port and see if you get a proper charge. I’d say that 75% of all iPhone charging issues that come into my shop are dirty ports, with the rest being batteries are rarely, the connector itself.

 hello you might try changing the charging connector, if after having replaced the problem remains I think the motherboard may have suffered damage
