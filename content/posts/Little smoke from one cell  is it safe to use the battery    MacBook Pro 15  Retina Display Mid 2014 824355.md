## Chosen Solution
 Hello, I was trying to replace my keyboard by replacing the whole upper part. Everything went well (removing everything) until the battery when I tried to remove the 3rd cell, some smoke came out. After assembling, I tried to see if my system was ok without connecting the battery and everything is fine. I also tried to turn on the computer with the battery connected, it still works. So I want to know if it's still okay to connect the battery

 I would never trust a battery that has smoked. You may have torn the cell open and trying to use it like that is a major fire risk. Very carefully get that thing out of there and in a safe space, then see if you can find a recycler around you who will take the battery. If you donâ€™t feel comfortable working around an unstable battery, it may be better to find a trusted repair shop around you to take care of it.

 Hello Marc Ilunga! As with all batteries, you should not continue using them if they are swelling, ruptured, overheating, or starting to smoke. This can indicate that there is a severe problem with the battery and that it is damaged. You should not continue using the battery in your MacBook Pro that started smoking. I would highly recommend taking all of the batteries out of your MacBook Pro and instead using it only with the included power adapter until you can get a set of replacement batteries.
