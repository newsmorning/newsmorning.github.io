# Transform Your Ordinary Boombox Into A Sound System Beast - Learn How To Add An External Audio Input Now!

When it comes to music playback devices, boomboxes are regarded as an all-time classic. They're portable, durable, and produce a decent amount of sound, making them ideal for impromptu parties, picnics, or outdoor events. However, there is one significant limitation that comes with using a boombox: the lack of an external audio input.

Without an external audio input, you're restricted to playing music through the built-in speakers or cassette/CD players. But what if we told you that you could transform your ordinary boombox into a sound system beast by adding an external audio input? Read on to learn how.

## Gathering Materials

The first step to adding an external audio input to your boombox is to gather the necessary materials. The most important element here is a 3.5 mm audio input jack, which can be found at any electronic store or online platform.

Other materials you might need include:

- Soldering iron
- Solder wire
- Screwdriver
- Electric tape
- Wire stripper

With these materials at hand, you're ready to begin the modification process.

## Disassembling Your Boombox

Before you can add an external audio input to your boombox, you'll need to disassemble it. To do this, you will need to remove the screws that hold the cover in place. You'll also need to locate the audio input circuit board, which is where you'll be soldering your new input jack.

## Soldering the External Audio Input Jack

Once you've identified the audio input circuit board, you can proceed by soldering the new input jack onto it. Here's how to do it:

1. Use the wire stripper to strip the insulation off a small section of the audio input wire.

2. Identify the positive and negative contacts on the audio input circuit board. This information is usually indicated on the board itself.

3. Apply a small amount of solder onto the positive and negative contacts.

4. Place the audio input wire onto the soldered contacts, ensuring that the positive and negative wires are connected to their respective contacts.

5. Hold the audio input wire in place with your hand, and apply the soldering iron to the contacts. This will melt the solder and bond the audio input wire to the contacts.

6. Once the bonding is complete, use the electric tape to seal the connection, ensuring that no wires or contacts are exposed.

## Reassembling Your Boombox

With the new audio input jack in place, you can reassemble your boombox. Ensure that all the screws are tightened, and all wires and contacts are well protected. Your boombox is now ready to receive audio input from external sources such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, or any other device that has a 3.5 mm audio output.

## Conclusion

Adding an external audio input jack to your boombox can transform it into a true sound system beast. With this modification, you can connect your portable music devices and enjoy loud, clear music from your boombox. The process may seem daunting, but with the right tools and know-how, anyone can upgrade their boombox. So go ahead and give it a try â€“ you'll be amazed by the results!

## Chosen Solution
 The JVC RC-X610 boombox, like a lot of JVC audio equipment, is surprisingly good but it lacks an external audio input.
Even for an experienced electronic engineer the PCB's are undecipherable without a service manual and schematic.
I have found an very expensive copy of the service manual on eBay. Where do these sellers find their manuals I wonder?
Can anybody point me to a repository of JVC service manuals or specifically, one for the JVC RC-X610 ?

 I mean if you are not willing to throw down $13 for the schemo then time must not be a big concern, so just start digging in.  I've found it pretty easy to find the place to tap into for a line in.  That place usually is the fm output buffer stage.  Find the main fm chip, look up the datasheet, find its L/R stereo out and tap in after the output buffer, but before the main selector switch or preamp.  Then place your own dpdt switch there, that way you then select between Fm or line in.  Its pretty much the only way I've found without building extra circuits.  Good luck.

 I use the line in at the back of the unit. If you push play on Tape A (with no tape present) then the incoming audio is mixed with the tape output (hiss). Adjusting the level of the input device can moderate the level of audible hiss. This is not for audiophiles, just something I discovered accidentally.
