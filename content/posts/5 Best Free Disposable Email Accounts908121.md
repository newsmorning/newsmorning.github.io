Stop Spamming! Use These 5 Free Disposable Email Accounts Instead

We all face one common problem while using our email accounts – the unwanted spam mails that keep landing in our inboxes. These spam mails not only clutter up our email inboxes but also waste our precious time. That’s where disposable email accounts come into play. A disposable email account is a temporary email account that you can use for a single use and discard it once you are done. Here are the top 5 free disposable email accounts that you can use instead of spamming.

1. Mailinator

Mailinator allows you to create an email address on the fly with the @mailinator.com domain. With this service, you can receive as many emails as you want, and the messages will remain available for a few hours.

2. Guerrilla Mail

Guerrilla Mail is another popular disposable email account provider that offers a free, disposable email address that's valid for 60 minutes. The best thing about this service is that you don't need to sign up for an account.

3. TempMail

TempMail is a free disposable email account provider that allows you to create temporary email accounts that are valid for up to 24 hours.

Before using any disposable email account, you should make sure to read the service terms and conditions, as some services may sell your email address to third parties. It's always a good idea to use a disposable email account when you need to sign up for a service that requires you to provide your email address. By using a disposable email account, you can protect your email privacy and avoid spamming.

Disposable email accounts have many benefits
over a regular email account, but also some disadvantages. Disposable, or
temporary email accounts, come in all shapes and sizes with different features.
 
We’ll look at the best free disposable email
accounts that will get you online with a real email address in seconds that you
can use just like a regular email account.
 
## What Is a
Disposable Email Account?
 
Disposable email accounts aren’t permanent
ones like you’ll find with Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo, etc. They’re also usually
anonymous email accounts, meaning that you can sign up for one without giving
out your name, phone number, home address, etc.
 

 
You might use a throwaway email address if
you’re signing up for a user account that you will only use temporarily or that
you’re sure you won’t even need to read emails from. 
 
For example, you’ll want to avoid using a disposable address for your bank account because you might need bank statements or access to a recovery email should you forgot your password. 
 
However, if you’re trying out a service or planning on using a trial version of something, then a temporary email account will get you the email you need to complete the initial sign up process, and then you can forget about it completely (i.e., forget the email address and not write down the password).
 
The ideal is that you can use a “fake” email address if you don’t want to give out your real one. Avoid spam, sign up for something quickly, correspond with someone temporarily, steer clear from data breaches against your primary account, etc. If not for any other reason, just try a disposable email account to see how they work; you’ll probably find a few reasons to use one.
 
However, keep in mind that unlike a “normal” email service, disposable/temporary email accounts don’t usually have advanced features like the ability to see when someone has read your email, move emails to folders based on rules, save contacts, export messages, create fun signatures, and often even send email (most only let you receive them).
 
Important: To reiterate — it’s not recommended to keep temporary email addresses as your primary means of receiving email from important websites. You should use a secure account that only you can access, such as a private email service.
 
## Best Throwaway
Email Accounts
 
There are several services that offer
temporary email addresses. These are the absolute best:
 
- 10 Minute Mail: Random email addresses that expires in ten minutes unless you ask for more time.MailDrop: Choose your own email addresses or get one that’s been generated randomly, and return to the inbox whenever you want.EmailOnDeck: Send anonymous emails to other EmailOnDeck users, receive messages from any email address. Accounts expire after several hours.Guerrilla Mail: Send emails (and attachments) to any address, receive emails from any address, scramble your email address, delete specific emails, choose your own username (the part before “@”), and pick from a selection of domains (the section after “@”).ThrowAwayMail.com: Short, throwaway email addresses that last two days.

 
## How to Use Them
 
Let’s walk through a couple of these services
to get a feel for how they work.
 
10 Minute Mail is easy to remember and should
be a go-to if you often need temporary, expiring email addresses. The moment
you open the website, you’re redirected to an email address with a 10-minute
countdown until it expires, after which the emails and account itself is no
longer accessible.
 
There’s a copy button to quickly copy the
email address you’re given, and a refresh button to reset the time back to 10
minutes should you need it. You can refresh the timer as often as you want but
if you leave the page and forget to refresh, you can’t get your emails back
again; you’ll instead receive a brand new address with another countdown to its expiration.
 
MailDrop is a little different than 10 Minute
Mail for the primary reason that there isn’t a countdown until the email
account expires. You can also make your own username for the email address
instead of being stuck with the random, often long username that accompanies 10
Minute Mail addresses — type a username in the box provided on the website and
select GO to instantly access your
new inbox.
 
Something else rather unique about MailDrop is
that instead of erasing all the emails when a time limit is reached, the
messages remain on the email account, seemingly forever. For example, when you
choose your username, you’ll open that specific MailDrop account which might
already have messages in it.
 
MailDrop also gives out an alias address that
is different than the MailDrop one but still delivers messages to the primary
inbox. This is useful if you don’t want to give out your already-anonymous
email address!
 
What’s more is that with the MailDrop disposable email service, you can choose literally any username when you’re asked for your email address on another website, and then go to MailDrop.cc, enter the username you already chose, and see the messages. 
 
Try it yourself: pick a random username like 1234box, and then type it after the https://maildrop.cc/inbox/ URL, like this: https://maildrop.cc/inbox/1234box.
