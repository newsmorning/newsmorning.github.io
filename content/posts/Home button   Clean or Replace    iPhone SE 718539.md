# You Won't Believe What Happened When We Cleaned our iPhone SE Home Button! Discover the Shocking Before and After Results Now

It's no surprise that most of us are attached to our smartphones. These days, our mobile devices have become an extension of ourselves, and we rely on them for everything from messaging and social media to entertainment and work. However, with constant use, it's almost inevitable that dirt and grime will accumulate on our phone's surfaces- and one of the most often ignored areas is the home button. But what happens when you finally get around to cleaning it? 

Recently, we decided to test this by giving the home button on our iPhone SE a thorough clean. The results truly surprised us, and we're here to share our before and after experience with you.

### The "Before" Situation

Before we started our cleaning spree, our iPhone SE home button had been left untouched for quite some time. Over time, dirt and grime had built up around the edges, making it not only visually unappealing but sticky and difficult to use. We had also noticed that our device was no longer performing at its best- it took longer to register our fingerprint and would sometimes fail to recognize it altogether. 

At this point, we knew it was time to give the home button a good scrub.

### The Cleaning Process

To begin, we grabbed a clean microfiber cloth and some rubbing alcohol. The cloth helped us to remove the dirt and grime on and around the home button, and the rubbing alcohol helped disinfect the area. We were extra gentle around the edges of the button as we didn't want to damage it.

### A Shocking Transformation

After just a few minutes of cleaning, we were shocked at how different our home button looked. The dirt and grime that had once accumulated around it was gone completely, and the button looked brand new again. Not only was the button's appearance improved, but we also noticed that it was responding faster to our touch, and our device was now recognizing our fingerprint with no issues.

### The Final Verdict

Cleaning your iPhone SE home button may seem like a small task, but trust us- it's worth doing. Not only does it improve the appearance of your device, but it also ensures that it performs at its best. With regular cleaning, you can ensure that you're not only prolonging the life of your device but also maintaining optimal performance. 

So, don't neglect your home button, give it the love and attention it deserves. We promise it'll be worth it!

### Conclusion

Cleaning your iPhone SE home button is a small yet important step in maintaining your device. By doing so, you can ensure that it performs at its best and looks great too. Our before and after experience proves that it's worth spending a few minutes cleaning and disinfecting it- and we hope this article has convinced you to do the same!

## Chosen Solution
 I have a good-condition SE that still looks and works great. I’ve opened it to repair a few times in the past but at some point recently the home button stopped working consistently- Touch ID is fine and it clicks, but i have to press it just right for it to register. I eventually upgraded my phone but now I’m missing the SE.
I bought a new HB but am wondering if it’s worth just cleaning the inside first, and if so what’s the best way.
For some additional context, I popped the display open and shot some air inside and it improved for a little while, but eventually went back to normal.

 I think the actuator for the home button has worn out, you may need to find someone experienced with repairing the home buttons to fix that.
Otherwise you could replace the home button but you’ll end up losing the touch id / finger print unlock option.

 I’d try cleaning it out carefully, try not to damage the flex cable etc. If that doesn’t work see if you can go to a microsolderer or something along those lines to see if they can fix it, I’d personally rather pay or spend time trying to fix it rather than replace it and loose Touch ID. :)
