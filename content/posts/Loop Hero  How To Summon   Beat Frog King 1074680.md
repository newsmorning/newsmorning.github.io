# Unleash Your Inner Hero: Learn How to Summon and Conquer the Mighty Frog King in Loop Hero!

In the world of Loop Hero, there are many strong opponents that you can face. One of the most powerful enemies is the Frog King. This creature is a true challenge for any hero, but with the right strategy, you can defeat him and reap the rewards. In this article, we will give you some tips on how to summon the Frog King and conquer him in battle!

## Summoning the Frog King

The Frog King can only be summoned in the Swamp biome. To create this biome, you need to place Meadow and Thickets cards next to each other. The Swamp biome will then appear on the loop, and you will start to encounter different creatures that live there.

To summon the Frog King, you need to stack three Swamp-specific cards on top of each other. These cards are the Battlefields, Battlefield Meadows, and Mosquito Swarm. Once you have placed these three cards in succession, the Frog King will appear.

## Preparing to Fight the Frog King

Before you take on the Frog King, you need to make sure your hero is fully prepared. The Frog King is a tough opponent, so you need to be at your best. Here are some things you can do to prepare for the battle:

- Equip your hero with the best weapons and armor you have.
- Ensure that your hero's traits are optimized for the upcoming battle. For example, the Vampirism trait is useful as it allows your hero to steal health from enemies.
- Place useful cards on the loop, such as Vampire Mansions, Blood Groves or Temporal Beacons to help your hero deal with the Frog King.
- Build up your resource reserves through battles with other enemies or by placing resource-generating cards on the loop.

## Fighting the Frog King

The Frog King is a formidable opponent, but if you follow these tips, you should be able to overcome him.

- Let the enemies summoned by the Mosquito Swarm card spawn, and take them out before you attack the Frog King. This way, you will have fewer distractions during the boss fight.
- The Frog King attacks using ranged attacks, so try to get behind him to avoid most of his damage.
- The Frog King also spawns minions, so try to take them out before attacking the boss.
- Use your hero's special abilities and skills to gain the upper hand. For example, the Necromancer skill can summon skeletons to fight on your side, while the Dancer ability can stun enemies.
- Use resource-generating cards to earn resources during the battle. This can help you heal or use special abilities.

## Rewards for Conquering the Frog King

If you successfully defeat the Frog King in battle, you will receive several rewards. You will get a lot of resources as well as a legendary item. The legendary item can be used to give your hero an additional trait, making him or her even more powerful.

## Conclusion

Summoning and defeating the Frog King is a significant challenge in Loop Hero, but with the right strategy, you can conquer him and reap the rewards. Remember to use the tips we have given you and prepare for battle before you face the Frog King. Good luck, hero!

## How to Summon Frog King in Loop Hero?
 
To summon the Frog King in Loop Hero, you need to keep Swamp tiles over all the loop road tiles. The basic idea is to cover your loop with Swamp Tiles. Once you covered the entire loop with Swamp cards, the Frog King will appear for you.  Then he will show up in your loop as a small frog sprite. Once you approach him, he will speak in the same language as the fisherman. As easy as the summoning process is, do not expect the main boss battle to be similarly easy.
 

 
## How to Beat Frog King in Loop Hero?
 
As soon as the boss is summoned, you will find that he has just 2 HP. But he has a special ability called Steel Flesh where all of your damage will be reduced to 1 HP hit for him. Frog King also has a high evasion value of 99.9%. His attacks won’t be highly damaging but after the whole swamp loop, your resources will be considerably low to fight this boss.
 
The best way to go about this to plan attacks that will happen twice in a row to deal 1 HP damage each to kill him in one turn. So the best option is to have an ally fighting along with you and equip high attack speed. So the best hero class to face this boss is the Rogue. Rogue will need to have high attack speed along with a wolf companion to attack the boss twice before he deals any damage at all.
