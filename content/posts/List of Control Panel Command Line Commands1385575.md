# You Won't Believe These Command Line Secrets Hidden In Your Control Panel - The Ultimate List!

Are you tired of navigating through your computer's GUI every time you want to execute a command or perform a task? Do you want to explore the power of the command line interface but don't know where to start? Fear not, because in this article, we will reveal some of the most incredible command line secrets hidden in your control panel to help you streamline your workflow and increase your productivity!

## 1. Remote Desktop Connection

Did you know that you can establish a remote desktop connection from your command line interface? It's true! Simply type "mstsc" into your command prompt, and a remote desktop connection window will pop up, allowing you to connect to any computer on your network with ease.

## 2. Task Scheduler

Task Scheduler is a powerful tool that allows you to automate tasks and run them at specific intervals. But did you know that you can create and manage tasks from your command line interface? Simply type "taskschd.msc" into your command prompt, and the Task Scheduler window will appear, allowing you to create, modify, and delete tasks.

## 3. System Configuration

If you're experiencing performance issues with your computer, you may want to modify its startup settings to optimize it for your needs. You can access the System Configuration tool from your command line interface by typing "msconfig." Once the window appears, you can select the Startup tab to enable or disable startup programs and services, among other things.

## 4. Windows Firewall

If you want to quickly enable or disable your Windows Firewall, you can do so from your command line interface! To enable the firewall, simply type "netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on," and to disable it, type "netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off." This can come in handy if you frequently switch between private and public networks.

## 5. Text-To-Speech

Did you know that your computer can speak to you? With the Text-to-Speech tool, you can listen to any text on your computer spoken out loud. To access this tool from your command line interface, type "Narrator" or "Narrator.exe."

## 6. Disk Cleanup

If you want to free up some space on your hard disk, the Disk Cleanup tool is the perfect solution. You can access this tool from your command line interface by typing "cleanmgr." Once the window appears, you can select the disk to clean up and the files to remove, among other things.

## 7. Power Configuration

If you want to customize your computer's power settings, you can access the Power Configuration tool from your command line interface. Simply type "powercfg.cpl" into your command prompt, and the Power Configuration window will appear, allowing you to modify your computer's power plan settings and more.

## 8. Services

If you want to manage the services running on your computer, you can do so from your command line interface. To access the Services tool, type "services.msc" into your command prompt. Once the window appears, you can start, stop, or modify any service running on your computer.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the command line interface is a powerful tool that can help you increase your productivity and streamline your workflow. With these command line secrets hidden in your control panel, you can perform tasks and execute commands with ease, without having to navigate through your computer's GUI. So, start exploring the power of the command line interface today and see what else you can discover!

Did you know that each Control Panel applet in Windows can be opened by executing a specific command? It's true! You just have to know what that command is.

 
##   When to Open an Applet From a Command Line  
 

Sometimes it's easier, or maybe even in some cases necessary, to open an applet in the Control Panel from a command line in Windows. For example, if you're building a script or software program that needs to open an applet, these little tricks help.

 

More common, however, is a situation where your computer is misbehaving in a certain way that prevents you from navigating around like usual, leaving you with no way to open Control Panel normally, which you likely need to do to solve the issue! Frustrating, we know.

 

Often times, however, these situations still allow the execution of a command. That's where it's very handy to have the list of Control Panel command line tricks shown in the giant table below.

 
##   Open the Command Prompt  
 

Start by opening Command Prompt, or even just the Run box (WIN+R keyboard shortcut). Once open, execute, exactly as shown below, the command that corresponds with the Control Panel applet you want to open. It's as easy as that.

 
##   How to Open the Control Panel  
 

Maybe you don't want to open a specific Control Panel applet from Command Prompt, or the Run box, but instead you want Control Panel itself to open...the Control Panel "home page" so to speak.

 
See our List of Control Panel Applets in Windows for Control Panel applet descriptions and information about changes in applets between the Windows operating systems.
 

This is as easy as executing control from a command line in any version of Windows. Don't add anything after it—just control by itself.

 

Control Panel will open just as it does when you do all the clicking or tapping you usually do to open it normally.

 
##   Control Panel Command Line Commands in Windows  
 

CMD Commands for Control Panel Applets

 

[1] Color isn't available by default but is available for free from Microsoft. You can grab a copy from MajorGeeks.

 

[2] WinColor.exe must be run from the C:\Program Files\Pro Imaging Powertoys\Microsoft Color Control Panel Applet for Windows XP folder.

 

[3] I've listed Device Manager here because it's such a commonly used feature of Windows but please know that it is not a true Control Panel applet in Windows XP. See How to Open Windows XP Device Manager for more information.

 

[4] The Mail applet is only available if a version of Microsoft Office Outlook is installed.

 

[5] The control mlcfg32.cpl command must be run from the C:\Programs Files\Microsoft Office\OfficeXX folder, replacing OfficeXX with the folder pertaining to the Microsoft Office version you have installed.

 

[6] ODBC Data Source Administrator was removed from Control Panel after Windows XP but is still available from Administrative Tools.

 

[7] In Windows 8, 7, and Vista, task scheduling is performed by Task Scheduler which is not directly accessible from Control Panel. However, executing this command in those versions of Windows will forward to Task Scheduler.

 

[8] Software Explorers is the name for the Control Panel applet for Windows Defender, available for free here as part of Microsoft Security Essentials.

 

[9] Msascui.exe must be run from the C:\Program Files\Windows Defender folder.

 

[10] The control sapi.cpl command must be run from the C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Speech folder.

 

[11] Windows Defender is available in Windows XP but the Control Panel applet is instead called Software Explorers.

 

[12] Windows Update is also used in Windows XP but only via the Windows Update website, not via a Control Panel applet like in later versions of Windows.

 

[13] In Windows 8, bthprops.cpl opens Devices in PC Settings which will list any Bluetooth Devices. In Windows 7, bthprops.cpl opens the Bluetooth Devices list under Devices and Printers. In Windows Vista, bthprops.cpl opens a true Control Panel applet called Bluetooth Devices.
