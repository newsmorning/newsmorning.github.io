Are you tired of constantly deleting files on your computer to make room for new ones? Do you wish there was an easy and affordable solution to expanding your computer's storage capacity? Look no further than the simple and versatile SATA to USB adapter cable.

This small but mighty cable allows you to connect internal hard drives, solid-state drives, and optical drives to your computer via USB. This means you can add terabytes of storage space to your computer without having to replace your current hard drive or invest in expensive external hard drives.

The SATA to USB adapter cable is incredibly easy to use. Simply plug one end of the cable into the SATA port on your drive and the other end into one of your computer's USB ports. Your computer will recognize the drive as an external hard drive, and you can begin storing files on it immediately.

Not only does this cable provide added storage space, but it also allows you to repurpose old internal hard drives and solid-state drives from previous computers or laptops. This is a great way to save money and reduce waste by extending the life of older technology.

The SATA to USB adapter cable is also great for data recovery. If you have a damaged computer that won't start up, you can use this cable to connect the internal hard drive to another computer and retrieve your important files.

Overall, the SATA to USB adapter cable is a game-changer for anyone in need of additional storage space or looking to repurpose old drives. It is easy to use, affordable, and versatile. So don't settle for constantly deleting files to free up space on your computer - invest in a SATA to USB adapter cable and revolutionize your storage capabilities!

## Chosen Solution
 Wondering if there is an adapter cable that can be hooked into firewire or USB to power-up and read an external SATA drive (one removed from another failed PowerBook or MacBook for data recovery)
Perhaps a pin-out diagram to make one up would do.

 what you're looking for is one of these universal USB 2.0 drive adapters - you can find other manufacturers too, not just this particular brand
FAR more versatile than an external firewire enclosure. a must-have tool for anyone who often takes apart computers and needs to transfer data between drives.  - inexpensive and can interface to many different kinds and physical sizes of drives.

 You need a hard drive enclosure, you cant just connect it straight to the firewire port as there is complex circuitry involved. You can find one here

 Thanks everyone, I think the question is answered.
Merry Christmas to all... I'll see if there is still time for Santa to dredge up an adapter cable for me.

 Ok... Thanks for the info. However, are you sure this will work for a HD from a MacBook? The HD is a Seagate Momentus 5400.3 120GB. I bought a similar adapter, a Vantec, and the connectors did not fit the HD. Has anyone used the product on the link above for a Mac Laptop HD?
