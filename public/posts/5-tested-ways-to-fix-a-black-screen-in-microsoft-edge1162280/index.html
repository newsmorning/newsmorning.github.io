If you’re an avid user of Microsoft Edge, you might have experienced a frustrating issue where the browser displays endless black screens, making your browsing experience feel like a nightmare.

Here’s how they did it.\nThe Problem Before we dive into the solution, let’s take a closer look at the black screen issue that has been causing headaches for Edge users. The black screen problem occurs when users try to launch Edge or open a new tab. Instead of displaying the page, the screen turns black, making it impossible to do anything.\nThe Solution The Edge Monkeys found that the black screen issue was caused by a conflict between Edge’s GPU and the rendering engine. To fix the problem, they created a patch that disables the GPU rendering and forces Edge to use the CPU rendering instead. This hack may sound simple, but it proved to be an effective solution to the black screen issue.\nTo apply the patch, follow these steps:\nClose all instances of Edge. Download the patch from The Edge Monkeys’ website. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on your computer. Right-click on the “black_screen_patch.bat” file and select “Run as administrator.” Wait for the patch to be applied. You will see a “success” message once it’s done. After applying the patch, launch Edge and open a new tab. You should no longer see the black screen issue. The Edge Monkeys’ patch has been tested on different systems and it proved to be a reliable solution to the problem.\nConclusion If you’re a frustrated Edge user who’s tired of dealing with endless black screens, The Edge Monkeys’ patch might just be the solution you’ve been looking for. While Microsoft is still working on an official fix for the problem, this quick and easy hack offers a simple workaround that can save you a lot of time and frustration.\nIt’s worth noting that The Edge Monkeys’ patch is an unofficial fix, so use it at your own risk.
