If you own a 2017 Toyota 4Runner, you probably know the convenience of the key fob. This nifty gadget allows you to lock or unlock doors, pop open the trunk and even start the car without inserting a key into the ignition. Unfortunately, like any electronic device, your key fob can start showing signs of wear and tear.

Finding out that your key fob isn't working is a frustrating experience, especially when you're in a hurry. Before you run to your nearest dealership and pay a hefty amount for a replacement, here are some easy tips to revive your 2017 Toyota 4Runner key fob.

## Replace the Battery

The battery in your 2017 Toyota 4Runner key fob can die over time, so the first thing you should do is to check if the battery needs replacement. A dead battery is the most common cause of a non-working key fob. Replacing the battery is an easy process and can be done in the following steps:

1. Locate the battery cover on the back of your key fob.
2. Use a small screwdriver to pry open the cover.
3. Remove the dead battery and replace it with a new CR2032 lithium battery (make sure the positive side of the battery is facing up).
4. Snap the cover back into place.

Replacing the battery usually solves the problem with a non-working key fob. However, if this doesn't work, you may need to try the following steps:

## Reprogram the Key Fob

If replacing the battery fails to solve the problem with your 2017 Toyota 4Runner key fob, you should try reprogramming it. Here are the steps to reprogram your key fob:

1. Sit in the driver's seat and lock all doors.
2. Insert and remove the key from the ignition twice within five seconds.
3. Close and open the driver's door twice within 40 seconds.
4. Insert the key into the ignition and close all doors.
5. Turn the key to the "on" position and then to the "off" position - this will confirm that you are in programming mode.
6. Remove the key and press any button on the key fob to complete the programming process.

Assuming you follow the steps correctly, you should be able to reprogram your key fob and start enjoying the convenience it offers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, if your 2017 Toyota 4Runner key fob has stopped working, don't panic! More likely than not, a dead battery is the cause of the issue. Simply replace the battery and your key fob should be back to life. If that doesn't do the job, try reprogramming your key fob following the above steps. In any case, these simple steps can help you avoid the high cost of key fob replacement and get you back on the road in no time.

## Introduction
 
A key fob is the small handheld remote control device that controls a remote keyless entry system of many new modern day vehicles including the 4Runner from Toyota.
 
To complete this process you will need a Lithium Cell CR1632 3 Volt Coin Battery and any flat head screwdriver.
 
Before beginning this process, if your battery isnâ€™t completely dead, make sure you are out of range from possibly turning your vehicle on and if you are in range, move far from range or just make sure you do not turn your vehicle on.
