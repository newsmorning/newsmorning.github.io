Title: Uncovering the Mystery of Samsung Galaxy S7’s WIFI Connection after an Abnormal Factory Reset

Introduction:

Samsung Galaxy S7 owners faced a perplexing issue after an abnormal factory reset which rendered their devices unable to connect to WIFI. The reason behind this problem bewildered many of them, and despite various attempts, the owners could not figure out the root of this problem. In this article, we will explain why the Samsung Galaxy S7 is unable to connect to WIFI after an abnormal factory reset and guide you on how to fix it.

Body:

The reason behind Samsung Galaxy S7’s WIFI connection issue after an abnormal factory reset is due to the device’s security protocol feature called the "FRP" (Factory Reset Protection). This feature is a security protocol introduced by Google and installed on all Android devices running on Android 5.1 or above to deter theft by rendering the device unusable after a factory reset.

The idea behind the FRP is for the device to ask for the previously associated Google Account credentials before it can be "activated." Hence, when a user resets the Samsung Galaxy S7 to its factory settings, the device will not work until the owner logs in with the Google account that was associated with the device before the factory reset. But, in some cases, a user might not know the Google account credentials associated with the device, making it impossible to log in and activate the device.

Typically, a user can enter the details associated with their Google account and proceed smoothly and activate the device. However, if this feature is bypassed via an abnormal factory reset, the device becomes locked, making it impossible for the owner to activate it. In such cases, the Samsung Galaxy S7 becomes unusable and unable to connect to any WIFI network.

However, don’t let this issue dampen your Samsung experience. There is a way to fix this problem. By using the Odin tool which is widely available on the internet, you can flash your device and restore it to its previous state. You can follow the following steps to resolve the WIFI connection issue on your Samsung Galaxy S7:

• Download the Odin tool from a trusted source 
• Launch the odin tool and attach your device to your computer using a USB cable 
• Click on the AP option 
• Select the firmware file from your downloaded folder 
• After selecting the firmware, click on the ‘’Start’’ button.

With these simple steps, your device will start flashing, and your Samsung Galaxy S7 will be restored to its factory settings. After this, you can activate your device again, and the WIFI connection should function correctly.

Conclusion:

The FRP feature is an essential security protocol that protects owners of Samsung Galaxy S7 devices from theft. It is important, however, to keep one’s credentials or have them set up correctly to ensure that, in case of a factory reset, owners can properly activate their devices. Using the Odin tool, owners can flash their devices and restore their Samsung Galaxy S7 devices to their previous state, enjoying the full functionality of the device. With proper sets of instructions, owners can recover their devices from previously unresolvable issues, creating peace of mind and the full enjoyment of their Samsung Galaxy S7.

## Chosen Solution
 My LCD stopped working and needed to be replaced. Before I knew what the problem was a tried a soft reset. I could hear my phone ring, it would vibrate, it would light up. Anyway, after LCD was replaced, turned the phone back on it takes me through the start up Welcome screen. I choose my language and it takes me to a screen that says set up wifi. Then I get the message
" Due to an abnormal reset, the selected Wi-Fi network cannot be used. Connect to a different wi-fi network. "
No matter what wifi network I try to connect to, I get the same message.  If I click the skip button it says
"Due to an abnormal factory reset, you will not be able to use this phone until you sign into your Google Account to confirm that it belongs to you. A network connection is required."
I have the google account information, however, I can't get to the sign in screen because it's not allowing me to connect to any network.
Additional information
1. I initially had Verizon with this account. I no longer live in the US so I don't have Verizon anymore.
2. I tried to sign in without a sim card, with a sim card from my current country, with a Verizon sim card from another phone that is currently activated - I get the same message with all.
HELP?!

 Why don’t you reset it again? Can you do it “the normal way”?

 I just had the same problem,  samsung support says i will have to send it to a samsung service center to reflash the software.  You have to first get a ticket created,  then send them proof of purchase, then they will send you a shipping label so you can send in the phone and wait for them to fix it and return it back to you. Unless you are near a samsung walk in service center.  Good luck

 I'm facing the same issue has anybody found a way around having to send it to  samsung?

 I was able to fix this by connecting to a completely open wifi hotspot (I used another phone) that had no username and password.

 If you go to the sign in page for the Samsung account type in your email address  then press and hold on it for a second or two let go and the copy.paste.cut options come up on the far right swipe left and the assistant option should be on the far right of them all press it press the Google logo when the Google page comes up press the first letter of what you want in the search bar ie s  for settings or C for chrome i for Internet you should be able to get someware by using this for whatever  your trying to accomplish.
Update (09/19/2020)
Go to the WiFi list scroll down to add network push 5 or 6 random letter's  then press and hold your finger on top of them for a second or two and let go you should see a row of boxes with copy.cut.and so forth but one should be the Google  assistant press it and then when the google search bar is showing touch it and then type in the letter “S” and the symbol for settings will appear  press it and scroll down  to accounts and sign in with the add accounts  option.
