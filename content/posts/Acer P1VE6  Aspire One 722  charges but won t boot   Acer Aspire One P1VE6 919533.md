Introduction

If you own an Acer laptop, you know how frustrating it can be when it won't start up. You might assume that the problem is with the hardware or the battery. But, there are many possible reasons why the laptop might not turn on. In this article, we will explore some of the common issues and provide possible solutions to fix the problem.

Possible reasons why your Acer laptop won't start up

1. Dead Battery: The most common reason a laptop won't start up is a dead battery. Often, we forget to charge our laptops and end up with a drained battery. If you haven't charged your laptop in a while, try plugging it into a power source and see if it starts up.

2. Loose or Damaged Power Cord: Another reason why your laptop may not start up is a loose or damaged power cord. Check the connection between the wall outlet, the power brick, and the laptop. If any of these are loose or damaged, replace them.

3. Faulty AC Adapter: If your AC adapter is faulty, your laptop won't start up. Try using a different adapter and see if the laptop boots.

4. Overheating: If your laptop has been running for a long time or is placed in an area with inadequate ventilation, it might overheat. In such a case, you need to let it cool down before you can use it again.

5. Corrupted Software: Sometimes, software or operating system glitches can prevent the laptop from starting up. You can try starting your laptop in safe mode to identify the issue.

Possible solutions to fix your Acer Laptop

1. Check the battery: If your laptop's battery is dead, charging it will solve the problem.

2. Check the power cord and adapter: If there is any damage or looseness, replace them. You can also try using a different adapter.

3. Remove external devices: Sometimes, external devices like USB drives or earphones can prevent the laptop from starting up. Remove all external devices and check if the laptop boots.

4. Let the laptop cool down: If your laptop is overheating, turn it off and let it cool down before restarting. It's also essential to place your laptop on a smooth, flat surface that allows proper ventilation.

5. Boot in Safe Mode: Starting your computer in Safe Mode can help you identify if any software is causing the issue. Press the F8 key while the computer boots up and select Safe Mode.

## Chosen Solution
 Some time ago my son spilled water on top of the closed Acer Aspire one 722-0473. The water rolled off the top and entered through the touchpad/speaker area. When I plug it in, the orange charging light comes on. When I press the power button, the blue power light comes on. It even stays on after I unplug the laptop (battery is charging). When I took everything apart, I did not see any visible corrosion, but it still won't boot.
Do I need a new motherboard?
P.S. The only change I made the the original system was upgrading the hard drive. I purchased official ACER recovery discs.
Update (02/10/2017)
Looking at the touchpad's logic board, it's got some discoloration under what looks like tape (which is holding cables on). Can I peel that off to clean under it?
Update (04/27/2017)
I swapped the motherboard out, and now it is working beautifully!

 @datnametakn , Stop charging and powering on the device. Even though you are not seeing corrosion it may be a good idea treat the board and all connections as if they had the corrosion/water on them (this way all connections,etc will be reseated well and clean). Disassemble the device Link #1 video for reference and a general guide Link #2 explaining drying/cleaning electronics that have experienced liquid damage.
Clean put back together and try. Good luck.
I hope this helped you out, if so let me know by pressing the helpful button.
