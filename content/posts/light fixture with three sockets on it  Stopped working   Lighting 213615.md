Title: SHOCKING! Three Socket Light Fixture Goes BLACK OUT! Discover the Reason Behind This Unbelievable Lighting Mystery!

Have you ever experienced a sudden black out of your three socket light fixture at home or office? If yes, then you might know how frustrating it could be to deal with this lighting problem. The worst part is that sometimes you don't even know the reason behind the sudden black out. But, don't worry as in this article we're going to reveal some of the most common reasons behind the three socket light fixture black out.

Reason 1: Faulty Wiring

The most common reason behind the black out of three socket light fixture is faulty wiring. If the wiring of your light fixture is damaged, loose or not connected properly, then it can cause the entire fixture to go black out. Make sure to hire a professional electrician who can inspect the wiring of your fixture and repair it if needed.

Reason 2: Overloaded Circuit

Another common reason behind the black out of three socket light fixture is the overloaded circuit. If you're using too many appliances or devices on the same circuit, then it can cause the circuit to overload and trip the circuit breaker. As a result, your light fixture may go black out along with other appliances that were connected to the same circuit. 

To avoid this problem, make sure to spread your appliances and devices on different circuits or use a power strip that comes with its circuit breaker.

Reason 3: Burnt Out Bulbs

Sometimes the reason behind the black out of three socket light fixture is as simple as a burnt out bulb. If you notice that only one or two bulbs are not working and the rest of the fixture is working perfectly fine, then chances are that the bulbs are burnt out. Replace the burnt out bulbs with new ones, and your fixture will start working again.

Conclusion

The three socket light fixture black out can be frustrating, especially when you don't know the reason behind it. However, now that you know the most common reasons behind the black out, you can easily identify the problem and fix it as soon as possible. Remember to always seek the help of a professional electrician if you're not confident in troubleshooting the issue yourself.

## Chosen Solution
 Not sure if it’s bad edicate to write on this post but when I went to post a new message I couldn’t figure out what “device” to pick.
I have a light fixture with three sockets on it.  Stopped working but I can tell voltage is still going to it.  When I put a volt meter with the black wire to the side and the red wire to the center where the  back of the bulb hits, two of them report about 119.5 volts.  The third returns 0L.  If I move the red wire off the pad a bit lower it shows an acceptable voltage but right on the pad where the back of the bulb hits it does that.  Any ideas?  Does that one socket just need replacing?

 Hi @jriker1
Post an image of the fixture so it can be seen.
Here's how to do this on ifixit. Adding images to an existing question.
Have you checked the wiring to the light switch from the light fitting?
If you’re getting 120V on the wire back from the light switch but not on the socket then there may be a open circuit connection in the socket terminal
Usually power, active and neutral and earth is supplied to the light fitting and is then multipled to other light fittings, but the power to light the bulbs comes via the light switch. Only the active (red) is switched however. The neutral (black) is always connected to the bulbs.
Here’s an image that show how it is wired. Brown = Red and Blue = Black  as the new standard is Brown for active, Blue for neutral and Green/Yellow for earth

If you are getting power from the light switch and the neutral is connected OK to the bulbs then there is a problem in the socket. Remove the fuse or trip the circuit breaker for the lights, and then disconnect the wires (remember which ones go where) from the terminals and test the socket connections for continuity with an Ohmmeter.
Alternatively with the power still totally disconnected, if it is an Edison screw socket and they are spring tensioned type tab connectors prise them up a bit as they may not be exerting enough tension on the bulb connectors when the bulb is screwed in.
