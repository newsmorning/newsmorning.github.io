I recently decided to replace the battery in my trusty iPod Classic, which had started to lose its charge after years of use. I ordered a replacement battery online and eagerly awaited its arrival.

When the battery arrived, I was excited to get to work. I carefully followed the instructions, opening up my iPod and removing the old battery. It was a bit tricky, but I managed to get it out without damaging anything.

I then inserted the new battery and reattached all the cables and connectors. Everything seemed to be going smoothly until I tried to put the iPod back together.

To my surprise, the lid wouldn't fit! I tried everything I could think of to get it to close, but it just wouldn't budge. I was completely baffled - I had followed the instructions exactly, so what could possibly be the problem?

After some careful investigation, I discovered that the new battery was ever so slightly thicker than the original battery. This meant that the lid, which had been designed to fit snugly over the old battery, now had a gap that was just a fraction too small.

I was frustrated, but determined to find a solution. After some trial and error, I discovered that by bending the metal clips that held the battery in place, I could create just enough extra space for the lid to fit.

It wasn't a perfect solution, but it worked. My iPod Classic was back in action, with a new battery that would last for many more years. I was relieved and grateful to have been able to fix the problem, but also a bit surprised and disappointed that something as seemingly simple as replacing a battery could cause such a headache.

In conclusion, if you are thinking about replacing the battery in your iPod Classic, be prepared for the possibility that the lid might not fit perfectly. However, with a bit of patience and creativity, you can find a way to make it work. Good luck!

## Chosen Solution
 We have the Late 2008 (7th Gen) 160gb version.  We installed the correct ifixit battery thick, as only devices from 2009 are thin.
However, when putting the housing together it will not go all the way down at the top.
Anyone else ran into this?

 It looks like you got a battery for the 160gb thick model from 2007 (6th gen), and yours might be 2009 model (7th gen) is slimmer. You need to check which model you have by pasting your iPod's serial number on this site: http://www.chipmunk.nl/klantenservice/ap.... It'll show you info about your iPod's production date and generation, from which you can tell which model is it.
