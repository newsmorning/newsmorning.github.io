## Chosen Solution
 The phone suddenly began to come and go as standby if the power button was constantly pressed . In fact, it notes that the button sensitivity is greatly increased , but it is impossible to use it !!! And by the way you can not shut down because after a while it turn on alone !!!!  Any idea what can be and how to proceed??

 I know it's way too late but I had this problem too & it stopped when I replaced the battery.
