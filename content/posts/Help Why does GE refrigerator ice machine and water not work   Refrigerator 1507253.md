# Owners Beware! GE Refrigerator Ice Machine & Water Dispenser Fail â€“ Here's WHY ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

If you own a GE refrigerator with a built-in ice machine and water dispenser, you may have experienced some issues with these features failing to work properly. This can be frustrating and inconvenient, especially if you rely heavily on these functions in your daily routine. In this article, we will explore some of the common reasons for these failures and what you can do to prevent them from happening in the future.

## Mechanical Issues

One of the most common issues that can cause your GE ice machine and water dispenser to fail is a mechanical problem. This can range from a simple component failure to a more complex issue, such as a broken motor or compressor. If you are experiencing issues with your ice machine or water dispenser, it is important to first check for any mechanical issues. If you are not comfortable with diagnosing and fixing these types of problems yourself, it is always best to contact a professional repair technician.

## Frozen Water Line

Another common reason for GE refrigerator ice machine and water dispenser failures is a frozen water line. When the water line becomes frozen, it can prevent the water from flowing properly, which can cause your ice machine to stop making ice and your water dispenser to stop working. To prevent this from happening, it is important to regularly clean your refrigerator's water line and check for any signs of freezing or blockage.

## Clogged Filters

Your GE refrigerator's ice machine and water dispenser rely on a filter to ensure that the water that is dispensed is clean and contaminant-free. If these filters become clogged or dirty, they can cause your ice machine and water dispenser to stop working. To prevent this from happening, it is important to regularly replace your filters according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

## Low Water Pressure

If you are experiencing issues with your GE refrigerator's ice machine and water dispenser, it is also possible that the cause could be low water pressure. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a clogged water line or a malfunctioning water valve. To prevent this from happening, it is important to regularly check your water pressure and keep your water line clear of any debris.

In conclusion, there are several common reasons for GE refrigerator ice machine and water dispenser failures, including mechanical issues, frozen water lines, clogged filters, and low water pressure. By taking steps to prevent these issues from occurring, you can ensure that your refrigerator's ice machine and water dispenser continue to work properly for years to come. And if you do experience any issues, it is always best to consult with a professional repair technician to ensure that the problem is properly diagnosed and fixed.

## Chosen Solution
 GE GFE29HSDHSS refrigerator upper ice machine is not working and water does not dispense. Lower ice maker works fine, but freezer light does not come on. Checked freezer door switch and all is good there. Lights come on in refrigerator and when door switches are depressed they go off. Everything is cooling fine as desired. Tried the lock and light button for reset, as well as unplugged fridge to try and reset. Neither worked. On display, it also doesnâ€™t show upper ice machine as an option to turn on and off like it once did. Just seems weird that bottom makes ice and top doesnâ€™t. All buttons work on front, including the dispense lever and light even comes on, but no ice or water. Also took out the filter and put in the bypass plug to see if that would help and it did not.
