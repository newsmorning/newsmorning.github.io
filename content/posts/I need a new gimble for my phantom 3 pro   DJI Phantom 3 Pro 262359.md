## Chosen Solution
 I’m buying a used pro 3 but it won’t feed video to cell phone.   He says it needs a new gimble mainboard—do you carry these?

 Hi
I don’t think iFixit carries these parts unfortunately
However you could probably find one on eBay or AliExpress for a reasonable price
Hopefully this helps
Any questions please ask
Thanks:-)
