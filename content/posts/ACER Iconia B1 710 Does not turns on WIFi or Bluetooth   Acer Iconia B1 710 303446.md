Introduction: 

The Acer Iconia B1 710 is a popular tablet that has been around for quite some time now. It is known for its affordability, portability, and impressive battery life. However, one of the most common issues that users face is trouble connecting to WiFi or Bluetooth. The good news is that this problem is not as big as it seems and can be easily fixed. In this article, we will discuss the surprising solution to this problem.

Body: 

1. Check if the WiFi/Bluetooth is turned on

The very first step you should take is to check if both the WiFi and Bluetooth are turned on. You can easily do this by going to the settings of your Acer Iconia B1 710 and checking the WiFi and Bluetooth icons. If they are turned off, simply turn them on and try connecting again.

2. Forget and re-connect to the network

Sometimes, the connection problem can arise due to a glitch in the system. To fix this, you can try forgetting the network and then connecting to it again. To forget a network, go to your Wi-Fi settings, tap on the network you want to connect to, and tap "Forget". Then, try reconnecting to the network.

3. Check for updates

It is also essential to keep your device updated. Sometimes the issue can be that the system is not up-to-date. You can simply connect your device to WiFi, go to the settings, and check for any available updates. If there is an update available, install it and try connecting again.

Tap on it and try connecting to the network again.

5. Factory Reset

If you have tried all the above steps and are still facing issues connecting to WiFi or Bluetooth, then a factory reset may be your last resort. It is important to note that a factory reset will erase all data and settings on your device. So, before doing a factory reset, make sure to back up all essential data. 

To do a factory reset, go to the settings, tap on "Backup & reset" and then tap on "Factory data reset". Follow the instructions and wait for the device to reset. After it resets, set up your device again and try connecting to your WiFi or Bluetooth.
