## Chosen Solution
 home button does not work

 I would change the digitizer assembly first, the button is part of that and if you broke the glass(i see this ALL the time being I go to high school), this will also fix that too
I would also check the spring under the home button, it is a piece of metal and it is shaped like a Z, that could of broke, but unlikley
