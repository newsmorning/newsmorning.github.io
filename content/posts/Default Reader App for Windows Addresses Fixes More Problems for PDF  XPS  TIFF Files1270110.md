# You Won't Believe How the New Default Reader App for Windows is Changing the Game for PDF, XPS, and TIFF Files!

If you're a Windows user, you're probably familiar with the built-in Reader app that comes with the operating system. For years, it has been the go-to application for opening and reading PDF, XPS, and TIFF files. But did you know that Microsoft recently released a new version of the app that promises to change the game for these popular file formats?

The new Reader app, which is available for free on the Microsoft Store, introduces several new features and improvements that make it stand out from its predecessors. Let's take a closer look at what's new and how it's changing the way we interact with PDF, XPS, and TIFF files.

## A Modern Look and Feel

One of the first things you'll notice about the new Reader app is its clean and modern interface. The app has been completely redesigned with a focus on simplicity and usability. The UI elements are streamlined and intuitive, making it easier to navigate through your documents and find the tools you need.

The app also supports touch and pen input, which is great news for users who own a touchscreen or a Surface device. You can now use your finger or stylus to annotate, highlight, and draw on your PDFs, XPS, and TIFF files. The handwriting recognition engine has been updated as well, which means that your handwritten notes and comments will be more accurate and legible than ever before.

## Improved Reading Experience

Reading on the new Reader app is a joy. The app supports a split view mode, which allows you to read two pages side by side, just like you would with a physical book. You can also customize the reading view by adjusting the font size, color, and background. If you prefer to read at night, you can enable the dark mode, which turns the background to black and the text to white.

The app also comes with a new feature called "Reading Progress," which shows you how far you've progressed through a document. This is particularly useful for longer PDFs and XPS files, where you may want to take breaks and resume reading later.

## Advanced Editing and Sharing Tools

The new Reader app is not just a reader; it's also a powerful editor and sharing tool. You can now edit the content of your PDFs and XPS files directly from the app, without needing to install any additional software. You can add or remove pages, change the order of pages, crop, rotate, and even sign your documents digitally.

Sharing your documents has never been easier either. The app allows you to share your document via email, OneDrive, or any other cloud storage service. You can also print your documents directly from the app or save them as a PDF or XPS file.

## Conclusion

The new Reader app for Windows is a game-changer for anyone who works with PDF, XPS, and TIFF files. The app's modern interface, improved reading experience, and advanced editing and sharing tools make it a must-have application for anyone who wants to be productive and efficient. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone who likes to read, the new Reader app is definitely worth checking out.
