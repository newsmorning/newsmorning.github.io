# SHOCKING! Volkswagen Beetle Owners Beware: Hi Beam Headlights FLASH but WON'T STAY ON - Find Out Why!

Volkswagen Beetle owners are facing a strange issue with their hi-beam headlights. While trying to activate hi-beam headlights, they might find that the headlights flash momentarily but do not stay on. The issue might appear random and unexpected, and might not be linked to any other problem with the vehicle.

## The Symptom

The issue with the hi-beam headlights can occur without warning, and might be particularly frustrating for drivers who rely on their headlights for a clear view of the road. When a driver tries to activate the hi-beam headlights, instead of the lights staying on continuously, they flash and then immediately turn off. This problem can happen on either high or low beams and can occur on both older and newer models of Volkswagen Beetles.

## The Cause

The problem might happen due to a malfunctioning turn-signal switch. The turn-signal switch is responsible for turning on the headlights and controlling other functions of the vehicle's lighting system. If this switch is faulty or damaged, it might interrupt the proper functioning of the lighting system and cause flickering headlights.

Moreover, it is natural for the contacts of the turn signal switch to wear out over time. The contacts might develop a carbon buildup or oxidation that creates resistance, making it difficult for the circuit to remain closed, resulting in flickering headlights.

## The Solution

If you are experiencing this issue with your Volkswagen Beetle, one of the solutions is to try to replace the turn-signal switch. However, before replacing the switch, it is important to diagnose the problem as this might not always be the case. Moreover, replacing the turn-signal switch on your own can be a complicated task, so it's better to leave it to a professional technician.

Another option would be to clean the switch contacts with an electrical contact cleaner that can remove buildup or oxidation. You can do this by spraying contact cleaner directly into the turn signal switch or on a cotton swab and then gently wiping the contacts. Allow the switch to dry for a few minutes, and then reconnect it to the car battery to see if it has solved the problem.

## Conclusion

If you are a Volkswagen Beetle owner experiencing issues with flickering hi-beam headlights, it's important to get it diagnosed and fixed quickly. This issue can pose a significant driving hazard, especially during nighttime driving or severe weather conditions. Some regular checks during routine vehicle maintenance can prevent this issue and ensure your safety on the road. It's advisable to seek professional help in such cases for an accurate diagnosis and solution. Be safe and drive carefully!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi Everyone,
I have a VW New Beetle 2002 and replaced  with new the Indicator/High Beam Stalk Switch as the old one was faulty and didn't lock in (when pushed back) for high beam light and hi beam lights didn't work.
Now high beam lights only flash when switch pulled forward but nothing happens when pushed back for hi-beam lights to stay permanently on?
Is it a relay or something else?
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Steve

 I would check the fuse if that's OK go for the relay swop it for another one if it works you then know, a lot of the relays can be swopped over !
