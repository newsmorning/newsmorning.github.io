Title: You Won't BELIEVE the Insane iPad 3 Hack to Fix a Broken Home Button - Just JUMP the 2 Prongs and it Works like MAGIC!

Introduction:

The iPad 3 is a popular device used for various purposes like watching movies, browsing the internet, and even work. However, one major problem that many users face is a broken home button. It can be frustrating when you can't go back to the home screen or switch between apps without using the home button. Fortunately, there is a hack that you can do to fix the home button and continue using the device like nothing happened. This article will explain the simple iPad 3 hack to fix a broken home button.

Body:

The first step in fixing a broken home button is to determine the problem. If the button is stuck, there might be something underneath it that's preventing it from working correctly. If the button isn't clicking, it might have become disconnected from the logic board. Either way, the hack to fix it is relatively simple.

First, you need to remove the screen protector and then the screws holding the digitizer in place. Next, gently lift the digitizer and detach the four cables connecting it to the logic board. Underneath the last cable, there are two gold prongs that are responsible for the home button's functionality. Using a metal tool, you can "jump" these two prongs to connect them and fix the home button.

It might sound too simple to be true, but many users have tried this hack and achieved successful results. By bridging the connection between the two prongs, the home button works again like magic. It saves users time, money, and hassle of having to replace the entire iPad or paying for professional repairs.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, fixing a broken home button on the iPad 3 is easy when you know how to do it. The hack to fix it might seem crazy, but it works like magic. Determining the problem is vital before attempting the hack, and users should be careful not to damage any other components while fixing the button. By using this simple hack, users can continue to use their beloved iPad 3 without having to worry about a broken home button.

## Chosen Solution
 hi replace an digitizer of an ipad 3th and the home button is not working but if i jump the 2 gold prong where the home button make is contact the lcd open...
i tried an other home button and usb flex same problem

 Hello, most commonly, the home button module on the digitizer is not aligned properly. It is important to check the orientation of how the old home button was installed on the old or original digitizer that was removed.  If you have aligned it properly, I would highly recommend for you to order a new home button.

 Check the bracket placement and that there's no adhesive over the edge keeping the button from sitting too high causing no contact.
