If you're an iPhone 6 Plus owner, then you might have noticed an uneven lighting issue on your device's screen. Well, we did some research on this and uncovered a shocking truth about the design of the iPhone 6 Plus screen. 

It turns out that Apple secretly designed the iPhone 6 Plus with an unevenly lit display. According to experts, the display panel of the iPhone 6 Plus has an "edge-lit backlight system," which distributes light from the edge of the screen to the center. This design flaw causes the screen to appear brighter towards the edges and darker in the middle, resulting in an unevenly lit display. 

Many iPhone 6 Plus users have complained about this issue since the device's release in 2014. Some have even gone to the extent of exchanging their devices under warranty, only to receive another device with the same problem. 

So why did Apple design the iPhone 6 Plus with an edge-lit backlight system? Well, the answer lies in the device's slim profile. The iPhone 6 Plus was designed to be ultra-thin, and the edge-lit backlight system allowed Apple to achieve this. 

However, the downside to this design is an unevenly lit display, which can be frustrating for users, particularly while watching videos or reading text on the screen. 

Apple has never publicly acknowledged this design flaw in the iPhone 6 Plus, and it is unlikely that they will address it anytime soon. Nevertheless, some users have found a workaround to deal with the uneven lighting issue. By adjusting the brightness and contrast settings, users can somewhat improve the display output. 

In conclusion, the iPhone 6 Plus screen's uneven lighting issue is a result of a design flaw by Apple. While the edge-lit backlight system allowed Apple to create an ultra-thin device, it resulted in an unevenly lit display. As a solution, users can try adjusting their device's brightness and contrast settings to somewhat improve the display output.

## Chosen Solution
 What is a  Piece that must be changed

 If your lighting is weaker on one side then the other. It's your backlight that needs to be replaced, that is the only thing that lights up the screen. But I've never seen a backlight go bad.
