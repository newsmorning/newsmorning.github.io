Is Your Acer Laptop Hinge About to Snap? Discover the Shocking Truth About the Acer Aspire 515 51 86Aq!

If you own an Acer Aspire 515 51 86Aq, you may have noticed that the hinges on your laptop are starting to feel loose. You may have also noticed that your screen wobbles or even jiggles when you move your laptop around.

This is a common problem with Acer laptops, especially the Aspire series. Many owners have reported similar issues with their Acer laptops, where the hinges are prone to break over time.

So, why are Acer laptops so prone to hinge problems? And what can you do to prevent your Acer Aspire 515 51 86Aq hinge from breaking?

The problem with Acer laptop hinges

Acer laptops are known for their affordable prices and decent performance. However, one area where Acer laptops fall short is build quality.

Many Acer laptops, including the Aspire series, are made with plastic hinges. While plastic is cheaper and lighter than metal, it is not as strong or durable.

Over time, the constant opening and closing of the laptop can cause the hinges to wear out and become loose. This can lead to the screen becoming detached from the base of the laptop, or even breaking off completely.

In addition, the use of plastic hinges can cause a slight flex in the laptop screen. This can make the screen wobble or jiggle when the laptop is moved, making it difficult to use and read.

What can you do to prevent hinge problems?

If you own an Acer Aspire 515 51 86Aq or any other Acer laptop, there are a few things you can do to prevent hinge problems:

1. Be gentle when opening and closing your laptop. Use both hands to support the base and screen when opening and closing your laptop.

2. Avoid using your laptop on uneven surfaces. This can cause the screen to wobble and put unnecessary stress on the hinges.

3. Keep your laptop clean and dust-free. Dust, dirt, and debris can clog the hinges and cause them to wear out faster.

4. Invest in a laptop stand or cooling pad. These accessories can help to reduce heat and stress on your laptop, which can prolong the life of the hinges.

5. Consider upgrading to a laptop with metal hinges. While metal hinges may be more expensive, they are also more durable and less prone to breaking.

In conclusion

If you own an Acer Aspire 515 51 86Aq or any other Acer laptop, it is important to be aware of the common hinge problems that Acer laptops are prone to. By taking steps to prevent hinge problems and investing in a laptop stand or cooling pad, you can prolong the life of your laptop and avoid costly repairs.


## Chosen Solution
 After having my Acer Aspire 515-51-86Aq for about a year and a half (after the 1 year warranty expired), the left hinge started coming loose to the point where it is now stuck open and the attached screen holder is gradually becoming split open. Does anyone know of any easy fix for this or will I have to get the entire piece replaced?

 Is it affecting the back LCD assembly, or the palmrest? If it destroyed the palmrest, then you probably want to replace the part, rather then try and repair it due to it being a more “high stress” point in the chassis. These modern consumer laptops are bottom heavy, so repairing it down there is a horrible idea.
However, if it’s the LCD back (not the palmrest) and the damage may be repairable, what you can SOMETIMES do if the damage is permitting is use epoxy on the broken screw points, and potentially add some minor reinforcement with baking soda and super glue. It’s still “high stress”, but you can get away with a lot more back there.
Would I do this for a paying client? !&&* no; it’s a short term fix that may get you by until you can buy a new laptop, or do the “correct” fix, which is replacing the damaged parts. But what it may do is hold up long enough you can use it as a short term option, and then look into repair or replacement long term.
