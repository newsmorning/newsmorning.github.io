# Unlock the Secret to Financial Success: Learn How to Calculate Your Debt to Asset Ratio!

When it comes to managing personal finances, there are a few key ratios that you should be aware of. The debt to asset ratio is one of the most important, as it can help you determine your financial flexibility and overall financial health.

Calculating your debt to asset ratio is relatively simple. First, you need to determine your total debt. This includes any outstanding balances on credit cards, loans, and other forms of debt. Next, you need to determine your total assets. This includes everything from the value of your home and car to any investments or savings you may have.

Once you have these two figures, you can calculate your debt to asset ratio by dividing your total debt by your total assets. The resulting figure will be a percentage, which represents the portion of your assets that are being used to pay off your debts.

Ideally, you want this percentage to be as low as possible. A lower debt to asset ratio signifies that you have a greater amount of financial flexibility, as more of your assets are available to be used for other purposes.

So, why is this important? Well, having a high debt to asset ratio can indicate that you are carrying a significant amount of debt relative to your assets. This can be problematic because it means that you may have to rely heavily on your assets to pay off your debts, which can limit your ability to make other investments or financial moves.

On the other hand, having a low debt to asset ratio can indicate that you have more financial freedom and flexibility. It means that you have more assets at your disposal, which can be used for things like starting a new business, investing in stocks or bonds, or buying a new home.

Ultimately, calculating your debt to asset ratio is a powerful tool for assessing your financial health and making strategic financial decisions. Whether you are trying to pay off debt, save for retirement, or build your wealth, understanding this key ratio can help guide your decisions and pave the way to long-term financial success.

### Explanation
 
### Examples
 
Let’s see some simple to advanced examples to understand them better.

 
- Firstly, the company’s total debt is computed by adding all the short-term debts and long-term debts that can be gathered from the liability side of the balance sheet. Total debts = Total short term debts + Total long term debts Next, the company’s total assets can be computed by adding all the current and noncurrent assets that can gather from the asset side of the balance sheet. Total assets = Total current assets + Total non-current assets Finally, the debt to asset ratio formula can be derived by dividing the total debts (step 1) by the total assets (step 2).

 
Total debts = Total short term debts + Total long term debts
 
Total assets = Total current assets + Total non-current assets
 

 
#### Example #1
 
Let us take the example of a company called ABC Ltd, which is an automotive repair shop in Brazil. The company has been sanctioned a loan to build a new facility as part of its current expansion plan. Currently, ABC Ltd has $80 million in non-current assets, $40 million in current assets, $35 million in short-term debt, $15 million in long-term debt, and $70 million in stockholders’ equity. Calculate the debt to the asset for ABC Ltd.
 
As per the question,
 
Total debts
 
- Total debts = Short term debts + Long term debts= $35 million + $15 million= $50 million

 
Total Assets
 
- Total assets = Current assets + Non-current assets= $40 million + $80 million= $120 million

 
Therefore, the calculation of debt to total asset  ratio formula is as follows –
 
- Debt to Asset = $50 million / $120 million

 
Ratio will be –
 
- Debt to Asset = 0.4167

 
Therefore, we can say that 41.67% of the total assets of ABC Ltd are being funded by debt.
 
#### Example #2
 
Let us take the example of Apple Inc. and calculate the debt to asset ratio in 2017 and 2018 based on the following information.
 
Total Assets in 2017
 
- Total assets in 2017 = Total current assets + Total non-current assets= $128,645 Mn + $246,674 Mn= $375,319 Mn

 
Total Assets in 2018
 
- Total assets in 2018 = $131,339 Mn +$234,386 Mn= $365,725 Mn

 
Total Debts in 2017
 
- Total debts in 2017 = Commercial paperCommercial PaperCommercial Paper is a money market instrument that is used to obtain short-term funding and is often issued by investment-grade banks and corporations in the form of a promissory note.read more + Term debt (current portion) + Term debt (non-current portion)= $11,977Mn + $6,496 Mn + $97,207 Mn= $115,680 Mn

 
Total Debts in 2018 
 
- Total debts in 2018 = $11,964 Mn + $8,784 Mn + $93,735 Mn= $114,483 Mn

 
Using the above-calculated values, we will calculate Debt to assets for 2017 and 2018.
 
Calculation of Debt to Asset Ratio in 2017 
 
- Ratio in 2017 = Total debts in 2017 / Total assets in 2017= $115,680 Mn / $375,319 Mn

 
The ratio in 2017 will be –
 
- = 0.308

 
Ratio in 2018
 
- Ratio in 2018 = $114,483Mn / $365,725 Mn

 
The ratio in 2018 will be – 
 
- = 0.313

 
### Relevance and Uses
 
It is important to understand the debt to asset ratio because creditors commonly use it to measure debt quantity in a company. It can also be used to assess the debt repayment ability of a company to check if the company is eligible for any additional loans. On the other hand, the ratio is being used by the investors to ensure that the company is solvent, will be able to meet its current and future obligations, and has the potential to generate a healthy return on its investment.
 
This ratio is typically used by investors, analysts, and creditors to assess a company’s overall risk. A company with a higher ratio indicates that company is more leveraged. Hence, it is considered a risky investment, and the banker might reject the loan request of such an entity. Further, if the ratio of a company increases steadily, it could indicate that a default is imminent at some point in the future.
 
The following inferences can be used as a guide to assess the financial health of a company:
 
- If the ratio is equal to one, then it means that all the company assets are funded by debt, which indicates high leverage.If the ratio is greater than one, then it means that the company has more debt in its books than assets. It is indicative of extremely high leverage.If the ratio is less than one, then it means that the company has more assets than debts and, as such, has the potential to meet its obligations by liquidating its assets if required.
