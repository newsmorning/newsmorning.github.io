Are Lines RUINING Your Samsung 55" LED TV? Find Out How to FIX Them NOW!

If you're the proud owner of a Samsung 55" LED TV, you know just how breathtakingly beautiful the picture quality can be. Whether you're catching up on your favorite TV show, watching a movie or playing the latest video game, you want your TV to perform at its absolute best. Unfortunately, lines can often ruin the experience, and it's frustrating. In this article, we'll explain why those pesky lines appear and what you can do to fix them.

What Causes Lines on Your Samsung 55" LED TV?

Lines on your TV screen can be caused by several factors, but two main culprits stand out: a faulty T-con board or a broken display panel. The T-con board, also known as the timing control board, is responsible for processing the images sent from the input and generating the video signal. If this board is damaged, it can cause distortions or artifacts in the picture, leading to lines across the screen.

On the other hand, a broken display panel is a more severe problem that requires professional help. A screen crack or other physical damage to the panel will cause lines, distortions, and even dead pixels. If you can't recall any impacts or physical damage to the screen and the lines appeared on their own, there is still hope that the issue is with the T-con board.

How to Fix Lines on Your Samsung 55" LED TV

The good news is that repairing lines on a Samsung 55" LED TV is relatively easy and doesn't require any advanced technical skills. Here's what to do:

Step 1: Identify the Cause

Before you start any repairs, you need to identify whether the problem is with your TV's T-con board or the display panel. Here's how to do that:

- Turn on the TV and look for lines on the screen
- Check the TV's menu screens. If the lines appear even here, then the issue is with the display panel.
- If the lines don't show up on the menu screens but only in the picture, it's most likely a T-con board issue.

Step 2: Replace the T-con Board

If the lines are caused by a faulty T-con board, you can replace it easily. Here's how:

- Power off the TV and unplug it from the outlet.
- Locate the T-con board (usually found on the back of the TV).
- Disconnect the ribbon cables from the board.
- Unscrew or unclip the board from the TV, depending on the model.
- Replace the old T-con board with a new one.
- Reconnect the ribbon cables and attach the board back to the TV.

Step 3: Professional Help

If the problem is with the display panel, you will need to seek professional help. Contact Samsung customer support or an authorized TV repair shop for a quote and diagnosis.

Final Thoughts

Lines on a Samsung 55" LED TV are frustrating and can ruin the viewing experience. But fear not, because fixing them isn't complicated. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can identify the cause of the lines and fix them with relative ease. If in doubt or if you need any professional help, don't hesitate to contact Samsung customer support or an authorized TV repair shop.

## Chosen Solution
 Lines have appeared on my tv what’s wrong with it ? Because I have not got a clue  just turned the tv on and that’s what it’s like any help would be appreciated. Thanks

So with the extra pics is there anything else it could possibly be ? Thanks

 @lc9696 looks like vertical and horizontal lines as well as missing images on the top left corner. This most likely is a LCD driver board error. That board is considered part of the display and can not be replaced by the normal DIY’er. There is of course always a possibility that this is a main board (hope so) or bad cables. You want to disconnect everything from the back of your TV. Then unplug the TV and hold the power button down for about a minute or so. Then connect one device as input source. Preferably a local device like a DVD/BR play or even a game console. Then plug the TV back into power and start it up. Let us know if anything changed. Also, let us know what model your TV is.
