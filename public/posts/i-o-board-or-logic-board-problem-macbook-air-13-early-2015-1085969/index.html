You may not realize it, but this issue is more common than you think, and it’s important to take action quickly to avoid further damage to your precious MacBook.\nSo, what exactly is the issue?\nThe early 2015 MacBook Air 13 model comes with a flaw in its design that affects the I/O board and logic board. These two essential components are responsible for managing important functions like USB connections, audio, and power management. When they malfunction, it can cause a chain reaction of problems that can either render your MacBook useless or make it frustrating to use at best.\nThe symptoms of this problem can include:\nUSB ports malfunctioning or not working at all Power management issues, causing battery life problems Audio hardware problems or no sound output Display problems or flickering Issues with Wi-Fi connectivity or intermittent disconnections What can you do about it?\nThe first thing to do when you notice any of these issues is to take your MacBook to an authorized Apple service provider. Apple service providers have the experience and tools necessary to diagnose the problem and provide a solution.\nIn most cases, the I/O board and logic board will need to be replaced. This process can be costly and time-consuming, but it’s essential to protect your MacBook from further damage.

So, don’t wait – take action quickly to ensure the longevity and functionality of your MacBook.\nIn conclusion, if you’re experiencing any problems with your MacBook Air 13 early 2015 model, it’s likely due to the I/O board and logic board issue. Don’t let this problem go unaddressed – take your MacBook to an authorized Apple service provider as soon as possible, and protect your investment from further damage.\nChosen Solution Hello. I recently bought 13” MacBook Air early 2015 which was listed as non-working. I first plugged in the charger and it was sometimes charging and sometimes not. So I opened it and inspected the logic board, but everything seem just fine, no corrosion no burn marks nothing. After I inspected the I/O board I saw that it look a little bit odd. Some pins were purple and green instead of gold and some plastic parts did look burnt. But no corrosion again. After I plugged it back in again, with just the I/O board, logic board and fan this time, the light on the charger said it is charging (it wasn’t always working) and I checked the voltages on some parts on the board and there were none to very very little which was odd to me because in videos on youtube its always either working or on 0V. I then unplugged the I/O board and checked the voltages on ?? 6 pin ?? conector from I/O board to logic board. First two pins got 3.4V the third got 0.2V and the other three got 0V. I’m not sure if that is right or not but it seems odd to me and I don’t know if i need to replace only the I/O board and if the logic board is still OK? Can anyone please answer? Can I check the logic board other way without I/O board to determine if its still OK? Also sorry for my bad knowledge and language, I’m 17 years old and I don’t know a lot about these things but I’m looking forward to learn something :D Thank you very much\nArrow points on a thing that look a little bit odd to me. It look a little bit burned. At least the plastic on top of it looks like it was melted a little bit.\nVoltages on pins is from left to right 1 = 3.3V 2 = 3.3V 3 = 0.001V the rest are zero\ni dont know if the picture shows it but the little gold pins are not shiny gold. When i first opened it they were green and purple like burnt metal. I cleaned them but no difference\nGive this a try: Disconnect the mag-safe charger, unplug the battery from the logic board, press and hold the power button for ten seconds. Reconnect the battery, attach the mag-safe. It should spontaneously reboot at this point.\n","wordCount":"800","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Fred Tarr"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/i-o-board-or-logic-board-problem-macbook-air-13-early-2015-1085969/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your Macbook Air 13 Early 2015 Giving You a Headache?
