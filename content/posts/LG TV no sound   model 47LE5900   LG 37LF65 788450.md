Silence is NOT Gold: Shocking Reasons Why Your LG TVs Model 47Le5900 and LG 37Lf65 Have NO Sound!

Imagine sitting in front of your LG TV, eagerly waiting to watch your favorite movie or show, but alas, there's no sound. Frustrating, isn't it? If you're experiencing this with your LG TV models 47Le5900 or LG 37Lf65, then you're not alone. There are several reasons why your TV might not produce any sound, and it can be pretty shocking.

Firstly, one of the most common reasons why your TV might not be producing sound is if the mute button is accidentally pressed. This is a simple fix, as you can quickly check the remote control and see if the mute button is pressed. If so, all you have to do is press it again to deactivate the mute function.

If that doesn't work, the next thing to check is the sound settings. You may have accidentally adjusted the volume settings on your TV or even the sound source. Double-check the sound settings and ensure that everything is in the correct setting. This also includes checking if the sound source (like your cable box or streaming device) is powered on and correctly plugged into your TV.

If these simple fixes don't solve your sound problem, then it's time to look more thoroughly at the issue. At this point, it's best to seek professional help from a TV repair expert. The issue may be with the speakers, which may need replacement. In other cases, it may be a technical glitch that requires a more in-depth review to be resolved. It's essential to involve a trained professional for any complicated technical problems that you may be experiencing.

Moreover, some LG TVs models have software glitches that may cause your TV to lose sound. You may need to update your software to resolve this issue. Ensure that your TV is running on the latest firmware version. You can find this information on the LG website or contact their support team for help.

Another unexpected reason for no sound might be a blown-out capacitor or fuse. This reason tends to be more severe and will require expert assistance to replace the damaged capacitor or fuse. Other factors that may have caused the blown capacitor or fuse include voltage spikes, power surges, and fluctuations.

In conclusion, if your LG TV models 47Le5900 or LG 37Lf65 have no sound or low volume, then you need to take it seriously. Silence is NOT Gold when you're trying to watch your favorite shows or movies. The best thing you can do is troubleshoot for minor issues like checking the sound settings, source settings, panel, and remote control. If these minor adjustments fail to resolve your sound problem, ensure you contact a trained professional like TV repair experts, LG support team or dealer near you. Understanding the possible causes of no sound in your LG TV can make your life easier the next time you experience this issue.


## Chosen Solution
 Have no sound coming from my TV.
Have tried using headphones and get intermittent sound.

 Hi @mcstringer ,
It may be a that it is a faulty audio amp circuit in the TV  although this doesn’t really explain satisfactorily why there is intermittent audio only in the headphones and not the main speakers as well.
Here are some poor images (apologies) taken from the service manual that show that the audio is fed out of the TV’s CPU to the audio amp and then to the speakers and that the headphones have their own amp.

Sorry to be so vague but the TV will have to be opened and the problem further diagnosed as to the cause.
Note: The service manual can be used online. It is awkward however as you have to select the page number at the bottom below the document box every time that you wish to turn the page. To download it you need to register with the website.
