## Chosen Solution
 The screen on my 58in Vizio 4k tv is cracked and I am unable to find a replacement part. The model number is D58u-D3. Serial number LFTITSAR4809080. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

 I hate to be the one that brings the bad news, but if you are able to find a replacement screen for a tv, the cost would be more than what the tv is worth. The screens are the most expensive part of the tv. At this point what I do is take the boards out and try to sale them.
