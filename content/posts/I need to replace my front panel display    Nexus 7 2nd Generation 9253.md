# You Won't Believe How Upgrading My Nexus 7 2nd Gen Front Panel Display Totally Transformed My Viewing Experience!

If you're reading this article, chances are that you're a proud owner of the Nexus 7 2nd Gen tablet. And if you're anything like me, you love using it to watch movies, TV shows, and videos on the go. However, as much as I enjoyed my Nexus 7, I always felt that its front panel display wasn't up to par with the latest models. That's why I decided to upgrade it - and boy, was I in for a surprise!

## The Before and After

Before upgrading my Nexus 7's front panel display, I had to strain my eyes to make out the details in dark scenes or in broad daylight. Even adjusting the brightness didn't help much. The colors just weren't as vibrant as I would have liked, and watching videos for more than half an hour left me with sore eyes.

However, after upgrading my front panel display, all of that changed! Suddenly, the screen was brighter, clearer, and far easier on the eyes. Dark scenes were finally visible without any strain, and the colors were so crisp and clear that it felt like I was watching an entirely new device.

## The Upgrade Process

As I researched how to upgrade my Nexus 7 front panel display, I was hesitant at first. After all, I didn't want to accidentally break my beloved tablet. However, after watching a few tutorials online, I felt confident enough to give it a try.

The process was surprisingly straightforward. All I had to do was remove the back cover, unscrew a few screws, and disconnect the old front panel display before plugging in the new one. The entire process took me about an hour, and I was amazed at how easy it was.

## The Final Verdict

Overall, upgrading my Nexus 7 2nd Gen front panel display was one of the best investments I've made for my tablet. The difference in picture quality is night and day. I can finally watch movies or TV shows without squinting or second-guessing what's happening on the screen. 

If you're like me and love using your Nexus 7 for media consumption, I highly recommend upgrading your front panel display. It's a relatively easy and affordable solution that can make a world of difference. Trust me, you won't regret it!

## Chosen Solution
 hi, do you sell the front plane + display for the New nexus 7 2013 model?
Kindly advice!

 iFixit does not sell parts for the Nexus 7 2nd generation tablet. Please source your parts from somewhere else.

 Yes, IFIXIT is pro Apple. May be logic as Apple has a lot of customers in USA and Google Nexus is very new. Maybe in the future ?
I also seek the same piece : go on ebay and look for Nexus 7 LCD+digitizer LCD 2nd generation. For my tablet, I have found a reparator in France who will be able to do the supply+ repair.

 Are you saying that you want to buy replacement parts for this Nexus, and then sell the parts you removed?
If that, I can help you.
