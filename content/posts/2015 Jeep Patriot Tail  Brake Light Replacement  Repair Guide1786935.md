# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Fix Your 2015 Jeep Patriot's Tail and Brake Lights with This Simple Guide!

If your 2015 Jeep Patriot's tail and brake lights have gone out, you may be wondering how to fix them. It's not as difficult as you may think, and you can do it yourself with this simple guide.

Here's what you'll need:

- New tail and brake light bulbs (make sure they're the right ones for your Jeep Patriot's model year)
- A screwdriver
- A clean and dry cloth

Step 1: Open the Tailgate

Locate the tailgate of your Jeep Patriot and open it. Then, locate the screws or clips that hold the tail light cover in place. Depending on the model of your vehicle, these may be located either on the inside or outside of the tail light assembly.

Step 2: Remove the Tail Light Cover

Using a screwdriver or your hands, remove the screws or clips that hold the tail light cover in place. Once the cover is loose, carefully pull it away from the vehicle.

Step 3: Remove the Old Bulbs

Once you have access to the tail light bulbs, turn the bulb socket counterclockwise to remove it from its housing. You'll then be able to pull the old bulb out of the socket.

Step 4: Install the New Bulbs

Insert the new tail light bulbs into the socket, being careful not to touch the glass part of the bulb with your fingers. Once the bulb is in place, turn the socket clockwise to secure it in the housing.

Step 5: Replace the Tail Light Cover

Carefully position the tail light cover back onto the vehicle and reattach any clips or screws that secure it in place.

Step 6: Test the Lights

Close the tailgate and turn on your Jeep Patriot's headlights. Check to see if the tail lights and brake lights are working properly. If they are, then congratulations! You have successfully fixed your 2015 Jeep Patriot's tail and brake lights.

In Conclusion

Fixing your 2015 Jeep Patriot's tail and brake lights doesn't have to be a difficult or expensive task. With just a few simple tools and a little bit of know-how, you can easily replace the bulbs and get back on the road safely. So, next time your lights go out, don't be afraid to tackle this simple repair on your own!

## Introduction
 
The purpose of a tail/ brake light is to make your car visible during nighttime and heavy weather conditions and to communicate to the driver behind you that you are slowing down or stopping.  A broken tail/ brake light is dangerous to yourself and the drivers around you. You could also get pulled over and receive a citation if your tail light is out.
 
Before beginning the repair, park in a safe location, turn the car off and put the emergency brake on.
