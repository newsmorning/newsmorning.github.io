Title: Shocking Revelation: I Replaced My iPhone SE Home Button and It's Still Broken - Find Out Why!

Introduction
As an iPhone user, you must be familiar with the home button. This button has been an essential part of the iPhone's physical design, and it serves several purposes, such as unlocking the iPhone and returning to the home screen. However, what happens when the home button stops working? The quick solution is to replace it, but what if the replacement doesn't work too? Well, that was the case with me, and I decided to share my experience. 

Background
I had an iPhone SE that I had been using for almost two years, and it was working perfectly fine until one day the home button stopped responding. I tried all the solutions recommended online, but none of them worked. So, I concluded that I would have to replace the home button. After purchasing the necessary tools and following the step-by-step tutorial videos, I was able to replace my home button. But to my surprise, the home button was still unresponsive even after replacement. 

Root Cause
So, I decided to dig deeper and see what the root cause of the problem was. After hours of research and trying different solutions, I discovered that the problem was not with the home button, but it was with the iPhone SE's motherboard. The home button has a physical connection to the motherboard, and when the connection is interrupted, the home button will not work. This connection can be affected by external factors such as water damage, dust accumulation, or drops, and it may not be visibly damaged. 

Conclusion
Replacing an iPhone home button is a quick solution that has worked for many iPhone users with unresponsive home buttons. However, it may not always work. In my case, the root cause of the problem was a damaged connection to the motherboard, and replacing the home button did not fix the problem. If you find yourself in a similar situation, I would recommend seeking the advice of a professional technician or taking your iPhone to an authorized service center. Trying to fix it yourself may worsen the situation. 

In summary, having an unresponsive iPhone home button can be frustrating, but it's essential to understand its root cause before attempting to fix it. Don't be afraid to seek help from a professional technician, and be cautious when following tutorial videos online. Finally, always remember that prevention is better than cure. You can prevent damage to your iPhone by handling it with care, avoiding exposure to water or dust, and using protective cases.

## Chosen Solution
 Home button was replaced professionally last summer due to liquid damage. The replacement button only worked for about 3 months. Thought I would try my hand at fixing it - after they diagnosed it a second time, saying they would replace the home button again for another $70. Spent this morning replacing the home button … still does not work. So perhaps the old button (hardware) was not the problem? What else could be wrong? It charges fine. And can be plugged into the computer with no issue.

 Liquid damage can be very difficult to repair and can leave tons of rabbit holes. I would try a new charge port assembly next. If that doesn’t fix it, seek out a replacement.
Although repair is practical in a lot of cases, liquid damage isn’t really one of them unfortunately.
