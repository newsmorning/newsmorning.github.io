Is Your MacBook Pro Unable to Recognize HGST 7K1000? Discover the Surprising Solution Now!

If you are a MacBook Pro user and have recently upgraded to a HGST 7K1000 hard drive, you may be facing an issue where your computer is not recognizing the drive. This can be a frustrating and baffling problem, especially since you've invested time, money, and effort to upgrade your machine.

Fortunately, there is a surprisingly simple solution that can fix the problem and get your MacBook Pro up and running in no time. Read on to discover the steps you need to take to overcome this issue.

Possible Causes of the Problem:

Before we proceed to the solution, it's necessary to identify the possible causes of the problem. Here are three reasons why your MacBook Pro might not be recognizing HGST 7K1000:

- Incorrect formatting: If the hard drive has not been formatted correctly, the MacBook Pro may not recognize it. In some cases, if the drive has been formatted for Windows, it may not be compatible with MacOS.
- Cable issue: Sometimes, the data cable connecting the hard drive and the motherboard can be loose, which can result in the MacBook Pro failing to recognize the hard drive. 
- Faulty hard drive: There's always the possibility that the hard drive is simply not functioning properly.

Solution:

To solve the problem, you will need to follow the steps below:

Step 1: Check the Hard Drive Formatting

Connect the HGST 7K1000 hard drive to your MacBook Pro and launch the 'Disk Utility' app. If the drive appears in the left-hand column of the app, select it and click on the 'Erase' button. From here, choose the appropriate file system (typically MacOS Extended Journaled) and hit the 'Erase' button. This should format the hard drive and make it recognizable with your MacBook Pro.

Step 2: Check the Data Cable

If the hard drive is still not recognized after formatting, it's time to check the data cable. MacBook Pros typically have two data cables: one for the hard drive and one for the optical drive. Ensure that the hard drive cable is properly seated and not loose. If the cable appears to be loose, disconnect it and reconnect it before testing the system again.

Step 3: Test the Hard Drive

If the cable is secure, but the problem persists, you should test the hard drive itself. The easiest way to do this is to remove the hard drive from your MacBook Pro and connect it to a different computer. If the drive is recognized by another computer, then the issue is with your MacBook Pro. However, if it's still not recognized, then the hard drive itself is the problem and should be replaced.

Conclusion:

Upgrading your MacBook Pro to an HGST 7K1000 hard drive can significantly improve your computer's performance. However, if the machine is not recognizing the drive, it can be frustrating. The good news is that the solution is surprisingly simple, and you can use the tips above to diagnose and solve the issue. If you're still having trouble, don't hesitate to reach out to a professional for more help.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
My problem looks like this.
I received the old MB from my brother because it was very slow.
Therefore, I have the HDD replaced an old and OSX installed and everything worked well. Only the installation of windows did not go.
That's why I tested the HDD with PartedMagic and it was identified as broken.
Now I have bought the HGST 7K1000 and it is neither displayed in Diskutitlity nor in Parted Magic, who has ne idea how I can fix?
Thank you!

 OK, lets start off here on the Windows utility you are trying to use here Parted Magic it does not support the Mac's disk structure and file system your system has here: GUID & Mac OS Extended (Journaled). You would need either to use Apples Disk Utility or something like this: Drive Genius
But lets see if we can work with what you have now.
You state you took out the old drive as it failed with Parted Magic. If the drive is still able to boot up under Mac OS-X lets see if we can get that far as we need it to gain access to the utility it has on it in the Application/Utility folder Disk Utility but the system needs to be running Mac OS-X first to use it.
You'll need something like this: Startech 2.5" SATA to USB adapter so we can connect your new drive to your system. Now we can use Disk Utility to setup your new drive. Here's a small write up that gets into it: How to Manage Disks and Volumes with OS Xâ€™s Disk Utility
The other option here (if the drive is not recoverable) is if your system has the updated firmware is to connect your system to the internet (as fast a connection possible) then let the Internet recovery service download from Apples site the installer. To get the system in to this mode restart it and hold the following keys: Command-Option-R for reference: Startup key combinations for Mac
Once the installer firsts loads up you can access the Disk Utility services from within it. It can take sometime depending on your network & internet speed.
Once the Mac OS is installed, you should make a bootable backup drive so you have a means to do drive repairs more quickly. I would prep up a 16 GB thumb drive using Disk Utility to first wipe the FAT32 partition the USB drives tend to have on them and then setup the needed GUID & Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition.
Now go to the Apple store and download the OS installer (only the newest version will be available - MacOS Sierra) download it, exit the installer which will autolaunch, make a copy of it as afterwards it will be deleted (its in your Apps folder) then relaunch it. You'll want to run it twice here first updating your system with it and then again to install the OS onto the thumb drive. Once done copy the OS installer to the dumb drive just in case for the next time.
The last piece here is if you want to run Windows you'll want to setup BootCamp with your Windows OS image file or DVD. Follow this on how to do it: How to install Windows using Boot Camp.
Don't forget to add more memory if you only have 4 GB, I would go with 12 or 16 GB if you are running both OS's (macOS & Windows). If you aren't then 8 GB will be just fine for most things.
Let us know how it goes. Good Luck!
