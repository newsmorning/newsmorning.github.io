Needless to say, if Windows volume is too low despite your volume slider reaching 100, you know there is something wrong. That being said, a low PC volume isn’t something that can’t be fixed. Here are some of the best ways to fix low volume on a Windows PC.\nHow To Fix Low Audio Issues in Windows 11/ 10- Best Methods 1. Use Audio Troubleshooter Windows offers an inbuilt troubleshooter that may help you fix the issue without much effort. The Audio Troubleshooter can help detect the issue automatically and suggest a fix accordingly. Here are the steps to use the Audio Troubleshooter –\nOpen Settings by pressing Windows + I.\nFrom the left-hand side select System(if not already selected).\nFrom the right-hand side, click on Troubleshoot.\nClick on Other troubleshooters.\nUnder Most frequentclick on the Run button next to Playing Audio as shown in the screenshot below.\n2. Increase Media Player Sound And Sound of Apps In many cases when you play an audio track especially if you are using a third-party media player, you are effectively dealing with two audio levels. The first is the volume of your PC’s speakers and the second, is your Media Player’s volume. Here, you can check the volume levels of your Media Player and increase them, if they are low.\nMy Windows audio was working just fine, but as soon as I connected to a Skype meeting, the volume was very low. I could hardly listen to others. Despite increasing the system volume by pushing the volume slider to the right, the volume still remained muffled.\nIn the above-mentioned case, it could be that your Windows volume is not low per se, but the specific app has a low volume. For this, you can even refer to Windows’ Volume Mixer and check the audio levels as shown in the screenshot below. For this –\nOpen Settings by pressing Windows + I.\nFrom the right, click on Sound.\nScroll down until you reach Advanced, and click on Volume Mixer.\nUnder Apps increase the volume levels of the app where you are facing low volume issues.\n3.

Maybe the overall volume is quite audible, but as soon as you plug in the microphone, the audio becomes very low. Or, it could be that as soon as you plug in external speakers via jack or Bluetooth, the audio is very low. Whatever might be the case –\nOpen Settingsby pressing Windows + I key combination.\nClick on System from the left-hand side (if not already selected).\nFrom the right-hand side, click on Sound,which should be the second option.\nThe Soundsection can be divided into three parts – Output, Input, and Advanced.\nClick on each option and tweak the volume slider (if needed).\nAfter you have tweaked each of the volume sliders under each of the options, now check if the volume is as per your liking or not.\n4. Use A Third-Party Equilizer While you resolve the issue at hand, in the meantime, you can use a third-party equalizer like Boom 3D. It is one of the best apps that can help improve sound playback, thanks to the wide variety of customizable settings that it comes with.
