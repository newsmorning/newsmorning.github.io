Infinix’s HOT line of smartphone has been pretty popular with users, for a simple reason. The devices pack the absolute necessary specs, all in a bid to hit a specific price-point.
 
Take the Infinix Hot 8 for instance. The device is powered by the  MediaTek’s Octa-core Helio P22 processor and supported by 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal memory. You can read more about that here.
 
Infinix has just revealed the successor to the Hot 8, uninterestingly dubbed the Infinix Hot 9. So what is with this new device? What does it bring to the table?
 
## Infinix Hot 9 Specifications
 
First off, the specifications;
 
- Display: 6.6-inch 720 x 1600 pixels HD+ display.Camera: 16 MP + 2 MP + 2 MP + 0.3 MP Main/ 8 MP front.Storage: 64/128 GB.RAM: 3/4 GB.CPU: Octa-core 1.8 GHz, Mediatek Helio A25.OS: Android 10, XOS 6.

 
Most notable is the fact that Infinix has scrapped off the 16 GB models options, this time starting with 32 GB for the base model. In 2020, this is honestly long overdue. No phone should come with 16 GB storage.
 
Also notable is that the device packs a Quad camera array. This comprises of a 13 MP (main), 2 MP (macro), 2 MP (depth) and a low light sensor. How well this setup works, well, we have to wait to have the device in hand.
 
On the flip-side, selfie lovers are catered for, thanks to an 8 MP selfie shooter that comes on all storage options.
 
The device comes in four different color variants: Matte Black, Cyan, Violet, and Light Blue.
 
The device has just been made official in Indonesia and is likely to hit stores in India in April. We should expect the device to make its way to local shores sometime in April as well.
 
That said, with the ongoing global crisis that is the Corona Virus (COVID-19), these timelines are written in sand and it might be long before we see any of these devices shipping out.
 
## Pricing & Availability
 
Pricing details are still a little scanty and we have to wait for local launches before we can definitively say. However, from previous iterations of the HOT line, we can deduce that the Infinix Hot 9 should start at around Ksh 10,000 ($100) with the maxed out option going for around Ksh 14,000 ($140).
 
We’ll keep you posted and most definitely review the device once it is officially launched in Africa. Stay tuned.
