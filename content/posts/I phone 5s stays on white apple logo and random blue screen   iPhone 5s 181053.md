Have you ever experienced the dreaded never-ending white Apple logo and mysterious blue screen glitch on your iPhone, iPad or iPod? This glitch is not only frustrating, but it can also cause you to lose data and completely disrupt your daily routine. However, there are a few things you can do to fix this issue and get your device up and running again. 

## Understanding the Never-ending White Apple Logo and Mysterious Blue Screen Glitch

When you turn on your device, the white Apple logo should appear briefly before your device boots up. However, sometimes the logo appears and never disappears. This means your device is stuck in a boot loop. Sometimes, after the never-ending white Apple logo, a mysterious blue screen appears, and your device shuts down automatically. This could be due to a software or hardware issue.

## How to Fix the Never-ending White Apple Logo and Mysterious Blue Screen Glitch

Here are some ways to fix the never-ending white Apple logo and mysterious blue screen glitch:

### 1. Force Restart Your Device 

The first thing you should try is a force restart. This will not erase any data on your device. Here's how to do it:

- On iPhone 8 or later: Press and quickly release the Volume Up button. Press and quickly release the Volume Down button. Then, press and hold the Side button until you see the Apple logo.
- On iPhone 7: Press and hold the Side button and Volume Down button at the same time until you see the Apple logo.
- On iPhone 6s or earlier: Press and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button at the same time until you see the Apple logo.

### 2. Restore Your Device 

If a force restart doesn't work, you can try restoring your device to its factory settings. This will erase all your data, so make sure you have a backup. Here's how to do it:

- Connect your device to your computer and open iTunes.
- Select your device in iTunes and click on the "Restore iPhone/iPad/iPod" button.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to restore your device to its factory settings.

### 3. Update Your Device 

Updating your device to the latest version of iOS can sometimes fix the never-ending white Apple logo and mysterious blue screen glitch. Here's how to do it:

- Go to Settings > General > Software Update.
- If an update is available, tap "Download and Install."
- Follow the on-screen instructions to update your device.

### 4. Contact Apple Support 

If none of the above solutions work, you can contact Apple Support for further help. They will be able to assist you in resolving the issue.

## Final Thoughts

The never-ending white Apple logo and mysterious blue screen glitch can be frustrating, but don't panic. There are ways to fix it. Try force restarting your device, restoring your device, updating your device, or contacting Apple Support.

## Chosen Solution
 i did a screen replacement on an iphone 5s that has a broken lcd. i changed it and now i phone 5s stays on white apple logo and random blue screen pops up.
It is not the proximity flex as i have already changed that. i also changed the battery but still nothing. I also tried a different lcd but still nothing different.

 Hello I'm afraid the motherboard is damaged there are four screws on the emi shield that cover the lcd connectors the top left and top right screws will be long screws the bottom left and right should be small screws.
Go and check I bet you have a long screw in one one the bottom screw holes..
A long screw in the bottom screw holes will accually screw through traces on the motherboard

 Have you actually checked for markings where con has suggested the damage might be?
I always use a magnetic mat and put the screws in the exact same patteren as they come off, even on the 4/4s which I've done many and can tell which screws go where now, very easy to become complacent. Again,  just check the board where the screws would have gone.

 Well that's the reason for a blue screen when screws arnt put in proper place
