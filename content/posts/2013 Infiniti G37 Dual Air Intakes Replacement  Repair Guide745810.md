STOP! Is Your 2013 Infiniti G37 Suffering from Poor Performance? Discover the Ultimate Dual Air Intake Replacement Repair Guide Now!

If you own a 2013 Infiniti G37, you know just how much power and performance your car can deliver. However, there comes a time when even the most powerful cars start to show signs of wear and tear. Poor performance can be a frustrating issue that can make your car feel sluggish and unresponsive.

One of the most common causes of poor performance in an Infiniti G37 is a clogged air intake. Your car's engine requires a steady flow of fresh air to breathe, and if there is an obstruction in the air intake system, your engine will not be able to perform at its full potential.

Luckily, there's a solution to this problem that doesn't require a trip to the dealership or a mechanic. By replacing your car's dual air intake with a high-performance replacement, you can restore your engine's power and improve your car's overall performance.

In this article, we'll explore the benefits of upgrading your Infiniti G37's air intake system and provide you with a step-by-step guide to help you install your new air intake like a professional.

Why Upgrade Your Air Intake System?

Upgrading your Infiniti G37's air intake system can be one of the most cost-effective ways to improve your car's overall performance. Here are some of the benefits of replacing your stock air intake with a high-performance dual air intake:

Increased Horsepower: By increasing the amount of air that your engine can breathe in, you can boost your car's horsepower and performance.

Improved Throttle Response: A high-performance air intake will help your engine respond more quickly to your throttle commands, making your car feel more responsive and agile.

Better Fuel Economy: By improving your engine's efficiency, a new air intake system can help you save on gas.

Enhanced Sound: A high-performance air intake system can also improve the sound of your engine, giving your car a more aggressive and sporty tone.

Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Your New Air Intake System

Now that you know the benefits of replacing your Infiniti G37's air intake system let's take a look at how you can install your new air intake yourself.

Step 1: Remove the Old Air Intake

The first step to installing your new air intake is to remove the old air intake system. Begin by locating the air intake box and removing it from the engine bay. You may need to remove some additional components, such as the air filter, to access the intake box. Be sure to label and set aside any parts you remove so that you can reinstall them later.

Step 2: Install the New Air Intake

Once you've removed the old air intake, it's time to install the new air intake system. Begin by installing the air filter onto the intake tubing, and then connect the tubing to the engine's throttle body. Be sure to tighten all clamps and connections securely.

Step 3: Connect the Air Intake to the Breather Hose

Next, connect the air intake system to the breather hose, which is located on the valve cover. Again, be sure to tighten all connections securely.

Step 4: Reinstall Any Removed Components

Finally, reinstall any components that you removed to access the air intake system, such as the air filter. Be sure to double-check that everything is connected securely and properly installed.

Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to test out your new high-performance air intake system. You should notice an immediate improvement in your car's performance, with better throttle response and increased power.

Conclusion

If you're tired of dealing with a sluggish and unresponsive Infiniti G37, upgrading your car's air intake system is a great way to boost your engine's performance. By following this simple guide, you can replace your car's old air intake system with a new high-performance dual air intake, and experience the benefits of improved horsepower, throttle response, fuel economy, and sound.

## Introduction
 
-10 mm ratchet with a short extension
 
-7 mm ratchet
 
-5 mm ratchet
 
-vice-grips (pliers are also okay)
 
Finally, what makes this task moderate, in my opinion, is that the air intakes can range in many different combinations which cause the assembly of the new air intakes to be slightly different. For example, my air intakes did not come with a firewall, but some will as you get better quality set-ups.
