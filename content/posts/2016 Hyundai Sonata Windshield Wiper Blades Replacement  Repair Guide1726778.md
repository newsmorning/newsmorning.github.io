# Is Your 2016 Hyundai Sonata Putting You at Risk? Learn How to Replace Your Windshield Wiper Blades with Our Step-by-Step Guide!

Driving a 2016 Hyundai Sonata is an experience that many owners enjoy. It offers a smooth ride, efficient gas mileage, and a slew of cutting-edge technology features. However, one aspect of car maintenance that often goes overlooked is changing out the windshield wiper blades. At first glance, it seems like a minor task, but replacing your wiper blades is a critical step in making sure that you stay safe on the road. In this article, we will show you how to change the wiper blades on a 2016 Hyundai Sonata step-by-step.

## Materials Needed

Before you start, you will need to gather some essential materials. Here's what you will need:

- New windshield wiper blades (compatible with 2016 Hyundai Sonata)
- Soft cloth or paper towels
- A pair of pliers
- A flathead screwdriver

## Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you have all your materials gathered let’s dive into the step-by-step process of replacing your wiper blades.

Step 1: Locate the Wiper Blades

The first step is to locate the wiper blades on your 2016 Hyundai Sonata. They are located on the base of your windshield and can be easily identified by their black rubber blades. Make sure that the wipers are in the "off" position before proceeding.

Step 2: Remove the Old Wiper Blades

Using a flathead screwdriver, gently lift the tab on the wiper blade's connector. This will release the old wiper blade from the arm. Once the tab is lifted, use your hands to gently slide the old wiper blade down towards the base of the arm. Lift the wiper blade up and away from the arm.

Step 3: Prepare the New Wiper Blades

Unpack your new wiper blades and familiarize yourself with the connector mechanism. Most wiper blades come with a variety of connector options, so be sure to select the one that fits your 2016 Hyundai Sonata. Once you have selected the correct connector, slide it through the opening on the wiper blade so that it clicks into place.

Step 4: Attach the New Wiper Blades

Align the new wiper blade with the arm, making sure that the connector is firmly in place. Once you have aligned the blade, use your pliers to snap the tab back into place. Gently tug on the wiper blade to ensure that it is securely connected to the arm.

Step 5: Test the Wiper Blades

Turn on your windshield wiper system to test your new wiper blades. Make sure that they are sweeping evenly across the windshield with no skipping or streaking. If you notice any issues, double-check that the wiper blades are correctly installed and retest.

Conclusion

Replacing the windshield wiper blades on your 2016 Hyundai Sonata is a quick and easy task, but it's one that could potentially save your life. Faulty wiper blades can obstruct your view and impair your ability to drive safely during inclement weather conditions. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can replace your wiper blades and drive with confidence, knowing that your windshield wiper system is in excellent working condition.
