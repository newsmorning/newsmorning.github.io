Battlefield 1 is undoubtedly one of the best FPS games out there, attracting millions of players from around the globe. But just like any other game, it comes with its set of issues. One of the most annoying issues for gamers is the FPS drop and lag, which can ultimately ruin the gameplay experience. But worry not, here are 5 insane hacks to stop your FPS drops and lag in Battlefield 1:

One of the easiest and most effective ways of stopping FPS drops and lag in Battlefield 1 is by optimizing the game settings. Tweaking the graphics settings can help reduce the workload on your system, lowering the risk of lag and FPS drops.

Background software, such as anti-virus programs, can significantly impact your game's performance. It's essential to identify these applications and disable them to free up system resources, potentially increasing FPS and reducing lag.

4. Overclock Your GPU

Overclocking your GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, can improve your gameplay experience, as it increases your computer's graphics processing power. However, it's essential to keep in mind the technical limitations of your system's hardware and take precautions to avoid overheating or other risks.

5. Upgrade Your System Components

If all else fails, upgrading your system components is the ultimate solution to stopping FPS drops and lag. Upgrading the CPU, RAM, or graphics card can significantly improve gameplay performance, allowing you to experience the game as it was intended.

In conclusion, FPS drops and lag can be frustrating, ruining your gameplay experience. However, by utilizing the hacks mentioned above, you can significantly reduce the risk of these issues and enjoy Battlefield 1 to the fullest. Happy gaming!
