# Discover the Only 5 VPNs That Can Help You Bypass the Great Firewall of China!

China's Great Firewall is one of the world's most notorious online censorship and surveillance systems. It's a collection of technologies and legal regulations that the Chinese government uses to control the internet within the country's borders. Many popular websites and services are blocked in China, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

However, with the right virtual private network (VPN) service, you can bypass the Great Firewall and access the open internet from within China. In this article, we'll introduce you to the only 5 VPNs that can help you bypass the Great Firewall of China.

## 1. ExpressVPN

ExpressVPN is one of the most popular VPN services in the world, and for good reason. It has a reputation for being fast, secure, and reliable. ExpressVPN is also one of the few VPNs that consistently works in China, thanks to its proprietary obfuscation technology that can evade the Great Firewall's sophisticated detection methods.

## 2. NordVPN

NordVPN is another top-rated VPN service that can bypass the Great Firewall of China. Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN uses obfuscation technology to disguise its VPN traffic as regular internet traffic. NordVPN also has a large server network, which can help you find a server location that works with your internet connection in China.

## 3. Surfshark

Surfshark is a relatively new VPN service, but it's already gained a reputation as an effective tool for bypassing the Great Firewall of China. Surfshark uses a feature called "Camouflage Mode" that makes its VPN traffic look like regular HTTPS traffic, which can help it evade detection by the Great Firewall.

## 4. VyprVPN

VyprVPN is a VPN service that's specifically designed for getting around government censorship and online surveillance. It uses its proprietary Chameleon protocol to scramble VPN traffic and make it undetectable by the Great Firewall. VyprVPN also has a large server network with multiple server locations in Asia, which can improve your connection speeds in China.

## 5. PrivateVPN

PrivateVPN is a lesser-known VPN service, but it's still a powerful tool for bypassing the Great Firewall of China. PrivateVPN uses its own stealth VPN technology to disguise VPN traffic as regular internet traffic. PrivateVPN has fewer server locations than some of the other VPNs on this list, but it still has multiple server locations in Asia that can work well in China.

## Conclusion

If you're planning on traveling to China and want access to the open internet, a VPN is an essential tool. However, not all VPN services can bypass the Great Firewall of China. The five VPN services we've introduced in this article are the only ones we can recommend with confidence for use in China. Whether you choose ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, VyprVPN, or PrivateVPN, make sure you choose a VPN service that can keep you connected and protected while you're in China.

Internet censorship is one feature that makes China one of the most secured nations internet-wise. This is all thanks to the Great Firewall of China, which restricts access to numerous websites such as Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook in the country. As secure as this sounds, you can circumvent this security with the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) provided by a VPN service provider.
 
A VPN allows you to hide your IP address in an encrypted manner and gives you access to restricted websites as you can appear to be from any other region of your choice.
 
Getting a reliable one might be a tad difficult, so, we’ll walk you through the 5 VPNs that work in China with ease. So, if you’re on a visit to the mighty Asian country, you can leave out the worries of the Great Firewall of China. Take a look at what the Great Firewall is in this article.
 
Mind you, the Government of the Republic of China is aware that people living in China bypass the internet censorship, therefore, a rule was made that the major telecom giants in the nation should obstruct VPN services. However, VPN service providers developed extra measures to face this uphill task.
 
The 5 VPNs which we will be sharing with you are the most reputable amidst them. Let’s take a look.
 
## 1. ExpressVPN
 

 
On top of the list, we have the ExpressVPN. There’s really not much of a point to emphasize that this service is well designed to sidetrack the censorship.
 
In the security chamber, the service uses a 256-bit AES encryption, VPN protocols supports, DNS/IPv6 leak protection and TOR compatibility.
 
With servers in as many as 100 countries, the VPN’s reliability & smooth connection is unrivaled. As security is precisely detailed on the VPN, so is the fast speed it presents. Even more, the company’s customer service is what most VPN users in China complement.
 
To use this service, $12.95 has to be shelled out on a monthly basis although if it’s to be paid annually, the service will be made available at the rate of $8.32 per month. Although it’s a bit on the high side, it’s a value-for-money service.
 
## 2. NordVPN
 
NordVPN, here’s another impressive VPN that has excellence written all over it. The VPN has a feisty technology that helps to beat off the prying eyes of the Great Firewall in order to access the websites you so much love.
 
For the Mac Client, NordVPN employs two security technologies – Next Generation Encryption (NGE) IKEv2/IPsec and 256bit-GCM for encryption. Added to this, users can opt to use a feature called the Double VPN servers wherein data is processed over two different servers in separate regions. This adds more security to the VPN although it might affect the speed a little.
 
NordVPN also doesn’t cheap as it costs $11.95 per month. Well, that’s how premium it can get. The good side is, the service provider offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Other features include the round the clock customer service and super speed unlimited bandwidth for torrenting to mention a few.
 
## 3. VyprVPN
 
Chameleon technology, the stealth packaged technology with which VyprVPN uses to circumvent the Firewall has been the highlight of this service provider.
 
This service also employs the 256-bit encryption tech and free smart DNS service. Interestingly, it functions across iOS and Android devices. Sadly, it lacks support for torrenting. Its basic plan costs $5 on a monthly basis while its premium package will require $6.67 per month on an annual billing.
 
## 4. PureVPN
 
PureVPN has been in the game for a considerable amount of time, so reliability is one of its selling points. Additionally, the VPN service provider has some of its servers based in China and supports five simultaneous connections.
 
The service has app supports for Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS devices. Features such as the DNS and IPv6 leak protection, 256-bit encryption, NAT firewall add-on as well as a kill switch entail some of the vibrant security on the device.
 
PureVPN comes with a very cheap subscription of $2.88 per month. Users can even share data via the service as the creation of Wi-Fi VPN hotspot is enabled on the service.
 
## 5. TunnelBear
 
A couple of free VPNs are out there but the idea that it’s free scares people away. TunnelBear is one of the most daunting free VPN services out there.
 
The company makes use of the standard 256-bit AES encryption that’s utilized by most of the premium VPN providers like ExpressVPN and Nord VPN. There are two fascinating features of the service that contribute to its security: “VigilantBear” and “GhostBear”.
 
While the former tracks & shut off unsecured traffic when a wireless connection is lost, the latter ensures that the Chinese Government finds it difficult to trace the user’s encrypted data.
