Title: You'll Be SHOCKED to Learn the 5 Simple Steps to Check if Your PC has TPM 2.0 - Don't Miss Out!

Subtitle: Why TPM 2.0 is Crucial for Your Computer and How to Determine if Your PC has it.

Are you curious if your computer has Trust Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 installed? You should be! It's an essential security feature that protects your computer's data from being accessed by unauthorized users. Not only does it offer security benefits but it also ensures that your computer is running the latest and most up-to-date software versions.

In this article, we'll discuss the importance of TPM 2.0 for your computer and take you through five easy steps to check if your device has it. Keep reading to find out more about this critical component and why it matters for your machine's overall security.

What is TPM 2.0?

TPM 2.0 is a secure cryptographic module that is integrated into the hardware of a computer or device. It provides hardware-based security functions that help to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data, the integrity of the system, and the protection against unauthorized access. TPM 2.0 is also used to store cryptographic keys and certificates that are associated with the device's security functions.

Why is TPM 2.0 important for your computer?

TPM 2.0 is essential for your computer to provide an additional layer of security for your sensitive data. It makes it possible to limit access to sensitive files and folders by authorized users only. Furthermore, because TPM 2.0 is integrated into the hardware of the computer, it cannot be disabled, deleted or attacked even by malware.

TPM 2.0 also keeps your computer up-to-date. TPM 2.0 provides trusted boot functionality for the operating system, which ensures that the boot process is secure and ensures that your computer is running the latest software versions.

How can you tell if your computer has TPM 2.0?

Fortunately, determining whether your computer has a TPM 2.0 is easy. Follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Search "Device Manager" in your computer's search bar.

Step 2: Once you find the Device Manager, click on the drop-down arrow next to "Security Devices".

Step 3: Look for "Trusted Platform Module" on the list of devices. If it's there, your computer is equipped with a TPM module.

Step 4: If you see TPM but not TPM 2.0, click on the device and go to its properties. Under the Details tab, select "Compatible Id". If you see the value of "TPM2", then you have TPM 2.0.

Step 5: If you're using a PC with Windows 7 OS, you'll need to enable TPM 2.0 in the BIOS.

Conclusion

In conclusion, TPM 2.0 is a vital component to your computer's security and functionality. By following the five steps above, you can determine whether your PC has the module. If not, it's time to consider upgrading. Don't overlook this fundamental security feature- add TPM 2.0 to your computer's yearly security plan.

PC manufacturers have been offering TPM (Trusted Platform Module) in business-class computers since 2011. If you bought your PC after 2016, there is a good chance that your PC has TPM 2.0. Older PCs might have TPM version 1.2 or might not have one at all.
 









 
Since TPM was not required to install and run Windows 10, most users have not heard about it. If you plan to upgrade your Windows 10 installation to Windows 11 when it becomes available, you better make sure that your PC has a TPM 2.0.
 
## What is a TPM?
 
In simple words, a TPM is a small chip that is usually embedded on the motherboard of computers. It is used to store encryption keys, credentials, and sensitive data.
 
Windows offers multiple ways to check if your PC has TPM. Following are the five easy ways to check if your computer has TPM 2.0.

Method 1 of 5

 
## Check if your PC has TPM 2.0 in Windows 10/11
 
Step 1: In the Start/taskbar search field, type tpm.msc and then hit the Enter key.
 
If you get an error saying that it is not found, it means that your PC has no TPM or TPM is not activated in the BIOS/UEFI.
 
Step 2: If TPM is present, Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Management on Local Computer will open. The TPM Manufacturer Information section provides information about the Specification version, which is nothing but the TPM version. If your PC has TPM 2.0, the same will be shown in the Specification version.
 
Method 2 of 5

 
## Check if your PC has TPM 2.0 via Device Manager
 
If your PC has TPM and is not disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, the Windows Device Manager will display the same. Here is how to check.
 
Step 1: Open the Device Manager. There are many ways to open the Device Manager. On Windows 10/11, right-click on the Start button and then click the Device Manager to open the same.
 
Step 2: In the Device Manager, expand the Security Devices tree to view the TPM version. The absence of the Security Devices tree indicates that the TPM is turned off in the BIOS/UEFI or not present.
 
The TPM version will be shown at the end of the entry, as you can see in the picture below.
 
Method 3 of 5

 
## Check if your PC has TPM 2.0 using Command Prompt
 
Step 1: Open the Administrative Command Prompt. You can do this by typing CMD in the search, right-clicking on the Command Prompt entry, and then clicking the Run as administrator option.
 
Click the Yes button when you see the prompt.
 
Step 2: On the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command followed by the Enter key.
 
Step 3: The Specification version field displays the TPM version.
 
Method 4 of 5

 
## Check if your PC has TPM 2.0 using Windows Security
 
The built-in Windows Security app in Windows 10 can provide you information about TPM. Here is how to use it to know the TPM version.
 
Step 1: Open the Windows Security app using the Start/taskbar search.
 
Step 2: In the left pane, select Device Security.
 
Step 3: In the Security Processor section, click on the Security processor details link.
 
Step 4: In the Specifications section, the Specification version field displays your TPM version number.
 
Method 5 of 5
 
## Check if your PC has TPM using BIOS/UEFI
 
Note this method can only be used to check if your PC has TPM and not the TPM version.
 
Step 1: Restart your PC and get into the BIOS/UEFI. If you are not sure about accessing the BIOS/UEFI, refer to our how-to open BIOS/UEFI in Windows 10/11 guide.
 
Step 2: In the BIOS/UEFI, navigate to the Security tab. You should find the TPM, PTT, Intel Platform Trust Technology, Security chip, or fTPM (for AMD) if your PC supports TPM. If none of these options present, your PC likely does not come with a TPM.
 
If the TPM is disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, you can turn on the same.
 
## Can I add TPM to my PC?
 
This is the most frequently asked question ever since the announcement of Windows 11.
 
If your PC does not have TPM but meets all other hardware requirements (see Windows 11 system requirements) to install Windows 11, you might want to consider adding TPM to your computer. Unfortunately, this is only possible if your computer is a desktop computer. That is, laptop users cannot install a TPM card.
 
Before you buy a TPM for your PC, remember that your computer’s motherboard should carry a header for an add-in TPM card. Not all motherboards (even modern motherboards) offer a header to add an add-in TPM card. So, it is a good idea to check your PC’s manual or contact the manufacturer to make sure that your PC’s motherboard has a provision for an add-in TPM card. And if your motherboard supports a TPM card, you can buy and install the same. There are plenty of detailed guides available on the internet.
