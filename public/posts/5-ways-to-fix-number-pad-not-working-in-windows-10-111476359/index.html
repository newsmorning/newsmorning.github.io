And the number pad not working problem is no different.</p><p>Most of the time, the generic drivers for your PC’s hardware and peripherals are not properly updated by the system. There are key differences between a generic driver and a manufacturer’s driver.Searching for the right driver version for each of your hardware components can become tedious. That’s why an automated assistant can help you find and update your system with the correct drivers every time, and we strongly recommend DriverFix. Here’s how to do it:</p><ul><li>Download and install DriverFix.</li><li>Launch the software.</li><li>Wait for the detection of all your faulty drivers.</li><li>DriverFix will now show you all the drivers that have issues, and you just need to select the ones you’d liked fixed.</li><li>Wait for the app to download and install the newest drivers.</li><li>Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.</li></ul><p>Disclaimer: this program needs to be upgraded from the free version in order to perform some specific actions.</p><h3 id=driverfix>DriverFix<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#driverfix>#</a></h3><p>Keep your PC components drivers working perfectly without putting your PC at risk.</p><ul><li>Fix the # key not working on your computer</li><li>How to fix keyboard typing wrong characters/letters</li><li>How to Fix A Specified Logon Session Does not Exist [3 Ways]</li></ul><p>Hence, the first thing to do when you face this problem on Windows 11 is to disable the Mouse keys.

If you need a number pad, you can always buy it separately.</p><h3 id=how-can-i-test-if-my-keyboard-keys-are-working>How can I test if my keyboard keys are working?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-can-i-test-if-my-keyboard-keys-are-working>#</a></h3><p>Just open a new document and start typing to test if your keys are working.

They work with special keys, so you’ll always know if your keys are working correctly.</p><h3 id=how-do-i-reset-my-keyboard-back-to-normal>How do I reset my keyboard back to normal?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-i-reset-my-keyboard-back-to-normal>#</a></h3><ul><li>Press the Windows key + I to launch the Settings app.</li><li>Select the Time & Language option.</li><li>Click Language on the left pane.</li><li>Scroll under the Preferred languages and click a different language from the first one.</li><li>Click the up arrow to make the language the preferred option.</li><li>Finally, move your initial preferred language back up.</li><li>This will reset your keyboard settings to default.</li></ul><p>Above, you have a couple of solutions to fix your number pad if it is not functioning correctly on your Windows 10 device.</p><p>Remember that if you have a hardware failure on the keyboard, it would be best to purchase a new PC keyboard and replace your old one.</p><p>Have you found other ways to fix this issue on your PC?
