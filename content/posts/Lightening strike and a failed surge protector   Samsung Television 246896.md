Title: What Happened When A Lightning Strike Took Down A Samsung Television – The Shocking Truth About Failed Surge Protectors!

Subheading: Discover How A Failed Surge Protector Can Destroy Your Electronics During A Thunderstorm

Introduction:

Lightning storms are a common occurrence during the summer months, and they can be a danger to your electronics. Many of us have experienced a sudden power surge or outage during a thunderstorm, which can fry our devices beyond repair. In this article, we will explore what happened when a lightning strike took down a Samsung television and the shocking truth about failed surge protectors.

Section 1 – The Lightning Strike:

A couple living in a suburban home in Portland, Oregon were enjoying a summer evening when a thunderstorm hit their neighborhood. They were watching a movie on their Samsung Smart TV when suddenly there was a bright flash of light followed by a loud boom. The couple freaked out as they witnessed the lightning bolt hit a tree outside their windows. This lightning bolt caused an electrical surge that travelled through the house and hit their TV which was plugged into a surge protector.

Section 2 – The Aftermath:

After the storm passed, the couple inspected the damage to their home. They noticed that their Samsung TV was completely fried and beyond repair. The couple was confused as they had made sure to plug their TV and other electronics into surge protectors. They had expected that the surge protectors would have protected their devices from any power spike. However, that was not the case. They soon discovered that the surge protector they had been using was faulty and had failed to protect the TV from the electrical surge.

Section 3 – The Shocking Truth:

The couple's experience is not an isolated one. Many people assume that surge protectors will help protect their electronics from power surges and electrical spikes during a thunderstorm. However, faulty or outdated surge protectors can actually increase the risk of damage to your devices during a lightning strike.

When it comes to protecting your electronics during a thunderstorm, it's essential to make sure that you choose the right surge protectors. Look for surge protectors with higher joule ratings, as they have a better ability to absorb and divert power surges. Investing in surge protectors can save you money in the long run, as it is more affordable to replace a surge protector than to replace your electronic devices if they get damaged.

Section 4 – Conclusion:

In conclusion, your electronic devices are at risk during a thunderstorm, especially if you have not invested in proper surge protection. Don't assume that just because you have a surge protector that your devices will be safe. Do your research and choose the right surge protectors to help reduce the risk of damage to your electronics.

The scary truth is that lightning strikes are unpredictable and can cause a great amount of damage. It's always a good idea to unplug all of your electronic devices during a storm if possible. While this may seem like a hassle, it can prevent a lot of frustration and grief if your electronics get damaged during a thunderstorm.

Remember, don't take chances when it comes to protecting your electronics. Invest in proper surge protection and use common sense during a thunderstorm to safeguard your valuable devices.

## Chosen Solution
 Lost 4 electronic devices on the circuit. Samsung TV has a flashing standby light, some blinks are faint and some blinks are bright in a random no pattern order. I need some basic troubleshooting steps/advice  model UN65H6350AF

So shortly after posting this question, I went ahead pulled the power supply board and noticed it was charred In the top left corner (in pic) right behind the plug input. I replaced the power supply board as of today, and the main board is making an intermittent “spinning” sound. Coincides with the flashing standby. I believe you are correct with the main board suggestion and I think this may be part of the problem.
Also, there seems to be multiple part numbers on this main board.

 Hi,
Was the TV turned on at the time or just in a standby state?
If it was in a standby state, this may have limited the amount of damage due to the power surge.
If it was on the damage may be more extensive.
Disconnect the power from the Tv and then take the back cover off and inspect the power board for any obvious signs of damage. i.e. burnt or blown components. Also check over the other boards as well to be sure.
If in doubt or not sure, post some close up pictures of the boards and hopefully someone may be able to assist.
Here's how to do this. Adding images to an existing question
Also depending on the make and model and age of the surge protector, "some" manufacturers of surge protectors offer cover to electrical devices damaged by transient voltages (their term)
Here's an example only of what I mean
It may be worth checking if this is available on your particular surge protector.
Just a thought

 drapsag99   Samsung does not officially use blink codes for error codes. In your case, remove the back of your TV and take a look at the boards. Since your standby LED is flashing it is entirely possible that this is a main board failure. Like @jayeff mentioned, post some good pictures with your question so we can see what you see.

not quite sure what you got going on here. Your main board appears to have some water stains (high humidity?) as well as some dark areas (overheating?). See if you can provide us with some pictures that show a better view of both sides of the board as well as all the other boards.
