If you’re like most people, you use your computer for basic tasks like browsing the web, sending emails, and maybe playing some games. However, your Windows 8 computer has a lot more potential than you might think. By accessing some of the hidden Command Prompt commands, you can perform a range of advanced functions that can increase efficiency, speed up processes, and even troubleshoot problems. In this article, we’ll explore 10 hidden Command Prompt commands that can help you get the most out of your Windows 8 computer.\n1. Tasklist Have you ever wondered what processes are running on your computer and how much memory they’re using? Tasklist is a Command Prompt command that provides this information. Simply type “tasklist” into the Command Prompt and hit enter to see a list of all active processes, their process IDs, and the amount of memory each is using.\n2. Ipconfig If you’re troubleshooting internet connectivity issues, Ipconfig is a helpful Command Prompt command to know. By typing “ipconfig” into the Command Prompt, you’ll receive information about your computer’s IP address, DNS server, and default gateway, which can help you troubleshoot connectivity problems.\n3. Ping Ping is a Command Prompt command that enables you to test your network connectivity. By typing “ping” followed by an IP address or domain name, you can test the connection between your computer and that endpoint.\n4. Telnet Telnet is a Command Prompt command that allows you to remotely access another computer. If you have the network address of another computer, you can use Telnet to connect to it from your own computer.\n5. Sfc /scannow If you’re experiencing issues with your Windows 8 operating system, Sfc /scannow is a Command Prompt command you should know. It scans your system files and replaces any that are corrupted or missing.\n6. Netstat Netstat is a Command Prompt command that shows you all active network connections on your computer. This information can help you determine which programs are using your network connection and how much bandwidth they’re consuming.\n7. Robocopy Robocopy is a Command Prompt command that enables you to copy files and directories from one location to another. It offers more features than the standard copy command, including the ability to copy only files that have changed since the last copy.\n8. Cipher Cipher is a Command Prompt command that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files on your hard drive. This is a useful feature if you’re working with sensitive data and want to ensure it remains secure.\n9. Systeminfo Systeminfo is a Command Prompt command that provides detailed information about your system hardware, software, and configuration. This information can be helpful if you’re upgrading your computer or need to troubleshoot issues.\n10. Taskkill Taskkill is a Command Prompt command that allows you to terminate a process or program that’s frozen or otherwise unresponsive. Simply type “taskkill” followed by the process ID or name and hit enter to terminate the program.\nIn conclusion, by using some of these hidden Command Prompt commands, you can unlock the full potential of your Windows 8 computer. From troubleshooting connectivity problems to encrypting files, these commands allow you to perform a range of advanced functions that can help you work more efficiently and productively.\nThe Command Prompt available in Windows 8 contains access to around 230 command line commands. These commands are used for a variety of purposes, including diagnosing and correcting certain Windows problems, automating tasks, and much more.\nAvailability of Command Prompt Commands A number of these commands are very similar to MS-DOS commands. However, the Command Prompt in Windows 8 is not MS-DOS, so the commands are not correctly referred to as MS-DOS commands. We do have this Complete List of MS-DOS Commands if you really are using MS-DOS and are interested.\nSimilarly, not all Command Prompt commands are carried over to new Windows operating systems as they are released. So while the CMD commands listed in the table below apply to Windows 8, some might not be available in Windows 11, or Windows XP, etc.\nSee our Command Availability Across Microsoft Operating Systems list for every command ever available, from MS-DOS through Windows 11. It clearly shows which versions of Windows supports which commands. We also have lists detailing commands that are specific to other versions of Windows: Windows 7 commands and Windows XP commands.\nList of Command Prompt Commands for Windows 8 Below is a complete list of commands, sometimes called CMD commands, that are available from the Command Prompt in Windows 8:\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\nWindows 7 Command Prompt Commands\nCommand Availability Across Microsoft Operating Systems\nThe Complete List of Command Prompt (CMD) Commands\nHow to Open Command Prompt (Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, etc.)\nWindows XP Command Prompt Commands\nRun Commands in Windows 7\nThe Ultimate, Complete List of MS-DOS Commands\nCommand Prompt: What It Is and How to Use It\nHow to Use Advanced Startup Options in Windows\nHow to Access Device Manager From the Command Prompt\nHow to Open an Elevated Command Prompt\nHow to Change Directories in CMD (Command Prompt)\nRecovery Console: What It Is \u0026 a List of Commands\nHow to Use the Netstat Command\nVol Command Examples and Options\nHow to Open Disk Management From Command Prompt\nFacebook\nTwitter\nHit Refresh on Your Tech News\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nEditorial Guidelines\nTerms of Use\nCareers\nAdvertise\nContact\nEU Privacy\nNEWS\nHOW TO\nFEATURES\nABOUT US\n","wordCount":"928","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vincent Jett"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/list-of-windows-8-command-prompt-commands1131889/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You've been using Windows 8 all wrong - unlock its full potential with these hidden Command Prompt commands!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 9, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;928 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Vincent Jett</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-tasklist>1.
