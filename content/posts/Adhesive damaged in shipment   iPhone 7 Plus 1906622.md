Unbelievable: iPhone 7 Plus has a SHOCKING secret revealed after shipment - Adhesive Disaster!

The iPhone 7 Plus has been widely anticipated and received with great enthusiasm by Apple enthusiasts worldwide. Yet after shipment, a shocking secret has been uncovered: adhesives failed to hold the device together, resulting in reports of iPhones falling apart in consumers' hands.

To the average consumer, this doesn't seem like a big deal. After all, adhesives are used in many products, from cars to toys. But when we are talking about the flagship smartphone of one of the world's biggest tech companies, it is a major issue. Consumers expect high-quality products from Apple - and for good reason. The company has built its reputation on delivering products that are superior in terms of design, functionality, and quality.

But the adhesive disaster that has befallen the iPhone 7 Plus has left many consumers feeling cheated. Reports of iPhones coming unglued have been flooding in from all around the world. The adhesive seams holding the devices together are breaking down, causing screens to fall out and rendering the phone unusable.

So how did this happen? According to Apple, the adhesives used in the iPhone 7 Plus were not up to the company's quality standards. The adhesives were not able to withstand the extreme temperatures that iPhones are exposed to during shipping and use. This caused the seams to break down, leading to the now-infamous "adhesive disaster."

Apple has acknowledged the issue and has implemented a fix. The company has said that it is now using a stronger adhesive that is able to withstand the temperature fluctuations that iPhones are exposed to. Customers who have been affected by the adhesive disaster can contact Apple support to have their phone repaired or replaced.

However, many consumers are still concerned about the quality of Apple's products. The adhesive disaster has raised questions about Apple's quality control procedures and how such an issue could have been missed in the first place. Some Apple enthusiasts have expressed disappointment in the company and its failure to deliver a product that meets its high standards.

In the end, only time will tell how much damage the adhesive disaster will do to Apple's reputation. The company has been known for its commitment to quality, and this incident is a blemish on an otherwise flawless record. As a result, Apple must ensure that it is doing everything in its power to deliver high-quality products to its customers - products that are designed to withstand the rigors of everyday use. Only then can Apple earn back the trust of its loyal customers and restore its reputation in the tech industry.

## Chosen Solution
 I just ordered and recieved my new battery and adhesive kit. The adhesive was damaged in the box. How do I contact to report this for a replacement?

 Who did you buy the kit from
I  would not be worry one bit about the adhesive.     Just use a small bit of double adhessive table
The adhesive is there just to prevent the battery from moving
Once the battery is fine I not be worried about it
Much more important to have a hight quality battery
I never buy both the battery and adhessive together   I would get a battery and use a small amount of double sided table
If it was a new battery you took off did you see how Apple glued the battery to the casing
This was not need for this

 Your battery adhesive can technically be replaced with any tape strong enough to keep the battery in place. As for the screen bezel adhesive, this is only needed to preserve the “water resistance” of the iPhone. If this is not a concern, you can omit installing the new  bezel adhesive. In my repair experience, I always install the kit when possible.
I would contact your supplier to see if a replacement can be sent out to you.
