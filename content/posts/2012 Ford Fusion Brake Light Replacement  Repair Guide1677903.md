## Why would the brake light on my 2012 Ford Fusion stop working?

Different reasons could cause the brake light on your 2012 Ford Fusion to stop working. Some of the most common causes include:

3. Check the brake light switch: Locate the brake light switch under the brake pedal and check if it's working correctly. If it's not, you'll need to replace it.

Once you've identified the problem, here's how you can fix it:

1. Replace the bulb: If the brake light bulb is burned out, you need to remove the old bulb and replace it with a new one.
