You Won't Believe What's Hiding Under the Screen of This Apple iPad Pro and It's Still Working Perfectly Fine!

Do you know what's hiding underneath the screen of your precious Apple iPad Pro? Most of us don't really bother to think about it as long as it's working perfectly fine. But here's a story that might make you wonder about the hidden secrets and technology that power your favorite handheld device.

Meet Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, a popular website that specializes in repairing and dismantling electronic gadgets. Recently, Wiens got his hands on a damaged iPad Pro that had a cracked screen. As you might expect, he decided to take it apart and see what's inside.

What he found was truly surprising. Underneath the display, he discovered a complex array of components that work in perfect harmony to make your iPad Pro function so seamlessly. From the processor to the RAM to the battery and the speakers, every piece was intricately designed and engineered to deliver top-notch performance.

But that's not all. Wiens also discovered something unexpected - a thin layer of copper tape that covered the entire back of the iPad Pro's display panel. This tape is not visible to the naked eye, but upon closer inspection, shows a network of intricate circuitry that serves as a grounding mechanism for the device.

What's even more fascinating is that this copper tape had a small tear in it, right in the middle of the screen. Despite this damage, the iPad Pro was still working as it should, and Wiens was amazed by its resilience.

"What's interesting is that this tear in the tape didn't affect the touchscreen's functionality at all," Wiens explains. "If this same thing happened on your phone or computer, you would notice it right away. But for the iPad Pro, it just kept working."

This discovery is a testament to the durability and reliability of Apple's engineering and design prowess. As we increasingly rely on our devices for work, communication, entertainment, and everything in between, it's reassuring to know that they can withstand some wear and tear without compromising their performance.

Of course, this doesn't mean that you should start intentionally damaging your iPad Pro or any other device. Rather, it's a reminder to appreciate the complex technology that powers the gadgets we use every day, and to be mindful of taking care of them so that they can keep working for years to come.

If you ever find yourself in the market for a new iPad Pro, or any other electronic device, remember that there's more to it than meets the eye. Take the time to learn about the components and features that make it unique, and consider investing in quality products that are built to last.

In conclusion, the hidden technology and secrets that power your iPad Pro may be a mystery to most of us, but they're worth marveling at. Perhaps the next time you use your iPad Pro, you'll have a newfound appreciation for the intricate systems that make it possible. And who knows, maybe you'll be inspired to take it apart and discover its hidden wonders for yourself!

## Chosen Solution
 The bottle cap wasn’t secured on a bottle of fragranced spirit that I burn and use as a diffuser, and I never realised it went all over my iPad. It looks awful on screen, kind of a wet look, but the speaker and touch and everything else is fine it seems, any ideas what the actual damage is? I have attached a picture to show.
Many thanks,Jake

 I am a beginner repairman but if your screen protector is a plastic one water could get under that and get trapped between the glass and the plastic. Don’t take my word for it though, wait for a smarter person to comearound.
