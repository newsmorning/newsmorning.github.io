# Say Goodbye to Expensive Dealership Repairs: Learn How to Fix Your 2019 Nissan Sentra Keyless Remote Battery With This Simple Guide!

If you own a 2019 Nissan Sentra, you're likely well-versed in the convenience of the keyless remote system. With just a push of a button, you're able to unlock your car, start the engine, and even open the trunk without ever using your key. But what happens when your keyless remote stops working? Instead of paying an expensive dealership repair bill, you can learn how to replace the keyless remote battery yourself with this simple guide.

## Step 1: Obtain the Correct Battery

Before you begin, you'll need to ensure that you have the correct battery for your keyless remote. In the case of a 2019 Nissan Sentra, you'll need a CR2032 battery.

## Step 2: Open the Keyless Remote

Using a small flathead screwdriver, carefully pop open the keyless remote. Be sure to do this over a soft surface, so that you don't lose any small pieces that may fall out.

## Step 3: Locate the Battery

Once your keyless remote is open, you'll see the battery compartment. Carefully remove the old battery, taking note of the positive and negative sides.

## Step 4: Insert the New Battery

Next, insert the new CR2032 battery into the keyless remote with the positive side facing up. Make sure that the battery is securely in place, but don't force it as this can damage the remote.

## Step 5: Close the Keyless Remote

Finally, snap the keyless remote back together. Test your new battery by using your keyless remote to unlock your car, start the engine, and open the trunk.

In just five simple steps, you can save yourself from an expensive dealership repair bill by replacing the keyless remote battery in your 2019 Nissan Sentra. Not only will you save money, but you'll also feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that you were able to fix the problem yourself.

## Introduction
 
A functioning battery allows your car to receive signals from the keyless remote to perform functions such as unlocking and locking car doors, opening the trunk, and most importantly, starting the car.
 
The 2019 Nissan Sentra is a push-to-start vehicle and in order to start the car, the key must be in close proximity. Without a functioning battery, the car will not be able to receive signals from the keyless remote to know it is in proximity to start the car.
 
It is important to replace the battery as soon as possible.
