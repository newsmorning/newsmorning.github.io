STOP EDGE FROM CRASHING FOREVER: 9 Life-Saving Fixes to Solve Your Microsoft Edge Meltdown!

Are you tired of constant crashes and freezes in Microsoft Edge? Do you feel like giving up on the web browser altogether? Don't worry; you are not alone. Edge crashing is a common issue that many users face, but it doesn't have to be this way. In this article, we'll discuss nine life-saving fixes that will help you solve your Microsoft Edge meltdown and put an end to your browser woes.

1. Clear Cache and Cookies

The first step in fixing Edge's crashing issue is clearing the browser's cache and cookies. Cache and cookies can pile up over time and slow down your browser's performance. To clear this data, go to Settings > Privacy, Search, and Services > Choose What to Clear. Tick the boxes for cache and cookies and select 'Clear Now.'

2. Disable Extensions

Extensions can make your browsing experience more enjoyable, but some of them can cause crashes or slow down your browser's performance. To disable extensions, click the three-dotted menu > Extensions > Manage Extensions. From there, toggle off any extensions that aren't essential.

3. Run System File Checker

System file checker is a built-in tool in Windows that checks for missing or corrupted system files. These files can cause issues with Edge's stability. To run the tool, search for 'cmd' in the start menu and open the command prompt as an administrator. Then, type 'sfc /scannow' and press enter.

4. Adjust Power Settings

Windows power settings can affect your device's performance and cause issues with Edge's stability. To adjust the settings, go to Settings > System > Power & Sleep > Additional Power Settings. From there, choose a power plan that fits your needs and requirements.

5. Update Your Drivers

Outdated drivers can cause issues with Edge's performance. To update drivers, go to Device Manager > find the driver that requires updating > right-click and select 'Update Driver.'

6. Reset Your Browser

Resetting your browser can fix any issues caused by corrupted data or broken settings. To reset Edge, go to Settings > Reset Settings > Restore Settings to their default values.

7. Update Windows

Updates can fix bugs and security vulnerabilities that may cause issues with Edge's stability. To update Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Check for Updates.

8. Disable Hardware Acceleration

Hardware acceleration uses your device's graphics card instead of the CPU to improve browser performance. However, it can also cause crashes or freezes. To disable hardware acceleration, go to Settings > System > Display > Graphics Settings > Graphics Performance Settings > turn it off.

9. Upgrade Your Hardware

If all else fails, it may be time to upgrade your hardware. Your device's age or outdated hardware may cause issues with Edge's performance. Consider upgrading to a device with better specifications to avoid these issues.

In conclusion, Edge crashing is a common issue, but it can be solved using these nine life-saving fixes. By following these steps, you can improve your browser's performance and keep it from crashing forever. Try these fixes out today and say goodbye to Edge's meltdown!

Microsoft Edge is the default browser in Windows 10. It was designed to replace Internet Explorer and compete with current browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. 
 
If you’ve had an issue with Microsoft Edge crashing, there are a few steps you can take. 
 
In this article, we’ll cover how you can prevent Microsoft Edge from crashing. We’ll start with the easiest fixes and progress to more time consuming approaches, so progress through this list in order to (hopefully) save time. 
 

 
## Why Is Microsoft Edge Crashing? 
 
The most common reason for Microsoft Edge crashing is browser extensions causing incompatibilities with the browser itself. Crashing can also be caused by corrupted Windows files, corrupted Microsoft Edge field, or a corrupted browser cache. 
 
## Change the Default Search Engine from Google
 
For some reason, having Google as the default search engine in the Microsoft Edge browser can cause it to crash. 
 
- Open Microsoft Edge.Click on the menu at the upper right corner (the three dots).

 
- Select Settings > Privacy, Search, and Services.Scroll down to the bottom and select Address bar and search.Click on the drop down box and select an option other than Google.

 
## Turn Off Search Suggestions
 
Some users have noted that turning off search suggestions prevents the Microsoft Edge browser from crashing. 
 
- Open Microsoft Edge.Click on the menu at the upper right corner (the three dots).Select Settings > Privacy, Search, and Services.Scroll down to the bottom and select Address bar and search.Click the two boxes next to Show me search and site suggestions using my typed characters and Show me suggestions from history, favorites and other data on this device using my typed characters.

 
- Restart Microsoft Edge

 
## Clear Cache and Cookies
 
As noted above, a corrupted cache can cause Microsoft Edge to crash. Here’s how to clear your cache. 
 
- Open Microsoft Edge.Click on the menu at the upper right corner (the three dots).Select Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Manage and delete cookies and site data > See all cookies and site data.

- Select the Start button and select Settings.

 
- Select Update & Security > Windows Update > Check for updates.

 
Note: Sometimes Windows updates can get stuck. Follow these tips if this happens to you. 
 
## Disable Microsoft Edge Extensions
 
Sometimes Microsoft Edge extensions, like ad-blockers, can develop incompatibilities with other extensions or with the browser itself. To see whether this is the cause of your crashing, disable all of the extensions at once and see if it fixes the crashing. If it does, you can then enable extensions you need one-by-one. 
 
- Open Microsoft Edge.Click on the menu at the upper right corner (the three dots).Select Extensions.Disable or remove all extensions by clicking the blue bar or selecting Remove.

 
## Reset to Microsoft Edge Default Settings

- A user account control notification will pop up asking you to allow permission to make changes to your device.Select Yes > Repair.

 
- Allow the installer to repair the app and then restart Microsoft Edge.

 
## Reinstall Microsoft Edge
 
Because Microsoft Edge is part of Windows, you cannot uninstall and reinstall it via Add or Remove Programs. This is the most involved method for fixing browser crashes and all other fixes should be attempted before this one. It’s recommended that you create a system restore point before attempting this fix. You will need to restart your PC in safe mode. 
 
#### Step 1: Restart your PC in safe mode
 
- Press the Windows + I keys together. This should open the Settings app. Select Update & Security.

 
- Select Recovery in the left sidebar.Under Advanced Startup select Restart now.

 
- Your PC will restart into the Choose an option screen. Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart.

 
- Type 4 to enter safe mode.

 
#### Step 2: Delete the Microsoft Edge Package folder
 
- Press Windows + R. This should open the run command box. Type: %localappdata%\Packages\ and hit enter.

 
- Find the folder “Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe” and delete it.

 
Note: You can also simply rename this folder to something else.
 
#### Step 3: Restart Windows and Reinstall Microsoft Edge
 
First, restart Windows in normal mode. 
 
Windows may automatically reinstall Microsoft Edge. You can check if this is the case by opening Microsoft Edge once. If it crashes and closes, attempt to open Microsoft Edge one more time after a brief break. If it opens and runs smoothly then it’s been reinstalled. If not, proceed with the following steps. 
 
- Hit Start and type Powershell.Right-click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.

 
- Type the following command into the PowerShell window and then press Enter:

 
Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | ForEach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
 
- Close PowerShell and restart your computer one more time. Open Microsoft Edge and see if it runs without crashing.

 
## Change Your Browser
 
Okay, this one’s a bit tongue-in-cheek, but if Microsoft Edge isn’t working for you, there’s plenty of other options out there. Take a look at Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Opera.
