Is your LG Television driving you crazy? Here's the one simple trick to solve your Change Over Board Problem!

Have you ever been in the middle of watching your favorite TV show, only to be interrupted by the dreaded "change over board problem"? This issue can be frustrating and a real pain, especially when you don't know how to fix it. However, don't worry, as we've got you covered with one simple trick that will help you resolve the problem in no time.

Before we dive into the solution, let's first understand what the change over board problem is. In an LG television, the change over board is responsible for switching between different input sources, such as HDMI, AV, and others. The problem arises when the board fails to function correctly, leading to a glitchy, unstable, and distorted display. This can be a result of several factors, ranging from a software glitch to a hardware issue.

Now that we've got that out of the way, let's take a look at the one simple trick that will help you resolve this issue on your LG television. The first thing you need to do is to locate the change over board inside your TV. This board is usually located at the back or at the side of your television and can be identified by the wires connecting it to other parts of the TV.

Next, disconnect the change over board from the TV by gently pulling out the wires connected to it. Make sure you mark each wire or take a picture to ensure that you reconnect them correctly later on.

Once you've disconnected the board from the TV, use a soft-bristled brush to remove any dust, dirt, or debris from the board's surface. Be gentle and careful not to damage or break any of the components on the board.

After you've cleaned the board, use a dry cloth or compressed air to remove any excess dust or debris that may have stuck to the surface. You can also use a cleaning solution specially designed for electronic components if necessary.

Once you've cleaned the board, reconnect the wires to their correct positions, making sure not to mix them up. Finally, turn on your TV to check if the change over board problem has been resolved.

In most cases, this simple trick should help you fix the change over board problem on your LG television. However, if the issue persists, it may be time to call in an expert or get a replacement board to fix the problem.

In conclusion, the change over board problem can be a major annoyance for LG TV owners. However, with the one simple trick we've discussed in this article, you should be able to solve the issue quickly and easily. We hope this article has been helpful, and happy TV watching!

 Brian Hill never a good idea to try and make boards fit. You eventually will run into trouble with that and something will not work. Thee is always a chance that the particular board you have may actually be compatible. For that you will have to give us the numbers of the board. Should be something like EBT62359778 (EAX65049104(1.0)). When in doubt post some images of your board with your question. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that  The main board for the 50LN5400 is always available somewhere like this or even better on here
