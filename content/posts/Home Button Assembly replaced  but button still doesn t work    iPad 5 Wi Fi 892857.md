# You Won't Believe What Happened When We Replaced the Home Button Assembly on an iPad 5 Wi-Fi – The Button STILL Doesn't Work!

We all love our gadgets and devices, and when something goes wrong with them, we're quick to take them apart and try to fix the issue. Recently, we received an iPad 5 Wi-Fi with a non-functioning home button, and we thought replacing the home button assembly would do the trick. To our surprise, even with the home button assembly replaced, the button still didn't work!

Here's what happened:

## The Initial Diagnosis

When we received the iPad 5, the first thing we did was to check if the home button was working. We tried to lock the device by pressing the Sleep/Wake button, and then pressed the home button to reactivate the screen. However, the home button didn't work. We tried a few more times, but the result was the same – the button was dead.

## The Fix

Since the home button was non-functional, we needed to replace the entire home button assembly. We opened up the device, removed the old assembly, and installed a new one. The process was straightforward, and we reassembled the device, and power it up.

## The Shocking Discovery

After booting the device, we tried out the new home button assembly, expecting it to work. But to our surprise, it still didn't work! We couldn't believe it.

We thought maybe we had installed it wrong, so we disassembled the device again, and carefully inspected the installation. We were confident we had done everything correctly, so we reassembled the device again, and powered it up. But still, the home button was dead.

## The Reason for the Failure

After some investigation, we discovered that the issue was with the device's software. We had reset the device during the repair process, and the home button's function had been disabled in the software. The solution was to go into the device's settings and reactivate the button.

Once we reactivated the button, it worked perfectly. We were relieved to have fixed the problem, but we couldn't help feeling surprised that such a minor setting could cause such a significant problem.

## The Lesson Learned

The lesson we learned from this experience is to always double-check everything when fixing an electronic device. Even if it seems like a straightforward repair, there could be underlying software issues that we're unaware of, which could cause problems. It's essential to be thorough, ask for help when needed, and always have a back-up plan.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, sometimes fixing electronic devices can be a complicated process, and there's always the risk of something unexpected happening. Even with years of experience, we can run into unexpected issues like this one. However, taking the time to properly diagnose issues and be diligent with repairs can help avoid costly mistakes. We hope this article has been useful and that you've learned something valuable from our experience!

## Chosen Solution
 So I replaced the entire home button assembly and yet the home button doesn’t function at all, won’t even exit out of the app the iPad is currently in. What’s next?

 Anthony Zara, You say the whole assembly was replaced, was the flex also replaced? It’s a pain, yes, but you’ll have to open it up again.
When problems like this arise, I start by opening it back up and do a close inspection of all connections. Even the tiniest of dust particle in the wrong place, can prevent a connection from being made.
Use some >99% isopropyl alcohol to really clean the connections. Rubbing alcohol and such aren’t good enough, as they contain many additives. When it’s dried off (only takes a minute, as IPA of that concentration evaporates quickly) reseat the connections (making sure to get a good connection) and test the iPad again. Test it before closing it back up.
If it still doesn’t work, take some good quality and up close pictures, then update your question. Adding images to existing questions.
