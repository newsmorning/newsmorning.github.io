Title: Shocking Revelation: Dishwasher in Total Darkness Despite Pressing Buttons! Find Out Why!!

Introduction: When you press the buttons of your dishwasher, you expect it to work perfectly, cleaning your dishes and making your life easier. However, you may encounter a shocking revelation when despite pressing buttons, the dishwasher remains in total darkness. It can be frustrating, but understanding the reasons why it happens can help you resolve the issue easily.

1. Power supply: The first thing you should check is the power supply. If the dishwasher is not receiving power, it will remain in darkness, and none of the buttons will work. Check the circuit breaker, the wall switch, and the plugs to ensure that the dishwasher is receiving power. If the power supply is not the problem, move on to other possible causes.

2. Control Panel: Sometimes, the control panel of the dishwasher may have a malfunction. If the control panel is damaged or the wiring is loose, the dishwasher may remain in darkness. It is essential to check the control panel and the wiring to determine if that is the problem. If the control panel needs to be replaced, contact a professional technician to do it for you.

3. Timer: The timer of the dishwasher is responsible for controlling the cycle of the machine. If the timer is faulty, it may cause the dishwasher to remain in darkness. Check the timer and the wiring to determine if it is causing the issue. If the timer is damaged or it's not working correctly, it may need to be replaced.

4. Door Switch: The dishwasher's door switch ensures that the door is closed before the machine starts working. If the door is open or not closed correctly, the dishwasher will not work, and it may remain in darkness. Check the door switch to ensure it is working correctly. If the switch is damaged or loose, it may need to be replaced.

Conclusion: These are the possible reasons why your dishwasher may remain in darkness despite pressing buttons. By checking these causes and resolving the issue, you can ensure your dishwasher functions perfectly, making your life easier. If you encounter any problems that you cannot resolve, don't hesitate to contact a professional technician to help you. It's essential to maintain your dishwasher to ensure that it works correctly and avoid any issues that may cause inconvenience.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Whirlpool gold series Dishwasher - model number: WDT710PAYM5. Dishwasher won't start and no lights come on at touch pad. I've tried the two resets that I know of ("high heat" and "normal" buttons pressed 3 times within 3 seconds and unpluged the dishwasher for 1 minute and pluged back in) to no avail.  Power arriving to cord at receptacle (120v), and I am able to verify that power is arriving to the control panel, though I don’t know what to test beyond that to see if any power is arriving else where (door latch, buttons etc) High Limit Thermostat and heating element  test for continuity. (Unsure of where a fuse would be located on this model if there is one?) Suspect control panel is the problem. What steps are taken to test control panel or is replacement just the only option?  Also I assume if the multi-meter beeps that I can declare continuity (is that fair to say?)

 Hi,
Couldn’t find info for a WDT710PAYM5  but have found this tech sheet for a WDT710PAYM6 which I hope may be close enough to your model to be relevant and of some help.
It mentions that fuses are located on the underside of the control board and it has schematics and diagnostic testing information etc,
