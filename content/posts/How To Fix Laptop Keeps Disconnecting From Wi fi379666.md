What Causes Wi-Fi Connection Drops?
Before delving into the solutions to fix a constantly dropping Wi-Fi connection on your laptop, it's crucial to understand the reasons that can cause this issue. Here are some of the most common causes:

The first thing you should do is restart your router. This can help to clear any issues that may be causing the Wi-Fi connection drops. Switch off the router, wait for a minute, and turn it on again.

Step 2: Check for signal interference
If the router is not the issue, check for signal interference. Move your laptop closer to the router and see if the connection improves. If it does, signal interference may be the problem. Try moving your router to a more central location or investing in a Wi-Fi range extender.

If signal interference is not the issue, update your Wi-Fi drivers. Go to the manufacturer's website to download and install the latest drivers for your laptop's Wi-Fi card.
