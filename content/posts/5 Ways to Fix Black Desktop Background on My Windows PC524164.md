But what if your Windows desktop starts going black or looking dull due to some common issues? Don't worry; this article presents 5 simple solutions to keep it shining like new!

Main Body:
1. Adjust Screen Brightness: One of the causes of your Windows desktop going black could be the incorrect screen brightness settings. To adjust your screen brightness, press the Windows key + I, go to System -> Display, and adjust the brightness slider according to your preferences. You can also enable the Night Light feature that reduces blue light emission, making the screen more comfortable to view.

2. Update Graphics Drivers: Outdated graphics drivers can cause several problems, including black screen issues. Press Windows key + X and select Device Manager. Expand the "Display Adapters" drop-down, right-click on your graphics card, and choose "Update Driver." Alternatively, you can visit your graphics card manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers.

3. Check Power Settings: If your Windows desktop goes black when you're working on it, it could be a power-saving feature of your PC. Go to Control Panel -> Power Options, and make sure you've selected the "High Performance" power plan. This setting ensures that your PC doesn't go into sleep mode while you're actively using it.

4. Scan for Malware/Viruses: Malware and viruses can cause several problems, including black screen errors. Run a full scan of your computer using a reliable antivirus program such as Bitdefender, Norton, or Avast. Quarantine or delete any detected threats and restart your PC.

5. Reset Windows 10: If none of the above solutions work, you can try resetting your Windows 10 PC to its factory settings. This process removes all your files, programs, settings, and restores the original Windows installation. Go to Settings -> Update & Security -> Recovery, and click on "Get Started" under the "Reset this PC" section. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

Conclusion:
If your Windows desktop goes black or looks dull, don't panic. These 5 simple solutions will help you keep it shining like new. Adjusting screen brightness, updating graphics drivers, checking power settings, scanning for malware/viruses, and resetting Windows 10 can troubleshoot most black screen problems.

This black background issue is annoying, especially for those who have set the desired aesthetic image or customized wallpaper. Also, a user asked, My desktop background is black and I can’t change it.
 
Unfortunately, the newer versions of the Windows operating system are full of similar minor but annoying bugs, and Windows users are constantly complaining about them, but they’re right.
 
Luckily, you can quickly solve the desktop background that keeps going black in Windows 10 problem with just a few clicks, and we are presenting the steps in this article.
 
## Why does my desktop background go black?
 
The problem usually arises due to misconfigured settings, specifically the Show desktop background image setting. For many, it was disabled, and that led to the error.
 
Other underlying causes include an outdated graphics driver, contrast settings, and power options. However, the issues behind the desktop background going black are far lesser than other errors, which makes troubleshooting it a lot simpler.
 
#### Why does my desktop background keep disappearing on Windows 10?
 
This can happen if Windows keeps refreshing for some reason, and in most cases, the cause for this is the background processes, so be sure to disable them.
 
A few users reported that desktop icons are flashing, so disabling them might be a decent workaround that you could try.
 
In some instances, you might even see a flashing black box on Windows 10, and if this happens, it’s always a good idea to disable all startup applications.
 
## How can I fix the black desktop background on Windows 10?
 
### 1. Disable Desktop icons
 
- Right-click on the desktop, hover the cursor over View and uncheck the Show desktop icons option.
 - Again, right-click on the desktop, and select Personalize from the context menu.
 - If you are using a theme with a single wallpaper, select some themes with multiple wallpapers. For example, Microsoft’s Line and colors theme, and then switch back to the default theme.
 - Finally, you have to re-disable the Show desktop icons option.

 
Once done, verify if the desktop background turns black when highlighting in Windows 10 anymore. If yes, head to the following method.
 
### 3. Reconfigure the display settings
 
- Press Windows + I to open the Settings, and click on Ease of Access from the options here.
 - Now, locate the Show desktop background image option on the right and make sure the toggle under it is enabled.

### 2. Update drivers

 - Right-click on the graphics adapter and select Update driver from the context menu.
 - Select Search automatically for drivers in the new window.
 - Wait for the OS to locate and install the best available driver.

 
The Device Manager offers a relatively quick way to update the drivers. But it’s often not that effective since only the drivers available on the computer are looked through, while there may be an updated version available on the manufacturer’s website.
 
Of course, there is a way around this, known as an automatic driver update. This ensures that you have the correct driver patch downloaded and installed without issue.
 
DriverFix is designed to fix many issues caused by driver update failures. In addition, it can fix almost all sound problems and network failures.
