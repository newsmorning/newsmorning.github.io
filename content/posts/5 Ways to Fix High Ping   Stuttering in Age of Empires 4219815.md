Are you tired of being left behind in your favorite Age of Empires 4 game because of lag and stuttering? If yes, we have got you covered. Here are five easy tips to fix high ping and stuttering, and dominate your enemies in Age of Empires 4.

## 1. Check your internet connection

The first thing you should check is your internet connection. A poor internet connection can lead to high ping and stuttering, which can result in lost battles. Ensure that your internet connection is stable and fast enough to support the game. A bandwidth of at least 4 Mbps is recommended for smooth gameplay.

## 2. Update your drivers

Updating your drivers, especially your graphics card driver, can significantly improve game performance. An outdated driver can cause lag and stuttering in games, including Age of Empires 4. Check for driver updates and install them to ensure that your hardware is up to date and compatible with the game.

## 3. Lower your graphics settings

High graphics settings can put a strain on your system and lead to lag and stuttering. Lowering your graphics settings can help reduce the workload on your hardware, leading to smoother gameplay. Start by reducing your resolution and texture settings and gradually adjust other graphics settings until you find the optimal balance between performance and visuals.

## 4. Close unnecessary programs and background processes

Running unnecessary programs and background processes can eat up your system resources, causing gaming performance issues. Close all programs that are not necessary while playing Age of Empires 4, including web browsers, file-sharing software, and streaming services. Also, consider disabling background processes that may consume resources, such as antivirus scans, automatic updates, and system maintenance tasks while gaming.

## 5. Use a gaming VPN

Using a gaming VPN can help reduce ping and improve gaming performance in Age of Empires 4. A gaming VPN can route your traffic through a server closer to the game server, reducing latency and providing a faster connection. It can also protect your traffic from ISP throttling and allow you to bypass firewalls that may block game traffic.

## Conclusion

Now that you know how to fix high ping and stuttering in Age of Empires 4, it's time to put these tips into action and dominate your enemies. Check your internet connection, update your drivers, lower your graphics settings, close unnecessary programs and background processes, and use a gaming VPN to improve your gaming performance.
