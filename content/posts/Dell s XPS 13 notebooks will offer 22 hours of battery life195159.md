In terms of connectivity, the XPS 13 notebooks have two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a microSD card reader, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The notebooks also feature the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology, allowing users to connect to the internet at high speeds.

Overall, the XPS 13 notebooks are a game-changer in the laptop market, with their innovative design and groundbreaking battery life.

In conclusion, Dell's XPS 13 notebooks have taken the tech world by storm, and it is evident that they are here to stay. With their reliability, speed, and extreme battery life, the XPS 13 notebooks are sure to remain a favorite among laptop users for years to come.


Dell has revealed more details about the configuration of its upcoming XPS 13 notebooks, and confirmed they’ll be powered by Kaby Lake CPUs for top-notch performance. The company also confirmed that its XPS 13 notebooks would offer an impressive 22 hours of battery life on FHD and up to 13 hours on QHD+.
 
The XPS 13 notebooks are built for performance, mobility and visual fidelity, and will sport a virtually borderless InfinityEdge display as well. Dell will roll out two XPS 13 models:
 
- Intel 7th Generation Core i5; 8GB memory; 256GB SSD; 13.3-inch FHD
 - Intel 7th Generation Core  i7; 8GB memory; 256GB SSD; 13.3-inch QHD+ with Touch.

 
The only con we’ve identified about the upcoming notebooks is related to their Rose Gold color. Actually, the notebooks will be available only in this color, but we’re sure the impressive configurations will convince potential buyers to perceive the Rose Gold color only as a minor detail.
 

 
Other features include:
 
- New Killer 1535 Wireless-AC technology for strong and reliable WiFi connection
 - Dell’s exclusive virtually borderless and premium Full HD or UltraSharp QHD+ InfinityEdge display
 - Stunning 13.3-inch screen in an 11-inch frame
 - Smallest 13-inch notebook on the planet and 17 percent smaller than the comparable MacBook Air 13-inch. Starting at 2.7lb and measuring a super slim 9-15mm
 - Constructed with machined aluminum, carbon fiber and Corning Gorilla Glass for incredible durability and stunning design
 - Developer Edition also available, featuring Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

 
As far as the available date and price tag are concerned, XPS 13 and XPS 13 Developer Edition will be available starting from October 4 for $799 and $949 respectively.
 
The new Dell XPS 13 notebooks are definitely going to set the standard in terms of battery life if they manage to deliver the 22 hours of battery life. However, let’s take this information with a pinch of salt as we all know that most of the time, the real battery life is actually half of that announced.
 
Having a battery capable of delivering 22 hours of battery autonomy sounds like a dream, and fortunately we don’t have to wait that long to see if Dell is right.
