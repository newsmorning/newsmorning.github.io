Are you a new user looking to switch to an open-source Linux operating system? If so, two of the most popular choices are Linux Mint and Ubuntu. But which one is the better option for new users? In this article, we'll explore why Linux Mint might just be the perfect choice for you and how it beats Ubuntu hands down.

### First, what is Linux Mint?

Linux Mint is an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution that aims to provide a modern, elegant, and comfortable operating system for users. It's known for its user-friendly interface and out-of-the-box usability. Linux Mint offers various editions to cater to different user needs, such as Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce.

On the other hand, Ubuntu is often considered the flagship distribution of Linux that's aimed at providing a powerful and universal OS. However, Ubuntu's interface can sometimes be overwhelming, especially for new users.

### Why Linux Mint is the perfect choice for new users

#### User-friendliness

One of the main reasons why Linux Mint is a popular choice for new users is its user-friendly interface. It comes with the Cinnamon desktop environment that offers a Windows-like experience, making it easier for users to transition from Windows to Linux.

Additionally, Linux Mint's system settings are easy to navigate and modify, and its software center offers a curated selection of apps that are easy to install and use.

#### Customizability

Another great aspect of Linux Mint is its customization options. Unlike Ubuntu, Linux Mint doesn't have a vast array of customizations that can be overwhelming for new users. Instead, it provides subtle customization options that are easy to understand and implement.

For example, Linux Mint allows users to change the color scheme, icon style, and desktop wallpaper with just a few clicks. It's a perfect way for users to personalize their experience without getting lost in a sea of options.

#### Stability and reliability

Linux Mint is known for its stability and reliability. It's built on top of Ubuntu, which is a robust and reliable operating system. However, Linux Mint takes it a step further by offering additional features that improve the overall stability of the system.

For instance, Linux Mint comes with its update manager that ensures the system is up-to-date and secure. The update manager also allows users to choose which updates to install, giving them more control over their system.

### Conclusion

Overall, Linux Mint is an excellent choice for new users looking to switch to a Linux operating system. Its user-friendly interface, customizability options, stability, and reliability make it an attractive option compared to Ubuntu. Give it a try, and we're sure you won't be disappointed!

I have been using Ubuntu since 2006 and I always felt that it is one of the easiest to use distro, especially for new Linux users. That was in the past. Nowadays, when people ask me for recommendation, I would certainly recommend Linux Mint over Ubuntu, and here are the reasons.Note: This is mainly a comparison of Linux Mint and Ubuntu (unity version) and why I think Linux Mint is better. No offense to those who are using other distro and loving it.
 
## Cinnamon vs Unity
 
Canonical (the team behind Ubuntu) created a new desktop manager, also known as Unity and added their own customization to it. Similarly, Linux Mint also created their own version of desktop manager, also known as Cinnamon (a fork of Gnome 3) and use it for Linux Mint 13 and 14. The only difference between the two – Cinnamon gives a much better user experience than Unity.
 
The most impressive thing about Linux Mint is that during the transition from Gnome 2 to Gnome 3, they managed to keep the user interface consistent. Gnome Shell differs greatly from Gnome 2, both in the UI and the backend coding; and yet when Linux Mint created Cinnamon, they are able to retain the same UI found in their previous version. This means that users upgrading from an older version don’t have to spend money relearning the new interface.
 
As a long time Ubuntu user, I can’t get myself to like Unity. With Cinnamon, I love it the moment I started using it.
 
## Users First or Features First?
 
One thing that I noticed for both Linux Mint and Ubuntu is that one of them put their users first, while the other focuses on new features development rather than user experience.
 
The primary aim of Linux Mint is to “produce a modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use.“. I think they have definitely achieved the “easy to use” part. One of the key to make things easy to use is to keep it simple and consistent throughout. Apple’s iOS is a great example. What I am impress about Linux Mint is that the UI has been consistent throughout all its releases, even though the technology underlying it is totally different. This means that when I upgrade from one version to another, I won’t have to relearn everything again.
 
Ubuntu, on the other hand, has no fear of testing new grounds. They are willing to innovate and try new stuff. They are also willing to sacrifice user experience in the process of doing so.
 
The Dash is great, but it doesn’t make it easier for the users to search for apps. Pidgin was replaced with Empathy when it is still a half-baked product. They switched the default music player from Rhythmbox to Banshee, and only to go back to Rhythmbox again. They make Unity the default desktop manager when it is still buggy. They introduced the appindicator which blocked some notification icons from appearing in the system tray, and the list goes on…
 
Canonical has definitely done a great job innovating and some of their new features are really cool and useful. I only hope that in the process, they can do a better job integrating the new features without compromising the user experience.
 
## Customization
 
While there are some useful tools like Synapse (application launcher), Cairo dock, Ubuntu Tweak, that allows you to customize Ubuntu and make it easier to use, or switch to other desktop manager instead of Unity, the question is, why do you need such customization in the first place? If you need to make so many customization just to make it usable, then it is no longer usable at all.
 
Since Linux Mint is a variant of Ubuntu, all the customization that you did in Ubuntu will work in Linux Mint as well. However, while in Linux Mint, I don’t find myself doing a lot of customization as most of the things just work, or pre-installed. For sure, I won’t need to switch to another desktop manager in Linux Mint.
 
## Conclusion
 
As mentioned earlier, this is a comparison between Ubuntu (Unity version) and Linux Mint and why I think Linux Mint is better. The good thing about Linux is that there are plenty of distro out there and you can easily find the one you like. However, if you were to ask me for a recommendation, I would surely recommend Linux Mint over Ubuntu.
