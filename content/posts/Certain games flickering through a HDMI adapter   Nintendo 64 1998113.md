Huge Discovery! Nintendo 64 Games Flickering Uncontrollably Through HDMI Adapter – Here's Why!

Are you a fan of classic games and love the nostalgic feeling of playing your old Nintendo 64 (N64) games? Have you recently bought an HDMI adapter for your console and noticed that the games are flickering uncontrollably? Don't worry; you are not alone! Many gamers have reported the same issue, and we have the answers.

The Nintendo 64 was first introduced in 1996 and was a massive success, selling millions of units worldwide. The console was popular for its great graphics and advanced gameplay. However, the technology back then and today's advanced TV technology have a significant gap. The N64 used an analog output to connect to CRT televisions, while today's TVs use digital signals like HDMI.

To bridge this gap, many gamers took the HDMI adapter route. There are many HDMI adapters available in the market that allow you to connect your N64 to your modern TV. However, all HDMI adapters are not the same, and this is where the flickering issue comes into play.

The flickering issue is caused by the type of video output the N64 uses. The N64 uses a video output method called "interlaced." This method was standard in the late '90s but is now considered outdated. Modern TVs do not support interlaced video output, which is why the adapters struggle to translate the signal.

To solve this issue, you have two options. Firstly, you can buy a high-end HDMI adapter that supports interlaced video output. However, be prepared to spend quite a bit of money – these adapters can cost over $100.

The second option is the cheaper route – use an older TV. Yes, we know this sounds crazy, but it's true. The flickering issue is only an issue when using an HDMI adapter – playing directly on a CRT TV resolves the issue. Alternatively, gamers are now purchasing older CRT TVs or computer monitors to play their old games. These older screens support the necessary video output for the N64 and do not cause any issue.

To sum it up, the flickering issue that Nintendo 64 gamers face when using an HDMI adapter can be resolved by using a high-end adapter that supports interlaced video output, purchasing an older CRT TV or monitor, or simply sticking to the traditional analog output. We hope this article has helped you solve the issue and enjoy playing your old nostalgic games in today's world.


## Chosen Solution
 Please could someone explain why certain games are flickering when ran through my RCA to HDMI adapter. To explain in a little more detail I’m running my PAL N64 through an adapter to my 2019 Samsung 4k tv, nearly all games work fine and have a decent picture however 2 games that i’ve noticed (Super Smash Bros & Goldeneye) make the screen continually flicker and scroll. Thanks in advance

 Having the exact same problem with Mario 64/goldeneye after cleaning all console and cartridges. Did you manage to solve this? Thanks
