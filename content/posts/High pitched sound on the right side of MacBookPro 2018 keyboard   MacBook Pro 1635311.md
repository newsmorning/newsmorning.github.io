Title: Are You Hearing Mysterious High-Pitched Noises from Your MacBook Pro Keyboard? Here's What You Need to Know!

________________________________________

If you are using a MacBook Pro, have you ever encountered a mysterious high-pitched noise coming from your keyboard? This issue has been reported by many MacBook Pro users, and it's not just annoying - it may indicate that there is something wrong with your device.

In this article, we'll dive deeper into what causes the high-pitched noise from MacBook Pro keyboards and what you can do to fix it.

What Causes the High-Pitched Noise from MacBook Pro Keyboards?

First, let's talk about what causes the high-pitched noise. It's typically caused by the keyboard's backlighting feature. When the keyboard's backlight is turned on, it causes a small amount of electrical interference that generates a high-pitched noise.

While it may seem like a minor issue, this noise could be a sign of a more serious problem. It's possible that your MacBook Pro's cooling system is not functioning correctly, and the high-pitched noise is a symptom of overheating.

However, the most common cause is simply a design flaw. Early models of MacBook Pro had a design flaw that caused the noise to occur when the backlight was on. In newer models, Apple has addressed the design flaw, and the issue should not occur.

What Can You Do to Fix the High-Pitched Noise?

If you're experiencing the high-pitched noise, there are a few things you can try to fix it. First, you can try adjusting the backlight brightness. Lowering the brightness can reduce the electrical interference and, in turn, eliminate the noise.

If that doesn't work, you should consider taking your device to an authorized Apple service provider. They'll be able to conduct a thorough diagnosis to determine if there is an underlying problem causing the noise.

It's important to note that if you are still under warranty, the issue will be covered by Apple. If you're not covered, you may have to pay for any repairs out of pocket.

Conclusion

While the high-pitched noise from your MacBook Pro's keyboard is not a serious issue, it may indicate a problem with your device. If you're experiencing the noise, try adjusting the backlight brightness, and if it persists, take your device to an authorized Apple service provider.

By addressing this issue promptly, you can avoid potential damage to your device and ensure that it continues to function as it should. If you're still unsure about what to do, contact Apple support, and they can guide you in the right direction.

## Chosen Solution
 Few days ago I have bought new MacBook Pro 15” 2018.
I have little 'problem' with 'enter', 'right shift', and up/down arrows keys. In general use when I typing I can't  hear difference but when I pushing one of this keys singly I noticed that there are little louder than others.
Is this normal?
I have found some video:

which describing exatly what I ment.
Another info is that I have EU keyboard..

 All of the butterfly keyboards are noisy! The 3rd generation is a bit better but not by much! If you want a real quiet keyboard you’ll need to use an external Bluetooth keyboard or go back to the older 2013 retina series.
This was a very compromised design in order to offer as thin as possible design.
Sadly, in my opinion Apple went to far! Both with the butterfly keyboard and the i9 CPU should never have been used in this thin body design.
Better yet, scratch out the ‘Pro’ in the name and call it the MacBook for the executives (bling box) and create the real MacBook Pro laptop for the real working pro’s which this series does not serve. A quiet keyboard, big enough to give the system the needed space to offer the needed cooling as well as a larger battery and put back the missing ports: USB-A (2), SD slot & rip away power connector (a USB-C MagSafe built in).
