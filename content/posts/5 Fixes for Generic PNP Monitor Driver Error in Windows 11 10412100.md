When you connect a new monitor to your PC, you might get a generic PnP monitor error resulting from failure to detect that monitor. This can also happen after upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11. In most cases, this problem is driver-related, but it can also be caused by hardware or cable issues.

## What is Generic PnP Monitor
 
PnP stands for Plug and Play. This is what allows your computer system to automatically adapt to many of the hardware changes you make. Whenever you connect a monitor or any other external device, Windows should configure it for you. 
 

 
In most cases, you don’t have to manually install any drivers, thanks to the PnP system. But sometimes, the generic PnP monitor driver doesn’t work as it should, and it causes connectivity issues.

## 1. Check the Cable Connection
 
Before you start removing and reinstalling drivers, do a basic hardware checkup. Is your monitor cable properly connected? Unplug it and replug it. If you’re still using a VGA cable, make sure it’s firmly plugged in and the little screws are tightened.
 
Next, make sure this problem isn’t system-specific. Connect your monitor to a different PC or a laptop. If you have the same issue on another system, there’s something wrong with the monitor or cable. Try a different cable to rule out the possibility of a faulty cable.
 
## 2. Update the Generic PnP Monitor Driver
 
Right-click the Windows start button and open the Device Manager.    
 
Locate Generic PnP Monitor under Monitors. Right-click and select Update driver from the menu.
 
A new window will open that will ask you for the source of the drivers. Select the Search automatically for drivers option and follow the steps as instructed.
 
If you’re running a multi-monitor setup, you should update the Generic PnP Monitor driver for each monitor. Then, restart your computer once the driver has been updated.

Finally, restart your computer, and your monitor should work unless something else is causing the error.
 
## 4. Update Your Computer’s Display Adapters

Type cmd in the Windows search box to launch the Command Prompt app. Make sure you run it as the administrator; otherwise, you won’t be able to perform the system files check.
 
Type the following command and press Enter:
 
sfc /scannow
 
The utility will scan all Windows system files for errors or missing files. It can take a while, so be patient. Restart your computer, and your Generic PnP Monitor driver error should be no more.
