# Save Your Car and Your Wallet! Easily Replace Your 2012 Fiat 500 Lift Support with This Simple Repair Guide

If you own a 2012 Fiat 500, you know how important it is to keep your car in top condition. And one part that can wear out over time is your lift support. This component helps to hold up the hatchback or trunk lid when it's open, and when it fails, it can make loading and unloading your vehicle a hassle. Fortunately, replacing the lift support is a simple task that you can do yourself with just a few basic tools and this easy-to-follow guide. 

## Tools and Parts Required

Before you get started, you'll need to gather a few tools and parts. You'll need:

* A replacement lift support for your 2012 Fiat 500 (available at most auto parts stores or online)
* A flathead screwdriver
* A pair of pliers 

## Removing the Old Lift Support

1. Open the hatchback or trunk lid of your Fiat 500 and locate the lift support on one side (it's the black or silver bar that extends from the body of the car to the edge of the hatchback or trunk lid).
2. Take your flathead screwdriver and slide it between the ball joint on the lift support and the mounting bracket on the car (you'll see a small clip here that you can pry away).
3. Use your pliers to grab the clip and slide it off the ball joint.
4. Now you can remove the lift support from the mounting bracket by lifting it up and off.

## Installing the New Lift Support

1. Take your new lift support and slide the ball joint into the mounting bracket on the car, making sure it clicks securely into place.
2. Use your pliers to slide the clip back onto the ball joint, locking it into the mounting bracket.
3. Repeat this process with the other lift support on the opposite side of the car (if needed). 

## Testing the New Lift Support

To make sure your new lift support is working properly, you'll want to test it out. Open your hatchback or trunk lid and let it go, making sure the lift support holds it up without any sagging or difficulties. Then release the hatchback or trunk lid and make sure it closes smoothly without any resistance or binding.

## Conclusion

Replacing your 2012 Fiat 500 lift support is a simple and affordable repair that can save you time and money down the road. With just a few basic tools and this easy-to-follow guide, you can get your car back in top shape and ensure that loading and unloading your vehicle is a breeze. Remember to always prioritize safety when working on your car, and to consult with a professional if you have any doubts or concerns before attempting any repairs.
