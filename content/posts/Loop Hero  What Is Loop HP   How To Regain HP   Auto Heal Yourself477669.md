Loop Your Way to Victory: Discover the Secret to Regaining HP and Auto-Healing in Loop Hero!

Loop Hero has become one of the most popular strategic games among gamers in recent times. It is an entertaining and engaging game that requires a player to create a world through looping. From fighting monsters and surviving the harsh terrain, to building villages and taking on bosses, the game is full of challenges and surprises. In this article, we will look at a secret that can help you regain HP and auto-heal in Loop Hero.

First, let us understand the importance of HP (Health Points) in Loop Hero. Every time your character engages in battles, they take damage. The damage in turn reduces their HP, and when the HP reaches zero, the character dies, and you lose all your progress in that loop. Therefore, as a player, it is essential that you keep your HP high and restore it as necessary to succeed in the game.

One way to regain HP in Loop Hero is to place a Blood Grove card strategically. The Blood Grove card creates a pool of blood that heals nearby allied units by 20% of their max HP every loop. You can use this card to your advantage by placing it next to a town or village, where allied units come to rest. Once the allied units enter the pool of blood, they will start to heal automatically, and your character can keep fighting without worrying about losing HP.

Another great way to regain HP in Loop Hero is through the "Fast and Furious" trait. This trait increases your character's attack speed by 2%, and every time they land a hit on an enemy, their HP regeneration increases by 0.02% per second. This trait is useful when engaging multiple monsters at once, as it allows you to regain HP quickly while dealing significant damage.

Lastly, you can use the Necromancer card to your advantage to restore your HP automatically. The Necromancer card creates a skeleton every three seconds, which has a chance to restore 1.5% of your max HP. The card is useful in long battles against bosses or elite monsters, where you need to keep your HP high to defeat them.

In conclusion, regaining HP and auto-healing in Loop Hero is essential to your success in the game. We have shown you three secret ways that you can use to keep your character healthy and ready for battle. So, the next time you play Loop Hero, remember to use the Blood Grove, Fast and Furious trait, and Necromancer card to loop your way to victory.

But by using some specific Traits you can make sure to heal constantly. Traits are the passive abilities unlocked by beating bosses and can be obtained each time your character levels up. That is, each time you are level up, you will be presented with three traits to choose from. You may only select one from the three options. The choice will stay active with you for the entire duration of the run. Traits like Buckler, Residual Heat & Surveyor will heal you while exploring the loop. So to understand more about this, let us look at what is Loop HP in Loop Hero.
 
## What Is Loop Hp in Loop Hero?
 

 
Loop HP is the overall HP you have during each Loop cycle. There three different traits that help you to gain your lost HP during a run. They are:
 
- Buckler: Every counterattack restores 1.5×loop HP (Warrior Class only).
 - Residual Heat: Receive 3×loop HP after the skeleton’s death (Necromancer Class only).
 - Surveyor: +0.5×loop HP for an adjacent road-side tile while passing a tile (All Class applicable).

This will boost your HP vastly later in the game as your loop will have structures almost completely. Each time you pass through any of the tiles, you will keep accumulating HP.So the longer you run, the more the heal you gain. So make use to unlock Surveyor Trait and choose it when your hero levels up.
