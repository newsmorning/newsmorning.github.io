As an iPad 4 user, you may occasionally encounter battery issues. One of the most common issues is a misbehaving or inaccurate battery icon. This can be frustrating and lead to confusion about the actual battery life remaining on your device. In this article, we will discuss why this problem occurs and how to fix it.

## Why Does the Battery Icon Misbehave on iPad 4?

The battery icon on your iPad 4 may misbehave due to several issues, including:

### 1. Outdated iOS Software

If your iPad 4 is running an outdated iOS version, the battery icon may malfunction or show inaccurate readings. This happens because the software doesn't align with the iPad's actual battery usage and data.

To check if your iOS software version is outdated, go to "Settings"  > "General" > "Software Update." If there is a newer version available, download and install it.

### 2. Damaged Battery

If you have been using your iPad for an extended period, the battery may have become damaged or faulty, resulting in a misbehaving battery icon that doesn't show the accurate percentage of remaining battery life. A damaged battery can also get overheated, increasing the risk of exploding or igniting your device.

You can check your iPad's battery health by going to "Settings" > "Battery" > "Battery Health." If the maximum capacity is below 80%, it may be time to have the battery replaced at an authorized service center.

### 3. Defective Charging Cable or Power Adapter

Sometimes, the battery icon may misbehave because of a defective charging cable or power adapter. A cable that is frayed or damaged can cause electric current variations to the battery, eventually leading to inaccurate readings on the battery icon.

To rule out this possibility, try charging your iPad 4 with a different cable and adapter. If the battery icon readings become normal, you will need to replace your previous cables/adapters.

## How to Fix a Misbehaving Battery Icon on iPad 4

Now that you know why your battery icon may misbehave, it's time to troubleshoot and fix the problem. Here are some steps you can take to fix a misbehaving battery icon on your iPad 4:

### 1. Calibrate Your Battery

Calibrating your iPad's battery can help fix a misbehaving battery icon. It involves draining the battery and charging it to 100% again.

To calibrate your iPad 4's battery, follow these simple steps:
- Let your iPad's battery drain completely until it shuts down.
- Charge your iPad 4 until it reaches 100%.
- Keep your iPad 4 charging for another hour or two after it reaches 100%.

### 2. Restart Your iPad 4

Sometimes, restarting your iPad 4 can fix a misbehaving battery icon. To restart your iPad 4, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the red slider appears. Swipe the slider, and your iPad 4 will shut down. Then press the Sleep/Wake button again to turn it on.

### 3. Reset Your iPad 4

If your battery icon still misbehaves, resetting your iPad 4 may help. Go to "Settings" > "General" > "Reset" > "Erase All Content and Settings." Note that you will lose all the data stored on your iPad 4.

### 4. Seek Assistance from Apple Support

If none of the above steps work, you may need to seek professional help through Apple support. They can provide further guidance on how to fix your iPad 4's battery issues or replace it if necessary.

In conclusion, fixing a misbehaving battery icon on your iPad 4 doesn't have to be complicated. Try the above steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue. If all fails, seek professional help from Apple. Remember to always take care of your iPad 4's battery to ensure it lasts longer and operates optimally.

I got this one in with a battery icon I don't know.  The battery appears dead.  While in the charger I can press the power button and very quickly get a battery icon (on its side)  with what looks like three or four vertical red lines at the base of the battery.  Is this a dead battery or does the icon tell something else?

 @mayer if this is

the icon you get, then this is the icon you'll see if you plug your iPad into power, but the battery is to low for it to start. You can try and charge it for an hour or so and if everything works it should boot up. If not, then you either have issues with the charger (not the right one or not working), or you may have issues with the lightning connector. It would be unusual to display for a bad battery, but of course not impossible.
