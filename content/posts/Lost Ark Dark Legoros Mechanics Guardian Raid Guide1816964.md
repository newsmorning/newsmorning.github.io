# Unleash the Secrets of the Dark Legoros in Lost Ark's Most Insane Guardian Raid - Your Ultimate Guide Inside!

If you've played Lost Ark, you know that Guardian Raids are the ultimate challenges in the game. And if you're looking for the biggest of them all, look no further than Dark Legoros. This Guardian Raid is not for the faint of heart. With its complex mechanics and unforgiving difficulty, this challenge will push even the most skilled players to their limits.

In this article, we'll take a deep dive into Dark Legoros and uncover all its secrets. By the end, you'll be ready to take on this beastly boss and come out victorious.

# The Basics 

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of Dark Legoros, let's cover the basics. Dark Legoros is a Guardian Raid that unlocks at level 50. It requires a raid group of 20 players and has a recommended gear score of 2,500. It's located in the eastern part of the Avalon Peninsula, and can only be accessed by a daily quest which becomes available at level 50.

Once inside, you'll face the giant Dark Legoros. He has several phases, which we'll cover in detail below. But first, let's go over some tips to keep in mind before you start the fight.

# Tips for Success

1. Bring a balanced raid group with a mix of tanks, healers, and DPS. Communication is key to success, so make sure everyone's on the same page.

2. Coordinate your attacks carefully. Dark Legoros has several mechanics that require close coordination to be successful.

3. Use your consumables wisely. Make sure everyone has the right buffs and potions to endure through the boss fight.

4. Stay focused and never give up. Dark Legoros is a tough boss, but with patience and persistence, you can definitely take him down.

# Dark Legoros Phases

Now let's get into the meat of the Dark Legoros fight. In total, there are six phases to this boss -- each one progressively more difficult than the last. Here's what you need to know about each phase:

# Phase 1

In this phase, Dark Legoros will randomly select two players and give them a debuff called 'Darkness.' Players affected by Darkness must position themselves away from the rest of the raid. A few seconds later, Dark Legoros will release a pulse that deals damage to any players nearby. Players who are affected by Darkness will not take any damage, but will instead gain a stack of a debuff called 'Deep Sorrow.' If the stack reaches five or more, the player dies.

To avoid chaos, players must make sure they’re positioned properly and avoid getting too close to each other. The damage received can wipe out a group in one shot, so this is a crucial moment for players to work together and stay disciplined.


# Phase 2

In this phase, Dark Legoros will spawn a series of pools around the area. Each of these pools will deal massive damage to any player who stands on them. To complicate things further, the boss will also start summoning smaller creatures, which the raid must deal with while avoiding the dangerous pools. 

Players need to work fast and eliminate the creatures while avoiding the pools of slime. The faster the players move, the better their odds of keeping their health bars intact.


# Phase 3

In phase 3, Dark Legoros will target a random player and begin to spin. If any players are caught in the spin, they will be knocked back and receive significant damage. The player who caused the spin must change position on the boss and stand on a symbol that appears. Failure to do so will cause the spin to continue and potentially wipe out the raid.

Players must move quickly to break the spin and get to the symbol, dodging any damaging attacks from the boss. Timing and coordination are critical to surviving this phase.


# Phase 4

Dark Legoros will spit acid on the floor and create a small pool of toxic damage. The pool will grow larger and will inflict more damage to players if not dealt with. At the same time, the boss will start targeting players with a red circle appearing on the floor. This circle indicates that the player is about to take a hit from the boss's tail.

The goal during this phase is to dodge the toxic pool of acid and the boss's tail attacks while dealing enough damage to break through the armor. Keeping a keen eye on the boss's attacks and movements is crucial here.


# Phase 5

In phase 5, Dark Legoros will start shooting a salvo of projectiles from his back. Players can dodge by staying within the boss's shadow, but this will slow down their movement speed. The boss will also randomly target players with a red circle as in phase 4, but the projectiles make it harder to dodge everything.

Players need to watch the boss attacks carefully and get into the shadow quickly to avoid the incoming projectiles. Keeping tight coordination with the raid is crucial at this point in the fight.


# Phase 6

In the final phase, Dark Legoros will combine all of the mechanics from the previous five phases into one huge challenge. Players need to be on their toes as they fight to survive and deal massive damage. The boss will constantly switch targets and keep the players guessing, so communication is key to staying alive.


# Conclusion

Dark Legoros is the ultimate challenge in Lost Ark. It takes coordination, attention, and determination to take down this powerful Guardian Raid. But with the right strategy and the right team, you can emerge victorious. Use the tips and tricks in this guide to prepare yourself for the fight ahead, and don't forget to communicate and stay focused. Good luck!
