Have you ever heard of impaired assets? If you’re a business owner or an accountant, then you know what it means. But for those who don’t know, impaired assets refer to assets that have lost their value over time or have no market value. Impairment can happen due to a variety of factors, including economic changes, obsolescence, or incidents like natural disasters. The impact that impaired assets can have on your business can be quite significant. In this article, we will explore what impaired assets mean and how they can affect your business with shocking examples.\nWhat are Impaired Assets? Impaired assets are defined as assets that have seen a significant decline in value or no longer have any market value. These assets are classified as “impaired” when their carrying value or book value is more than their recoverable value. Carrying value is the cost of the asset minus depreciation, while the recoverable value is the amount of cash that the asset can generate if it is sold. When the carrying value is higher than the recoverable value, it means that the asset is impaired.\nHow Can Impaired Assets Affect Your Business? Impaired assets can signal a significant problem for your business. They can impact your financial statements and affect your business’s cash flow, profitability, and investor confidence. Here are some ways that impaired assets can hurt your business:\nReduced profitability: When an asset’s carrying value is higher than its recoverable value, it leads to a lower profit margin. This is because the asset isn’t generating enough money to cover the cost of its purchase.\nCash flow problems: If you have many impaired assets on your balance sheet, it can lead to cash flow problems. You might have to spend money to maintain the assets when they aren’t generating any income.\nReduced investor confidence: Impaired assets can be a sign of poor management, and this can impact investor confidence. Investors might be hesitant to invest in your business if they see a significant number of impaired assets on your balance sheet.\nShocking Examples of Impaired Assets Here are some real-life examples of impaired assets that had a significant impact on businesses:\nSears Holdings - In 2018, Sears filed for bankruptcy and listed impaired assets worth $2.2 billion. These assets included inventory, real estate, and intellectual property.\nGeneral Electric - In 2018, General Electric announced that it had $22 billion of impaired assets, mainly from its power business.\nCarillion - In 2018, the UK construction company Carillion went bankrupt, and it listed impaired assets worth £925 million. These assets included goodwill, contracts, and receivables.\nHow to Deal with Impaired Assets It’s essential to have a plan in place to deal with impaired assets. Here are some steps that you can take:\nAssess the impairment: The first step is to assess the impairment correctly. You will need to determine the cause and how much the asset’s value has declined.\nWrite down the asset: If the asset’s carrying value is higher than its recoverable value, you will need to write it down. This means reducing the asset’s value on your balance sheet.\nDispose of the asset: If the asset is no longer useful, it’s best to sell it or dispose of it.\nFocus on asset management: To avoid impaired assets, you should focus on asset management. This includes tracking the asset’s value over time and ensuring that it remains useful and profitable.\nConclusion Impaired assets are more common than you might think, and they can have a significant impact on your business. It’s crucial to assess, write down, and dispose of these assets to limit their impact on your financial statements. You should also focus on asset management to avoid future impairments. Understanding the concept of impaired assets is crucial for any business owner or accountant.\nImpaired Assets Definition Example of Impaired Assets Company A ltd purchased company B ltd and paid $ 19 million as the purchase price for buying company B ltd.
