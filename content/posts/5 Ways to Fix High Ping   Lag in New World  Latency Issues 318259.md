Say Goodbye to Lag in New World with These 5 Genius Fixes for High Ping and Latency Issues!

For avid gamers who enjoy playing in real-time, latency or lag can be frustrating and even ruin the gaming experience. New World, Amazon’s latest release, is no exception. However, with the right setup and understanding of the causes of high ping, you can kiss lag goodbye and have a seamless game.

Here are five genius fixes for high ping and latency issues in New World:

1. Optimize Your Network Settings

Have you ever tried to refresh a webpage and waited endlessly, only to discover there’s an issue with your wi-fi connection? Well, the same applies to online gaming. A few things can cause high latency, including network congestion, outdated firmware or drivers, or a poor connection to your server.

To eliminate these issues, consider optimizing your network settings. For starters, adjust your router’s quality of service (QoS) settings and prioritize gaming traffic over other activities like streaming or downloading. You may also need to upgrade your router or switch service providers for a faster, dedicated connection.

2. Use Ethernet Cables

If you’re still using Wi-Fi for gaming, you’re unlikely to get the best experience. Ethernet cables offer faster and more reliable speeds, preventing any delays or lag spikes that could ruin your gameplay.

Some tips for using Ethernet cables to eliminate lag in New World include minimizing the distance between your PC and modem, checking if your network card supports gigabit speeds, and using a quality Ethernet cable with minimal interference from other devices in your home.

3. Close Unnecessary Background Tasks

Another common cause of high ping and latency issues in New World is running too many tasks simultaneously on your computer. Unnecessary tasks and apps can use valuable system resources, hog your bandwidth, or cause your CPU to overheat, leading to lag or game crashes.

To prevent these issues, ensure that you close all background tasks, including your web browser and downloads, before gaming. Also, consider installing an antivirus program to eliminate malware that could slow down your PC.

4. Update Your Drivers, Operating System, and Game

Outdated drivers, software, and games can also cause high ping and latency issues in New World. Therefore, it’s essential to keep your drivers, operating system, and game updated to have a seamless gaming experience.

Check regularly for updates, particularly for your graphics card, sound card, and network adapter. Also, ensure that your operating system and game are up-to-date with the latest patches, bug fixes, and performance upgrades.

5. Test Your Ping and Adjust Your Game Settings

Lastly, to get rid of high ping and latency issues in New World, test your ping and adjust your game settings accordingly. You can use several online tools to test your connection speed and ping, allowing you to see if you have any issues.

Once you identify the problem, try adjusting your game settings to optimize performance, reduce graphics intensiveness, or increase FPS. You can also try playing in different servers to see if the issue resolves itself.

Conclusion

Lag, high ping, and latency issues should not ruin your gaming experience in New World. With these five genius fixes, you can have seamless gameplay, optimize your internet connection, and reduce any disruptions.

Remember to prioritize your gaming traffic, close unnecessary background tasks, use Ethernet cables, update your drivers and software, and test your ping frequently to stay ahead of any potential problems.
