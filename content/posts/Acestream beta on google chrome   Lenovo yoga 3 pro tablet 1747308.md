## Chosen Solution
 Hi, does anyone know what could be causing alarm streaming media player error too come up once acestream loads and buffers a stream? I have the latest update,, the acestream program is on google play and I'm running chrome? Everything seems fine until the stream has finished buffering. Please help

 Try to watch acestream channels on http://dvb-p.com without plug-in . On http://dvb-p.com the acestream links can be watched without plugin you just need the engine to be running in the background . Chrome doesn't need to use any plugin to play the video on www.dvb-p.com . The channels are working naively with HTML5 video .
