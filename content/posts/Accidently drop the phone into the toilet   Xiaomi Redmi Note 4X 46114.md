# Drop your Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X in the toilet? Here's what you should do next!

Dropping your Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X in the toilet is a terrifying experience. Not only is it expensive to replace, it also contains important data that you might lose forever. However, if this ever happens to you, there are a few steps you can take to minimize the damage and salvage your phone. Here are the things you should do next:

## 1. Turn off your phone immediately

This is a crucial step to prevent further damage to your phone. Water and electronics don't mix well, so the longer your phone is powered on, the more chances water has to seep deeper into the crevices and harm the internal components. If you dropped your phone in the toilet and it's still on, turn it off as quickly as possible. To do this, press and hold the power button until your phone shuts down completely.

## 2. Dry your phone with a cloth or towel

After you turn off your phone, a good first step is to dry it off with a cloth or towel. Make sure the towel or cloth is clean and absorbent. Don't use a hairdryer, microwave, or oven to dry your phone, as it can cause further damage to the internal components.

## 3. Remove the SIM card and memory card

If your phone has a SIM card and memory card, remove them immediately. SIM cards and memory cards are usually durable and can withstand some water damage. However, they'll need to be dried off separately to ensure they're not damaged.

## 4. Place your phone in a bowl of uncooked rice

The most effective way to dry your phone is to place it in a bowl of uncooked rice. Rice is an excellent desiccant, which means it can absorb moisture effectively. Place your phone in a bowl of uncooked rice and let it sit for at least 24-48 hours. Don't turn it on during this period, as water might still be present inside the phone.

## 5. Turn on your phone

After you've let your phone sit in a bowl of rice for at least 24 hours, try turning it on. If it powers on and works normally, congratulations! However, if it doesn't work, you might need to take it to a professional phone repair shop for further inspection.

## 6. Backup your data

If your phone did start normally after completing the above steps, it's important that you back up your data immediately. This way if your phone has suffered some internal damage, you still have your vital data saved elsewhere.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, dropping your Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X in the toilet does not have to be a disaster. By following the above steps, you can minimize the damage and salvage your phone. Remember to act quickly, turn off your phone, dry it off, remove the SIM card and memory card, place it in a bowl of rice, turn it on, and backup your data. If all else fails, don't hesitate to take your phone to a professional for further inspection.

 蔡小珍 treat this like you would treat any other water damaged device. The very first thing you want to do is to not try to restart/sync the phone. This may further damage your phone. The next thing to do is to clean it. Disassemble your phone using this video should help with that.  You must remove all the EMI shields of the logic board. If you do not remove those you are not cleaning 3/4 of the board.  Clean everything with +90% (no less than 90%) isopropyl alcohol. Follow this guide, and even so it was written for a 3G all the points are still pertinent to your phone. Pay particular attention to the SMD components, check for charred missing or broken missing. You can then dry the board in an oven or equivalent at 220deg F (not higher;-) for a few hours. Best way to clean it would of course be through an ultrasonic cleaner. Consider professional help with that  When it is properly cleaned,  replace the battery.  All these steps are to avoid delayed failure caused by corrosion. Once all this is done, reassemble your phone and reevaluate.

 The method is a good one, but corrosion on the motherboard will be easier to remove doing this:
Honestly, liquid damage can be a hit miss situation. The cheapest but an efficient way would be to grab Isopropyl alcohol (preferably 99%), and a tooth brush. Apply a small amount to the tooth brush a go around the areas affected, then let it evaporate for 10 minutes. Repeat this step at least 3 times. Before assembling, let it dry for around 20 minutes, and make sure any corrosion is gone.
