## Chosen Solution
 Hello, I recently moved my hard drive over from one Dell Inspiron 17-3721 to another. The first had motherboard failure but this one now has an issue with the DC power jack.  Does anyone know of a good repair guide and a good place to get the part?

 Hi @mannermauler ,
Here’s a link to the service manual for your laptop, taken from this webpage
Scroll to p.73 to view the necessary pre-requisite steps and then the procedure to remove the power adapter port. (Their name for the DC-In jack)
Replacements are available online, just search for Dell Inspiron 17-3721 power adapter port part to get results. Here’s a link to just one supplier of the part. It is shown only to give you an idea of the cost of the part and also the various Dell models that the part is compatible with.
Hopefully this is of some help.

 To start (if both laptops are identical) take a look at this video:

=====================================================
if they are not identical anyway the video will give you an idea of how to get to the jack.
if it is a cable it has a sticker with the model number.
if it is soldered you best shot is take it to a repair store.
