Introduction: As a Netflix user, you must have experienced the frustration of getting stuck on the 25% loading screen while trying to watch your favorite show or movie. This issue can occur due to various reasons such as slow internet connection, outdated browser, or outdated Netflix app. But don't worry, we have got you covered with the ultimate fix to get past this annoying issue.

Step-by-Step Guide:

Step 1: Check your internet connection - The first thing you need to do is check your internet connection. The loading issue can occur due to slow or unstable internet connection. You can try resetting your router, connecting to a different network, or contacting your internet service provider to resolve the issue.

Step 2: Update your browser - If you are using an outdated browser, then it can cause the loading issue. Make sure that you are using the latest version of your browser. You can also try clearing your browser cache and cookies to improve the performance.

Step 3: Clear your Netflix app cache - If you are using the Netflix app, then clearing the cache can help to resolve the loading issue. To clear the cache, go to the "Settings" menu on the app and select "Clear Cache". You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the app to resolve the issue.

Step 4: Disable extensions and ad-blockers - Browser extensions and ad-blockers can interfere with the Netflix playback and cause the loading issue. Try disabling any extensions or ad-blockers that you have installed on your browser and check if the issue is resolved.

Step 5: Change streaming quality - If the loading issue is due to slow internet connection, then changing the streaming quality can help to resolve the issue. You can change the streaming quality by going to the "Playback Settings" on your Netflix account and selecting a lower or higher streaming quality depending on your internet speed.

Conclusion:

The 25% loading issue on Netflix can be frustrating, but with these simple steps, you can easily resolve the issue and enjoy uninterrupted viewing of your favorite shows and movies.

Binging has gone to a whole different level during the COVID-19 pandemic, and streaming platforms have really become indispensable for some people.
 
However, don’t think that these platforms come without problems or bugs of their own, as that would be extremely farfetched.
 
In fact, we can help with most of the Netflix errors, such as Title not Available to Watch Instantly, or others. And, if ExpressVPN is not working with Netflix, we can help with that too.
 
However, a lot of Netflix users reported that the streaming platform keeps buffering endlessly, getting stuck at 25%. Today, we will show you how to deal with that.
 
## Why does my Netflix keep buffering and getting stuck at 25%?
 
You should know that there isn’t just one reason why Netflix users will often get this endless buffer problem while streaming.
 
In fact, this can occur due to :
 
- Bugs
 - Faulty/slow Internet speed
 - Outdated version of the Netflix app
 - Corrupted cache/cookies
 - The operating system might be outdated

 
Don’t worry, today we are going to look at why Netflix gets stuck at 15% while buffering and we will offer you some solutions to fix the problem.
 
#### Is it better to use the Netflix app or the web version?
 
For starters, the image resolution for Netflix on Google Chrome is limited to 720p, and Netflix will not offer higher resolutions unless the browser offers DRM capabilities that Chrome does not have. 
 
The only ways to get 1080p or 4K resolution on a Windows 10 system are to use the Edge browser (either the old one or the new Chromium-based version) or the app. 
 
Please keep in mind that 4K also has specific hardware requirements, so that is something to look into as well when demanding better image quality.
 
## How do I fix my Netflix buffering and getting stuck at 25%?
 
### 1. Restart your PC
 
Again, the problems that are annoying and frustrating and seem so hard to fix, only need a quick, short action to be eliminated.
 
In this case, when your Netflix keeps buffering continuously and becoming stuck at 25%, a PC restart (or power cycle the TV) will get you back on the right track.
 
You can also force-power cycle your PC, but we recommend starting with a simple system restart, before going further with this troubleshooting process.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

### 2. Relog into the Netflix app
 
If you are using the Netflix app instead of the browser, we also recommend logging out of the Netflix app completely, closing it, and then restarting it.
 
Enter your credentials again, if they are not saved, and connect to the Netflix streaming service again via the application.
 
Many users that were dealing with the same situation actually admitted that re-logging into the Netflix app eliminated the issue entirely.
 
### 3. Check your internet connection
 
Be sure to check your Internet connection when dealing with online streaming platforms, as everything depends on your Internet.

### 4. Update your Netflix app
 
- Open the Microsoft Store.
 - Search for the Netflix app.
 - Press the Update button if an update is available.

 
### 5. Clear the browser’s Cache & Cookies
 
- Click on the Customize and control Google Chrome button.
 - Select History, then click on History again.
 - Click on the Clear browsing data button.
 - Select Cookies and other site data and Cached images and files, then select All time and click on Clear data.

 
For an in-depth clean of all cookies and cached data, we recommend CCleaner, a tool specialized in removing unnecessary data. It will scan your PC and find all files and temporary data that needs to be deleted so the system will run better.
 
### How can I make Netflix run better on my PC?
 
The most important aspect is to always have a reliable internet connection, otherwise, the streaming platform will buffer annoyingly often.
 
Also if you don’t have a powerful rig, close some of the background processes that could hinder your streaming experience.
 
Furthermore, if you are using a VPN service but don’t require one for Netflix, turn it off while watching shows on Netflix.
 
And, just as you saw n the last solution of this guide, delete the cached images and files, as well as cookies and other site data on a regular basis.
