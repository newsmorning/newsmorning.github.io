Title: Is Your Acer Aspire E1 571 Refusing to Start? Find out Why!

Introduction:

Acer Aspire E1 571 is a popular notebook computer that has been in the market for quite some time. While it has proved to be a reliable device, it is not immune to occasional issues that can prevent it from starting up normally. If you are facing this problem, don't worry; there are several reasons why your Acer Aspire E1 571 may be refusing to start, and we will discuss them in this article.

Body:

1. Dead Battery

One common reason why your Acer Aspire E1 571 may not start up is a dead battery. If your battery is dead or discharged, your computer will not be able to turn on. To diagnose this problem, connect your laptop to a power source and check if your battery is charging. If not, you may need to replace the battery.

2. Power Adapter issue

Another possible reason for your Acer Aspire E1 571 not starting up could be a faulty power adapter. A defective adapter may not allow the laptop to receive the necessary power supply when turned on. Make sure your adapter is correctly plugged into a power source and the laptop.

3. Overheating

Overheating is another potential cause for your laptop not starting up. When overheated, the computer may shut down or refuse to turn on. Make sure your laptop's fan is working efficiently and prevent putting it on surfaces that retain heat.

4. Defective Screen

In rare situations, the Acer Aspire E1 571 may not start due to a defective screen. This may make it difficult to see anything on the laptop display, and so you may think that your computer is not starting up. If you suspect this, try connecting your laptop to an external monitor to verify if the problem is from your screen.

Conclusion:

When your Acer Aspire E1 571 is refusing to start, it can be frustrating, but it can be easily resolvable if you know the underlying causes. From a dead battery to defective screens, there can be several reasons why a laptop may not turn on. By identifying the issue, you can apply the necessary remedy and have your Acer Aspire E1 571 working in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I was working with laptop when I got other work , so I push my laptop in sleep mode and forgot. After a week when I try to switch it on again...
1) it shows in power led on.
2) if charger plugin then shows charging led on.
Problem is it shows only these two led ON and nothing else happens
-no Acer logo on screen
- no processor led is on means I guess hard disk didn't start
I tried to methods suggested in other similar questions asked like remove charger and battery, but didn't work.. Plz help...

 I turn my computer off and unplugged it. Then I turn it back on and the Acer logo is the only thing that comes on nothing else happens
