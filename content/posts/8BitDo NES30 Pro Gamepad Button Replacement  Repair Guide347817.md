You may want to replace old buttons with a new set as they wear out over time, or maybe you just want to give your controller’s existing buttons a new paint job.
 
This guide may also be useful if the L and R buttons on the shoulders of the controllers become jammed, meaning they become permanently pressed down. Although the shoulder buttons aren’t removable, you can follow the disassembly process of this guide through Step 3 to access the shoulder buttons and pop them back to their original position.
