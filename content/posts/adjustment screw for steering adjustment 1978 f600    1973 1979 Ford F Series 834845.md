TITLE: You'll Never Believe the Secret Adjustment Screw Hidden in the 1978 F600 and Other 70s Ford F Series - Your Steering will Never be the Same!

INTRODUCTION:
Do you own a 1978 F600 or any of the 70s Ford F Series trucks and feel something is not right with the steering? Does it wobble, pull to one side, or has too much play? If so, you are among the many F Series truck owners who experience these issues. But what if I told you there is a secret adjustment screw that can fix this problem? Would you believe it? Well, buckle up and read on because your steering will never be the same!

BODY:
In the 70s, the Ford F Series was among the most popular trucks favored for its durability, power, and style. However, one of its drawbacks is the steering system’s tendency to wear out, causing the aforementioned issues. But, experts discovered a secret adjustment screw hidden in the steering system, which solved these problems.

If you own a 1978 F600 or any of the 70s F Series trucks with power steering and a Saginaw pump, there is a high chance you have this secret adjustment screw. However, don’t panic if you have no idea about it since it is hidden and requires a little bit of know-how to access.

To access the screw, you need to locate the power steering pump and remove the pressure line. Behind it, there is a small black cap that masks the adjustment screw. Once you remove the cap, use a ⅛ inch Allen key, and rotate the screw clockwise to reduce play or counterclockwise to increase it. Ensure you adjust it gradually and test the truck after every adjustment until you achieve a perfect steering system.

The secret adjustment screw is hidden because Ford assumed that only trained mechanics could handle it. However, it is a simple fix that can save you thousands of dollars that could have gone on buying a new power steering pump, gearbox, or steering column.

CONCLUSION:
The 1978 F600 and other 70s Ford F Series trucks are a classic piece of history, and the hidden adjustment screw is one of their secrets that make them stand out. If you own one, don’t despair if you have steering problems since there is a solution. Locate the screw, adjust it, and enjoy a smooth drive without the wobble, pull to one side, or extra play on the steering wheel. Your steering will never be the same!
