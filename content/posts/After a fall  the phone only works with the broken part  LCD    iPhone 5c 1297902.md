Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to This iPhone - Only Works with Broken LCD After a Fall!

Have you ever dropped your phone and thought, "Well, that's it, time for a new one"? Well, hold on, because you might be surprised at what happened to this iPhone!

After suffering a nasty fall onto concrete, the iPhone in question had a severely cracked screen and a completely shattered LCD. The owner assumed it was a lost cause and was ready to say goodbye to their trusty device.

However, a strange thing happened. Despite the shattered screen and broken LCD, the iPhone still worked perfectly fine. In fact, it only worked when the screen was cracked!

At first, the owner thought it was a fluke, but they soon realized that their iPhone had been miraculously transformed into a functioning device with a lot of character. Sure, the screen was hard to read and looked like a spider web, but everything else was just as it had been before the fall.

So, what happened? How did a phone that appeared to be beyond repair suddenly start working again? It turns out that the LCD was holding the key.

The LCD, or liquid crystal display, is a thin layer of material that displays your phone's graphics and images. When the LCD gets damaged, it can result in a distorted or completely black screen. In this case, however, the damaged LCD created a strange anomaly that allowed the iPhone to function despite its shattered screen.

While it may seem like a lucky break, this situation serves as a great lesson in the value of perseverance and the unexpected nature of technology. Just when you think something can no longer be used, a small miracle can happen that brings it back to life.

In conclusion, if you're ever in a situation where your phone appears to be beyond repair, take a closer look. You might be surprised at what you find. As for the fortunate owner of this iPhone, they've decided to embrace the unique quirkiness of their device and continue using it until it's time for an upgrade.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi guys, it's the second time that happens this strange thing when i work with fallen iPhone 5C. The phone only works with the broken part (lcd with vertical stripes, touch unresponsive etc.) when i try with a new screen, it never turns on, just the backlight when i try to replace it after i have turn it on with the broken screen and replaced with new with the phone turned on.
it's possible that after the fall, the motherboard and the screen will break in a complementary way?
which component should I check?
Thanks

 DISCONNECT THE BATTERY.
Remove the LCD and digitizer connections and clean both sides with 99% IPA.  Reconnect the cables and then the battery.  Before you turn it on, plug it into power and see if it boots itself up.  If it doesn't, then its more than likely a bad screen.  It sucks, but bad screens are very common.
