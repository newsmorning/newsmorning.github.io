# Beware! Liftmaster Garage Door Remote Malfunction- Door Stays Up Without Warning!

If you own a Liftmaster garage door opener, it's important to be aware of a potential safety hazard that could arise unexpectedly. In some cases, the remote control could malfunction and cause the door to stay up without any warning, leaving your home and valuables exposed to potential theft or damage.

Liftmaster is a well-known and respected brand in the garage door industry, and their products are widely used in homes across the country. However, like any electronic device, they are not immune to malfunctions or defects that could cause serious safety issues.

The problem typically occurs when the remote control that operates the garage door opener fails to communicate properly with the main unit. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including interference from nearby appliances or devices, simple wear and tear on the remote control, or internal damage within the opener itself. Whatever the cause, the end result is the same – the door simply stays up, leaving your home unprotected.

So how can you avoid this potential safety hazard? The first step is to be aware of the signs that your Liftmaster garage door opener may be experiencing difficulties. If you notice that the door is not responding as quickly or smoothly as it used to, or if you experience any delays or irregularities when using the remote control, it's important to take action right away.

One way to address the problem is to have your garage door opener inspected by a qualified professional. An experienced technician can diagnose any issues with the unit and recommend appropriate repairs or replacements if necessary. In some cases, a simple adjustment or cleaning of the remote control is all it takes to ensure that your garage door opener is operating safely and effectively.

Another way to avoid potential problems with your Liftmaster garage door opener is to stay up-to-date with the latest product information and news. By staying informed about any recalls, defects, or other issues that may arise with your particular model, you can take proactive steps to address the issue and keep your home and family safe from harm.

In conclusion, it's essential to be aware of potential safety hazards associated with Liftmaster garage door openers, particularly when it comes to remote control malfunction. By staying informed, taking action when necessary, and working with qualified professionals, you can ensure that your garage door opener is operating safely and reliably at all times. So don't take chances when it comes to home security – be alert, be proactive, and stay safe!

## Chosen Solution
 I push remote and garage door goes down but then it goes back up. I adjust sensors that works for a few days then it starts doing the same thing.Is this bad sensors or there something else going on?

 Change the circuit board in the opener.
Disconnect all power to the opener before installing new board!!!
