This issue occurs when one or more players in a party are unable to see their fellow party members, leading to miscommunication and inconvenience during gameplays. Luckily, there is a simple fix to remedy this irritating issue, and gaming will be a lot more enjoyable after this.

If you are experiencing the dreaded "Can't See Party Members" issue in Lost Ark, the first step to solving it is to ensure that your graphics settings are in order. Open the game settings, and ensure that the graphics settings are not set too low as this might prevent the game from rendering all players in the party.

Another thing you can do is to check your internet connectivity. Sometimes, the problem may be with your internet connectivity, leading to packet loss or server disconnection. Try resetting your internet modem, router, and computer if you notice any internet issues. Also, check if your firewall or antivirus software is blocking the game from receiving proper network traffic. Ensure that your firewall or antivirus software is not blocking the game client from accessing the internet.

If the above solutions do not solve the problem, then you might need to update your graphics card drivers. Updating your graphics card driver will ensure that the game client can render all the players in the party. Additionally, you should ensure that you have updated the game client to the latest version. If the game client is outdated, you may experience compatibility issues with your operating system, leading to issues like Can't See Party Members.

Finally, if none of the above solutions work, you might want to try using a VPN. Sometimes, players' location and server location may affect the connections, leading to Can't See Party Members. Using a VPN will help you connect to nearby servers, ensuring that your connection remains stable, and you can see all the party members.

In conclusion, the "Can't See Party Members" issue in Lost Ark is frustrating and can ruin your gaming experience.
