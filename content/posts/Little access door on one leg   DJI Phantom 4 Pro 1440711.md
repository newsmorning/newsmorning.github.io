## Chosen Solution
 I accidentally ran into a tree branch in the yard and it made the phantom 4 stop and it fell about 6 feet. One of the propellers were  broken but I replaced that. A little access door on one of the legs popped off and it is not wanting to snap back on. I have tried but get to the point where I am afraid to force any more for fear of breaking it. Any suggestions?

 Be sure the landing gear isn't broken at the leg where the screw cover came off.  Sounds like the leg may be bent a little which is causing the cover to not fit properly.  It should snap in after inserting the prongs into the bottom of the opening (with the drone right side up - top of the opening if it's upside down).
