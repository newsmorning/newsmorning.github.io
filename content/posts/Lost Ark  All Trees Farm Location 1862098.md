## Where to Farm Trees in Lost Ark
 

 
Whilst the game has many trees, not all of them will be useful for you. So before you head to farm trees, it is important that you plan out the kind of trees that you want. These will help you avoid spending time on unnecessary items. Here are the best locations to farm Trees in Lost Ark:
 
- Giant Mushroom Islands – This area holds numerous types of trees that you can farm. While they are available in huge quantities, the drawback is you will need a ship to reach the island. Additionally, your Lumberjack trade skill level needs to be 10 or above to have access to most trees in the area.
 - Panda Island – Panda Island would be a like-to-like replacement for the Giant Mushroom Islands. You will need a ship and along with that, the Lumberjack trade skill level needs to be 10 or above.
 - Platinum Fields – While this is not exactly a source like the other two, it will still allow you to farm trees without losing energy. Timber is an important resource in Lost Ark and platinum fields are a great place to farm it. Provided, you have an entrance ticket for the Platinum Field.
 - Bilbrin Forest – Last but not least, Bilbrin Forest is one of the best locations to farm for trees. It offers variety and as an additional bonus, you won’t need a ship or a ticket to get there. Although, even if the name suggests, you cannot farm Bilbrin Wood here.
