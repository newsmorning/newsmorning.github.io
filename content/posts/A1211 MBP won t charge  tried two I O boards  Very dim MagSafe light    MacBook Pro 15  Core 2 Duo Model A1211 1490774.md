Title: Is Your Macbook Pro 15 Core 2 Duo Model A1211 Refusing to Charge? We Tried Two Solutions and the Magsafe Light is Very Dim - Find Out How to Fix It Now!


Introduction:

As a Macbook Pro user, you might have faced the frustrating issue of your laptop not charging. It is a common problem for most Macbook Pro 15 Core 2 Duo Model A1211 users, and one that can be solved easily if approached correctly. To help you fix this problem, we tried two solutions that worked. Read on to find out how to get your laptop charging again in no time!

Solution 1: Reset your System Management Controller (SMC)

One reason why your Macbook Pro 15 Core 2 Duo Model A1211 might not be charging is due to a problem with the SMC. The SMC is responsible for managing several vital functions of your Macbook, including battery management, thermal management, and more. When it fails, it can lead to several issues, which include causing your Macbook not to charge.

To fix this, you need to reset your SMC. Here are the steps to follow:

Step 1: Shut down your Macbook Pro 15 Core 2 Duo Model A1211.

Step 2: Connect your laptop to its MagSafe power adapter.

Step 3: Press the left SHIFT + CONTROL + OPTION keys, combined with the power button for a few seconds.

Step 4: Release all the keys and turn on your laptop.

The SMC should now be reset, and your Macbook should begin charging again. If this method does not work, you can try the next solution.

Solution 2: Check and clean the MagSafe connector

Sometimes, the MagSafe power adapters can get dirty and covered with dust and debris, causing them to malfunction. This leads to your laptop not charging or the Magsafe light being very dim.

Here is how you can clean your MagSafe connector:

Step 1: Disconnect your MagSafe connector from the power outlet and your laptop.

Step 2: Use a clean toothbrush to scrub the Magsafe connector, clearing any debris or dust. If necessary, use a can of compressed air to remove built-up dust from the connector.

Step 3: Once you’ve cleaned the connector, reconnect it to your laptop and power outlet and check if your laptop is charging correctly.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, if your Macbook Pro 15 Core 2 Duo Model A1211 is refusing to charge, don’t worry! The two solutions outlined above are tried and tested and will help you get your laptop charging again. If the issue persists, it could be a battery or hardware problem, and you should seek professional help. But in most cases, resetting your SMC or cleaning your MagSafe connector will get your Macbook Pro 15 back up and running.

## Chosen Solution
 I have decided to try and resurrect my old MacBook Pro because pandemic and boredom. 
In late 2012 the MagSafe port stopped charging the computer, but it would still happily run off a charged battery. When plugged in, the MagSafe light would cycle between green and orange, but would never charge the battery. I also recall that none of the left I/O ports worked properly, but could be mistaken. 
Based on my recollections, and the still blinking MagSafe light when I pulled out the old Mac, I ordered a replacement left I/O board from ifixit.  I have been unable to find a way to charge my battery to determine if the machine would still run on battery power, but assume the battery is totally shot after 6+ years on a shelf anyway. 
After installing the new board, I saw no light on the MagSafe charger. I swapped back in my old board, and got blinking lights. I swapped in the new one again, hoping I had just installed it improperly. Still dead light. 
I have swapped boards multiple times since, now getting the no light situation on both boards. It turns out this “no light” is actually a dim light, and the new board has a steady dim light while the old one blinks bright briefly sometimes. 
I am going to keep looking for a way to charge my battery, and will check for continuity in the power wires from the I/O board to the logic board and the battery connectors, as I somewhat suspect a fault in these wires or their connectors, but think it’s a long shot at this point. 
In the meantime, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for other parts I might need, or other things to check? I fully believe that this Mac still works if I can get power to it, but that’s proving to be a lot more challenging than I hoped! 
Also, anyone think replacing the I/O board was not needed? Maybe I had another issue from the start? 
and what might have caused the MagSafe light to go from blinking green then orange to very dim with very brief green flashes? 
any help would be appreciated, thanks!

 After sleeping on it, I went back today and realized I must have left the hard drive unplugged. The new I/O board works fine. Still haven't got the machine to fully boot (stays on the startup apple logo screen forever), but my charging issues are solved!!
Two lessons/solutions to remember:
1) go to bed and come back in the morning
2) Always plug in a hard drive! Why does that affect charging? I don't know, but it definitely does!
