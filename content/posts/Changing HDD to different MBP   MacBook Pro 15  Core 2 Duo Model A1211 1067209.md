## Chosen Solution
 My A1211 MBP logic board is broken, it currently runs on Boot Camp.
My question is what if I move my HDD to a different MBP A1211. Will it recognize the HDD normally with Boot Camp or do I need to do a fresh install?

 Swapping the drives should be an issue Windows will still work within Boot Camp. You will need to transfer the license over to the new system and some apps which latch onto the CPU’s ID may encounter problems.
