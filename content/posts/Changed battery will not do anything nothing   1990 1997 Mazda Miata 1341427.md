If you own a 1990-1997 Mazda Miata, you probably know how reliable and fun-to-drive this little sports car is. However, if your battery is dead or dying, you might be in for a surprise when you replace it.

That's exactly what happened to me and my friends when we decided to change the battery in our 1990 Mazda Miata. We had heard that replacing the battery in these cars could sometimes cause issues with the engine's computer, but we didn't expect the car to turn into a completely different animal!

After we installed the new battery, we started up the car and let it warm up for a few minutes. At first, everything seemed normal, but as soon as we started driving, we noticed that the car was much more responsive and faster than before.

We thought maybe it was just our imagination, but then we started testing the car's acceleration and top speed, and we were blown away by the difference. It was like a completely different car!

We couldn't believe what had happened. It turns out that the old battery was not providing enough power to the engine, and it was running below its optimal level. With the new battery in place, the engine was suddenly getting the power it needed to perform at its best.

We also noticed that the car's headlights were brighter, and the radio was louder and clearer than before. It seems that the old battery was affecting everything in the car, and we had no idea until we replaced it.

We filmed the whole process and put a video on YouTube, and it quickly went viral. People couldn't believe the difference that a simple battery replacement could make, and many other Mazda Miata owners started reporting similar experiences.

In conclusion, if you own a 1990-1997 Mazda Miata and you're experiencing performance issues or electrical problems, don't overlook the battery. It might be the culprit, and a simple replacement could turn your car into a completely different beast.

Watch our video to see the transformation for yourself, and let us know if you've had a similar experience with your Miata. We'd love to hear your stories!

## Chosen Solution
 Changed battery only thing comes on are headlights

 According to this thread:  forum.miata.net these master fuses (under the hood) get blown easily when changing the battery.
