Check Out These Amazing Linux Alternatives to Your Favorite Windows Apps - Part 2!\nAre you tired of paying for expensive software on Windows? Do you want to try something new and free? Linux may be the answer you are looking for! In this second part of our series, we will introduce you to some awesome Linux alternatives to your favorite Windows apps.\nGIMP instead of Adobe Photoshop GIMP is a free and open-source image manipulation program that is an excellent alternative to Adobe Photoshop. It has a similar set of tools and features as Photoshop and has been used by professional designers and artists. GIMP supports a wide range of file formats, including PSD files, which means you can open and edit your PSD files in GIMP.\nInkscape instead of Adobe Illustrator Inkscape is a free and open-source vector graphics editor that is an excellent alternative to Adobe Illustrator. It can be used for creating logos, icons, illustrations, and other graphics. Inkscape supports a wide range of vector graphics file formats, including SVG, AI, and PDF.\nKrita instead of Corel Painter Krita is a free and open-source digital painting program that is an excellent alternative to Corel Painter. It is used by digital artists and is designed for creating concept art, comics, and illustrations. Krita has a wide range of brushes, textures, and tools, making it an excellent choice for artists.\nLibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office LibreOffice is a free and open-source office suite that is an excellent alternative to Microsoft Office. It includes a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, and database applications. LibreOffice supports a wide range of file formats, including Microsoft Office, which means you can open and edit your Microsoft Office files in LibreOffice.\nBlender instead of Autodesk Maya Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation program that is an excellent alternative to Autodesk Maya. It can be used for creating 3D models, animations, and games. Blender has a wide range of features, including advanced modeling tools, texturing, animation, and physics simulation.\nAudacity instead of Adobe Audition Audacity is a free and open-source audio editing program that is an excellent alternative to Adobe Audition. It can be used for recording and editing audio files, including music and podcast recordings. Audacity has a wide range of features, including support for multiple tracks, noise reduction, and audio effects.\nIn conclusion, Linux provides an excellent alternative to expensive software on Windows. These Linux alternatives are free, open-source, and provide the same functionality as their paid counterparts. So what are you waiting for? Try them out today and save some money!\nIn part 1 of this series, I provided a list of open source alternatives useful for home office use, such as office suites and finance managers. As for part 2, what follows is just a taste of the many Linux applications available for editing, viewing, and streaming multimedia.\nImage Editors The Adobe suite of applications is not available for Linux. However, alternatives to Photoshop include the very popular GIMP and Krita, the most mature application in the Calligra Suite. Pinta and MyPaint are two simpler options that may be easier for new users to dive into. Inkscape is an alternative to Adobe Illustrator that allows you to create high quality SVG files.\nPhoto Managers Are you a fan of Picasa? Google used to release version of Picasa for Linux. While that is no longer the case, there are still many Linux photo management applications to choose from. KDE desktops tend to ship with Gwenview by default. DigiKam is a more fully featured photo manager geared more towards professional photographers. GNOME users may be familiar with either Shotwell or F-Spot.\nSound Editors Windows comes with a basic audio recording tool called Sound Recorder. If you need an alternative, GNOME produces an application by the same name. If your needs are heavier, Audacity is a popular cross-platform open source tool that allows you to record, edit, and convert audio files. This tool is versatile enough to make podcasts with, but if you still need more juice, then give Ardour a download. If you just need to convert multimedia files, then consider giving Sound Converteror soundKonverter a spin, depending on your desktop environment of choice.\nMusic Players Linux is overflowing with choices in this category. Rhythmbox provides a streamlined, basic iTunes type experience with a variety of plugins available. Banshee is an alternative that is also rich with options. Smaller music players include Audacious, Decibel, and Quod Libet.\nOn the KDE side of things, JuK is the default basic option, whereas Amarok is a feature rich and highly configurable alternative.\nPodcast Managers Linux has no shortage of suitable podcast managers. Miro pitches itself as a music and video player, and it allows you to take in podcasts without realizing that is what you are doing. If you prefer something else, Ruji has came out with 5 alternatives podcast client in Linux where you can choose and pick from.\nVideo Editors Linux does not yet have video editors that fully compete with Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. As for competing with Windows Movie Maker, Linux is on a much stronger ground. Kdenlive is a popular video editor with many advanced features. Pitivi and OpenShot provide more basic solutions for users with simpler needs. Hoping to make a feature film someday? Lightworks is a substantially more powerful option that is currently being ported over to Linux.\nVideo Players GNOME’s default video player is Totem. KDE’s default player is Dragon Player. The best known alternative is the VLC media player, which is prominent enough that millions of Windows and Mac OS X users also turn to VLC for their video playing needs. VLC can play virtually any multimedia format you throw at it. Lastly, we won’t forget SMPlayer, which is as capable as VLC.\nConclusion Your experience transitioning to Linux depends largely on your frame of mind going into it. If you expect to run the same applications, you should probably stick with the operating system you are already comfortable with. However, if you are open to learning new applications that perform the same tasks, transitioning should be just fine. If you don’t want to change your operating system, but you also don’t want to invest money in expensive software, many of these programs are also available for Windows or Mac. There is a wealth of information available online for making your switch as painless as possible.\nIf you have any open source alternatives you would like to recommend, let us hear about them in the comments below.\nBertel is a tech blogger and independent novelist who puts perhaps a tad too much trust in Google.
