If you're a car owner, you probably know that a car battery needs to be replaced periodically. It's an essential part of car maintenance that is often neglected. However, if you've recently changed the battery in your 2013 Nissan Pathfinder, you may have encountered a problem that you didn't expect: the driver's side window won't roll down, and the door won't lock. What could have caused this issue? In this article, we will explore the possible reasons behind this problem and what you can do to fix it.

First, let's discuss why the battery replacement could cause this problem. Your car's electrical system controls many of its functions, including the power windows and locks. When you replace the battery, the settings in the electrical system can be reset, which could cause certain components to malfunction. In some cases, this could be a simple fix, such as resetting the power window switch or reprogramming the door locks.

However, in some cases, the problem may be more complicated. For example, the power window motor or regulator may have failed. The power window motor is responsible for moving the window up and down, while the regulator controls the cable that moves the window. If either of these components fails, it can cause the window to get stuck in the up or down position, or not move at all. Similarly, the power lock actuator may have failed, preventing the door from locking or unlocking properly.

Another possible cause of this problem is a blown fuse. If the fuse that controls the power windows or locks has blown, these components will not function correctly. This is a relatively easy fix, as you can replace the blown fuse with a new one.

So, what should you do if you are experiencing this problem? First, check to see if it's a simple fix, such as resetting the power window switch or reprogramming the door locks. If that does not work, take your car to a mechanic or dealership to have it inspected. They will be able to diagnose the problem and provide you with a solution.

In conclusion, changing the battery in your 2013 Nissan Pathfinder can cause unexpected problems, such as the driver's side window not working and the door not locking. However, this issue can be caused by several factors, including resetting the electrical system, power window or lock component failure, or a blown fuse. If you're experiencing this problem, try resetting the system first, and if that doesn't work, take the car to a mechanic for a diagnosis. With proper care and maintenance, your car will continue to serve you well for many years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 Door locks and window on driver's side don't work after I cleaned my battery post

 I doubt it had anything to do with you changing the battery. You need to check the fuses. There is a fuse box under the hood and one inside the car. If those are good I would check and verify that you have no  power to the switches. If not and the fuses or breakers are ok I would verify that you have power before the the door. You wire loom on the door hinge can be pinched and break a wire. You will have to test these with a volt meter or test light. And it doesn't matter how the white looks like on the outside it can be broken inside.
