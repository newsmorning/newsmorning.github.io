# Shocking Discovery: Logitech K750 Keyboard Won't Turn On Even After Replacing Battery - What's Going On?!

If you're a fan of the sleek and stylish Logitech K750 keyboard, you may have run into a perplexing issue recently. You've replaced the battery, but the keyboard still won't turn on. What's going on? Is this a common problem, or is something more concerning at play? Let's take a closer look.

First, it's worth noting that the Logitech K750 keyboard has a reputation for being notoriously finicky when it comes to battery life. Some users report that the battery can last for months, while others say that it drains in a matter of days. This may be due to a variety of factors, including usage patterns and environmental conditions.

However, even if your keyboard has been performing well up to this point, it's not uncommon for the battery to suddenly stop working altogether. This can be frustrating, to say the least. But before you give up on your trusty Logitech keyboard, there are a few things you can try to troubleshoot the problem.

First, make sure that you're using the correct type of battery. The Logitech K750 requires a specific type of rechargeable battery - an ML2032 coin battery, to be exact. If you've swapped in a different type of battery, even one that's the same size, it may not work properly.

If you've confirmed that you're using the right battery, the next step is to make sure that it's installed correctly. Check to see if the battery contacts are clean and free of debris or corrosion. If there's any buildup on the contacts, gently clean them with a soft cloth or cotton swab.

If the battery and battery contacts look okay, it's time to try resetting the keyboard. To do this, unplug the keyboard's USB receiver from your computer (if it's connected) and turn the keyboard over. Look for the small connect button on the underside of the keyboard, usually located near the battery compartment. Use a paperclip or small tool to press it down for a few seconds. This should reset the keyboard's connection to its receiver.

If none of these steps work, it may be time to reach out to Logitech support for further assistance. They may be able to suggest additional troubleshooting steps, or they may recommend that you send the keyboard in for repairs.

While it can be frustrating when your Logitech K750 keyboard won't turn on even after replacing the battery, it's usually not a sign of a major problem. With a bit of patience and persistence, you can often get your keyboard up and running again in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I have bought and replaced the battery with an Maxell ML2032, but the keyboard doesn't show any signs of life. There is no green or red LED in the top right corner and the keyboard is not found by the unifying software. Each of the solar panels gives about 1.5v output when tested with voltmeter and the battery itself gives just over 2.8v (the old battery has less charge and gives about 1.2v).
Is there anything else that I might be able to do to fix the keyboard, I don't want to have to replace it?
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
Scott.

 You could have a look at the power (On Off) switch. On my K750, this switch is starting to fail causing symptoms like you describe.

 Turn the battery over. With the keyboard right side up you should see the smaller negative side up.

 Hi Scott, my guess would be that the logic board may need to be replaced OR a cable could have come dis-connected from the board or the battery itself. I suggest trying to re-install the new battery.
