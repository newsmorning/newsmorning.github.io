Title: Shocking Truth Revealed: Dell Laptop AC Adapter Makes Mysterious Buzzing Noise - Find Out Why!

Introduction:
If you are a Dell laptop owner, you may have encountered a sudden occurrence of a mysterious buzzing noise coming from your laptop AC adapter. You may have wondered what could be causing this noise and whether it is harmful to your laptop or you. This article reveals the shocking truth behind the mysterious buzzing noise from your Dell laptop AC adapter and why it is happening.

Section 1: The Cause of the Buzzing Noise
The buzzing noise from your Dell laptop AC adapter is caused by a phenomenon known as coil whine. Coil whine is a high-pitched noise that occurs when electrical components vibrate at a high frequency. In the case of Dell laptop AC adapter, the noise is caused by the transformer and other components that convert the AC power from the wall outlet to DC power for your laptop.

Section 2: Is it Harmful?
Fortunately, the buzzing noise from your Dell laptop AC adapter is not harmful to both you and your laptop. Although the noise can be annoying and distracting, it is a normal occurrence and does not indicate any defects or malfunctioning of your laptop. However, if the noise is too loud, you can consider replacing your AC adapter with a new one.

Section 3: Tips to Reduce the Noise
If you are experiencing a loud buzzing noise from your Dell laptop AC adapter, here are some tips to help reduce the noise.

1. Switch to a different power outlet - Sometimes, the buzzing noise might be caused by the wiring in the outlet. Therefore, try plugging your AC adapter into another outlet to see if the noise persists.

2. Use a surge protector - Using a surge protector can help protect both your laptop and the AC adapter from voltage fluctuations that can cause coil whine.

3. Replace your AC adapter - If the buzzing noise is too loud and irritating, you may consider replacing your AC adapter with a newer model. However, ensure that the new adapter is compatible with your laptop model.

Conclusion:
The buzzing noise from your Dell laptop AC adapter is a normal occurrence caused by coil whine. It is not harmful to both you and your laptop and does not indicate any defects or malfunctioning. However, if the noise is too loud and irritating, you can consider using the tips mentioned above to help reduce it.

## Chosen Solution
 i bought a dell inspiron n5110 laptop yesterday. i can hear buzzing noise from ac adapter brick when its plugged to the laptop, i can hear it of 20cm distance, and when i disconnect it, the noise reduces.
is it normal? or i should replace it?

 The buzzing noise that you are hearing is normal to that point that you should be able to hear it when the brick is next to your ear. If you are about a foot away from the ac adapter and you can still hear it then it is nearing end of life or already faulty.
Without a load on the device the hum should lessen due to circuits that reduce power output that allow the ac adapter to "idle" while waiting to be plugged in and will also allow the brick to cool down. Once plugged in the output circuit is activated and the louder hum will return as well as the ac adapter becoming warm up again.
If you are interested the rectifier circuit in the ac adapter will filter half of the ac adapter wave and then a voltage regulator will clip the top wave to generate an even source of DC power. Using these circuits in such close proximity of the magnetic field of a transformer can contribute to a high pitched hum from the device that is not very loud and is typically dampened by the casing for the device. As parts in the circuit degrade they can become more susceptible to the magnetism and heat strains that are put on them which can result in small fluctuations in power and voltage provided as well as a louder hum. There is nothing you can do about this degradation as the longevity and hum from the device is dependent on the design of the device, the quality of the parts used, and how well the heat generated is dealt with.

 my Dell laptop charger is making noise like krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr   continuously.
is it ok or I need to replace it

 old charger, use a genuine replacement, the aftermarket ones are dodgy as.
