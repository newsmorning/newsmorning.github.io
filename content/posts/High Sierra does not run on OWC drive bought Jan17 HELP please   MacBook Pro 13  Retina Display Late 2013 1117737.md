You Won't Believe Why High Sierra Won't Run on This Popular OWC Drive - MacBook Pro Owners, Beware!

If you are a MacBook Pro owner, you already know how important it is to keep your operating system updated to ensure your device is protected against security threats and to take advantage of the latest features. However, if you have an OWC drive and planned to upgrade to High Sierra, you may be in for a surprise.

Many MacBook Pro users are reporting that High Sierra will not run on their OWC drive, leaving them without access to the latest operating system. But why is this happening?

The issue stems from the fact that some OWC drives use a third-party driver that is not compatible with High Sierra. Specifically, the driver in question is the "SoftRAID Lite XT" driver, which is included with some OWC drives for RAID functionality.

Apple's latest operating system, High Sierra, has updated its file system to the new Apple File System (APFS). While this new file system offers a more secure and efficient way to manage data, it also requires updated driver software to ensure it works correctly.

Unfortunately, SoftRAID Lite XT has not been updated to work with High Sierra's APFS file system, rendering the OWC drive useless for many MacBook Pro owners.

For those affected, it's a frustrating situation. Many users have relied on their OWC drives for years and are now faced with the prospect of buying a new drive to upgrade to High Sierra.

Thankfully, OWC has recognized this issue and is actively working on a solution. The company has released a beta test of a new SoftRAID driver that will work with High Sierra's APFS file system. OWC is also offering support for customers who need help navigating this issue.

In the meantime, MacBook Pro owners who rely on their OWC drive may want to hold off on upgrading to High Sierra until the new SoftRAID driver is released. Alternatively, users could try to update their OWC drive's driver software if possible or choose to update their system through an external drive that is compatible with High Sierra's APFS file system.

In conclusion, while the situation may be frustrating for some MacBook Pro owners, it's important to remember that updates can sometimes cause compatibility issues. It's up to device manufacturers to keep on top of these updates and ensure their products remain compatible with the latest operating systems. In the case of OWC drives, the company is working to correct the issue, and in the meantime, there are options available to users.

## Chosen Solution
 Upgraded my Mac Beginning this year with an OWC Aura 480GB drive,
now I cannot upgrade to high sierra for OWC drives to not support the filesystem change. So invested 450â‚¬ and now got stuck.
Manufacturer does not help at all. Offers a new line of drives costing the same. So another half thousand bucks???
Does please anybody have an idea what I could do?
Thanks very much in advance

 The problem is both OWC's & Apples!
From The SSD Review
"The OWC Aura contains two SMI 2246 XT 4-channel controllers which are situated in a RAID configuration through a Marvell 9230 RAID controller. There are four unbranded 256MB MLC synchronous NAND flash chips which, once paired, create a RAID 0 volume with a 1TB capacity."
Basically, they tried to maximize the performance on what chips they where using. I personally think this is more an Apple mess up than OWC's.
OWC could have posted something to at least acknowledge the issue or contacted you if you gave them your email address. All we got was a MacRumors  posting with no follow up. Or, info on where to look for news.
The Apple piece is the current release of APFS does not support RAID drives!
So what to do?? Sorry to say you'll need to wait a bit more until Apple fixes APFS to support RAID on the boot drive and if needed OWC to update their onboard firmware and/or device driver.

 You need the Aura Pro Xb.  It is compatible with High Sierra.
