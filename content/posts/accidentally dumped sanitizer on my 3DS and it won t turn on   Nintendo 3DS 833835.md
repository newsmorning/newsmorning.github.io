Title: I Thought My Nintendo 3DS Was Done For After This Disastrous Accident, But You Won't Believe What Saved It!

Introduction:

Gaming devices have become an integral part of our lives. They help us unwind and escape from the daily grind. They take us to new worlds filled with adventures and exciting challenges. Unfortunately, accidents happen, and our beloved gaming devices can get damaged. That's what happened to my Nintendo 3DS. I had a disastrous accident that left me in despair. However, what happened next was nothing short of a miracle.

Body:

I had just finished playing my 3DS when I accidentally knocked over a glass of water, which spilled all over my device. My heart sank as water seeped into every nook and cranny of my 3DS. I immediately switched it off, but I knew that I may have done irreparable damage. I tried drying it with a towel, but it was of no use. I sensed that my 3DS was done for, and I had no choice but to wave goodbye to it.

However, something strange happened after that. A few days later, I saw my 3DS laying on the desk, and out of sheer curiosity, I pressed the power button. To my surprise, it started working! I couldn't believe it! How did it come back to life after such a disaster? It was then that I realized the power of rice.

Rice has been known to absorb moisture and save water-drenched electronic devices. I had accidentally left my 3DS in a bag of rice for a few days, not expecting anything to happen, but something did happen, and it was nothing short of a miracle. The rice had absorbed all the moisture in my 3DS and had saved it from going to the dustbin.

Conclusion:

My Nintendo 3DS was saved from disaster, and it was all thanks to a simple household ingredient – rice. It's amazing how something so common can be so useful. I know that I'll always keep a bag of rice in my house, just in case something similar happens in the future. This little incident has taught me to never give up hope, and that sometimes, miracles can happen when we least expect them to.

 Hi
The impurities in liquids (except distilled water) causes corrosion and provides circuit paths for the electricity which were not in the game console’s operating design and could damage the components. The corrosion starts immediately and is ongoing until it is completely cleaned away
First do not try to charge or to turn on your console and then remove the battery as soon as possible from the console to minimize any further damage.
Then you need to dis-assemble the rest of the device and  clean all the affected parts using Isopropyl Alcohol 99%+ (available at electronics parts stores) to remove all traces of corrosion and water. If possible, do not use "rubbing alcohol" as in some cases this is only 70% IPA or less, can contain additives and is not as effective. If you do have to use it, check the label to verify the  amount of IPA. The higher the percentage of IPA the better
Here is a link that describes the process. Electronics Water Damage
As always with electronics, especially surface mounted pcb be gentle when handling and especially when brushing away the corrosion. You do not want to remove any components from the board. Remove the shields that may be covering some components as the water may have got in under there as well. The ends of any flex cables and their connectors need to be cleaned also.
Hopefully after you have done all this the console might possibly work correctly again.
Here is a link to the ifixit 3DS Repair guides that will help
If this process seems too daunting, take your console to a reputable, professional electronics repair service, experienced in liquid damage repair and ask for a quote for a repair. If you decide to do this, do it sooner than later. It isn’t going to fix itself
