 Hi
See this as something else to try In the meantime while you are seeing about getting your port fixed through the link that @tech_ni thanks fully provided:-)
Get a torch/flashlight and shine it into the port to check for dust and debris
If there is any get a sewing needle or some tweezers and carefully remove the dust and debris in the port(it can be surprising how much can fit in there!)
If that doesn’t work, turn your iPhone off and  try a very small amount of isopropyl alcohol on a clean toothbrush and scrub away gently and the port to remove any corrosion that may stop it from charging,leave it to dry for a 30mins-hour just to be safe(just don’t get any on the lip between the screen and the chassis incase it gets in!
Hopefully this helps
Any questions please ask
Thanks:-)
