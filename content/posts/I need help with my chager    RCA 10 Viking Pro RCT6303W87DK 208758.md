# Can't Get Your RCA 10 Viking Pro Charged? Here's the Surprising Solution!

If you own an RCA 10 Viking Pro tablet, you know how essential it is to keep it charged. However, if you're struggling to get your device charged up, you're probably wondering what to do next.

Before you start searching for a replacement charger or taking your tablet to a professional for repair, there's one surprisingly simple solution you might want to try: rebooting your device.

Resetting your tablet to its default settings can help to fix any software-related issues that could be causing your charging problems. Even if your tablet isn't turning on or it's stuck in a boot loop, there's still hope.

Here's how to reset your RCA 10 Viking Pro tablet in a few easy steps:

1. Press and hold the power button until your tablet turns off.

2. Wait a few seconds, then press and hold the power button again.

3. At the same time, press and hold the "volume up" button.

4. Continue holding both buttons until you see an "Android" logo on your screen.

5. Wait a few seconds, then release both buttons.

6. Use the "volume down" button to scroll to "wipe data/factory reset," then press the "power" button to select it.

7. Confirm your choice by selecting "yes" with the "power" button.

8. Wait for your tablet to reset and restart.

Once your device has reset, try charging it again with your existing charger. If your tablet isn't charging or turning on, it could be due to a faulty charging port or battery. In this case, you may need to take your device to a professional for repair.

If you're still having issues with your RCA 10 Viking Pro tablet not charging, here are a few additional troubleshooting tips to try:

- Verify that your charger is compatible and connected properly.
- Check your tablet's battery and charging port for any visible damage.
- Try charging your device with another compatible charger to see if the issue is with your existing charger.
- Perform a soft reset by holding down the power button for at least 30 seconds.
- Consider updating your tablet's software or firmware to the latest version.

In conclusion, if you're struggling to get your RCA 10 Viking Pro tablet charged, don't despair. A simple reset could help fix any software-related issues causing your charging problems. However, if your device still won't charge, it's wise to seek professional help to get it back up and running.
