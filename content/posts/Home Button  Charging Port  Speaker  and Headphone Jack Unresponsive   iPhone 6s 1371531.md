You Won't Believe What's Causing Your iPhone 6s to Go Deaf and Blind - The Shocking Truth About Its Malfunctioning Home Button, Charging Port, Speaker, and Headphone Jack Revealed!

When was the last time you experienced a malfunctioning home button, charging port, speaker, or headphone jack on your iPhone 6s? It's not uncommon to face such issues with our devices, but did you know that the cause of such problems may not always be what you think it is?

In this article, we will explore the shocking truth about what's causing your iPhone 6s to go deaf and blind and how to fix it!

The Malfunctioning Home Button:

The home button on an iPhone 6s can malfunction due to a variety of reasons, such as dust, debris, or even water damage. However, one of the most common causes of a malfunctioning home button is a faulty flex cable.

You can easily check if your home button's flex cable is the culprit by pressing down on it. If it feels loose or wobbly, then it's likely that the flex cable is damaged and needs to be replaced.

The Malfunctioning Charging Port:

The charging port is another component that can cause frustration for iPhone 6s users. If your device's charging port is not working correctly, you may not be able to charge your phone or transfer data between your phone and computer.

One potential cause of a malfunctioning charging port is debris or lint buildup. Over time, lint and dust can accumulate in the charging port, preventing the charging cable from making a solid connection.

To fix this issue, you can use a toothpick or tweezers to gently remove any debris from the charging port. Alternatively, you can use a can of compressed air to blow out any dust or debris that may be lodged in the port.

The Malfunctioning Speaker:

A malfunctioning speaker on your iPhone 6s can be frustrating, especially if it happens in the middle of an important phone call or while listening to your favorite music.

One common cause of a malfunctioning speaker is a blocked speaker grille. You can check if this is the case by using a small brush or toothbrush to gently clean the speaker grille.

Another potential cause of a malfunctioning speaker is water damage. If your phone has been exposed to water, the speaker may need to be replaced.

The Malfunctioning Headphone Jack:

A malfunctioning headphone jack on your iPhone 6s can prevent you from listening to music, making phone calls, or using your phone's microphone.

One of the most common causes of a malfunctioning headphone jack is debris or lint buildup. Over time, lint and dust can accumulate in the headphone jack, preventing the headphone plug from making a solid connection.

To fix this issue, you can use a toothpick or tweezers to gently remove any debris from the headphone jack. Alternatively, you can use a can of compressed air to blow out any dust or debris that may be lodged in the jack.

In Conclusion:

When it comes to troubleshooting a malfunctioning iPhone 6s, there are several potential causes to consider. Whether it's a faulty flex cable causing the home button to malfunction, debris or lint buildup causing issues with the charging port or headphone jack, or water damage causing problems with the speaker, there are steps you can take to diagnose and fix the issue.

Remember, if you're not comfortable diagnosing or repairing your device yourself, it's always a good idea to take it to a professional for assistance. By taking care of your iPhone 6s and performing regular maintenance, you can help prevent these types of issues from occurring in the first place and ensure that your device stays in good working condition for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 My iPhone 6s had a third-party screen replacement in August. After the screen was replaced, they did not put the two pentalobe screws back in the bottom. A couple months ago my home button became unresponsive. Today after my phone fell about two feet, my screen came off (attached still by flex cable so it still works). Now, my charging port, headphone jack, and bottom speaker no longer work.
The flex cables are not torn. From what I understand from other sources is that these cables need the appropriate pressure on them in order to properly respond. If I apply pressure on the bottom right portion of the main display (not glass), my headphone jack works. If I apply pressure to the bottom right corner of the glass, my home button and charging port work. I haven't been able to get the speaker to work at all though. The phone also no longer vibrates.
Do you believe this problem would be solved by putting in the two bottom pentalobe screws, or do you think there is more internal, not-obvious damage to the phone ? Would replacing the charging port/headphone flex cable fix the speaker and vibration problem?
Thank you in advance.

 @mirandajesse you got a lot going on there. No, replacing the two screws is not going to fix it. Start by replacing the lightning connector and then re-evaluate. iPhone 6s Lightning Connector Assembly Replacement The home button may not be working due to the screen coming out and possibly tearing the flex. Consider replacing that through Apple to maintain your Touch ID finger print scanner. iPhone 6s Home Button Assembly Replacement

 There is more internal problem with your device. The phone should work fine without the pentalobe screws.
