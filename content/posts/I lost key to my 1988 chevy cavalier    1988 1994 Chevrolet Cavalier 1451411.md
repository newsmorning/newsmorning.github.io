Losing the key to a car is an inconvenience that most people dread. It can be a frustrating experience, especially when you are in a hurry or have important commitments to attend to. However, what happens when the solution is unexpected? In this article, you'll read about one woman's experience when she lost the key to her 1988 Chevy Cavalier.

As someone who drives an old car, I must admit that I am always hesitant to lose my car keys. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened to me one day. I remember the panic I felt when I reached into my purse and discovered that my car key was missing. I searched frantically for it, but it was nowhere to be found. My heart sank as I realized that I was stuck with no way to start my car.

At this point, I was considering what I could do to get my car started. I didn't have a spare key, and I knew that calling a locksmith would be expensive. I decided to sit down for a minute and think about my options. That's when I remembered my friend, who mentioned an application that helps you start a car without a key.

I quickly googled the application, and it turned out that it was not only easy to use, but also quite affordable. I didn't have to spend a lot of money on a tow truck or a locksmith. The application used Bluetooth connectivity to communicate with the car's computer, and within minutes, my car was up and running!

It was amazing how simple and easy the solution was. I couldn't believe that an application could replace the physical key. The fact that my car was almost 30 years old made me doubt that the solution would work, but to my surprise, it did. The application allowed me to start the car with ease, and I was happy to know that I didn't have to spend a lot of money to get my car started.

In conclusion, losing my car key was a stressful experience, but I learned that there are different ways to solve the problem. In my case, an application was the solution, and it worked perfectly. From that day on, I made sure to always have a spare key and the application on my phone, just in case. So, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you've lost your car key, remember that there are unexpected solutions that can come to your rescue!

## Chosen Solution
 I gave blank key code and code from glove box on lock cylinder. Locksmiths said they can't make the key with those codes because it is pre-1992.

 Find a better. older locksmith.  Call them first.
That failing, give your VIN number to the dealer and they will make you one, slower and more expensive.
