## Chosen Solution
 Hi all, when watching TV on any input or any smart facility (on board Netflix, YouTube etc) around once an hour the TV would flicker then go into a colour cycle like a colour test. This would be resolved by putting the TV into standby then turning back on.
I tried swapping the T Con board but when hooked back up it is now only showing the colour cycle. Sound can still be heard in the background.
Any ideas anyone? I'm thinking popping the old t con back in to see if I get a picture back and then maybe trying a new main board?
Cheers

 @bthomson82 doesnâ€™t sound like a T-Con board error. Yes, try your old board and see if you then get the picture back. My number one suspect for this is the main board. Hisense is still consider a bit off brand so schematics etc., are not readily available so we depend on your hands and eyes to tell us what is going on with it.
