# Unleash the Undead Army: Learn How to Dominate Loop Hero with the Ultimate Necromancer Guide!

Loop Hero is a unique and addictive game that challenges the player's ability to create a perfect loop and gather resources while facing dangerous monsters. One of the most popular classes in the game is the Necromancer, who has the ability to control the undead and use them to defeat enemies.

In this ultimate Necromancer guide, we will show you how to unleash your undead army and dominate Loop Hero like a pro.

## Basic Skills of a Necromancer

Before we start discussing advanced tactics, let's take a look at the basic skills of a Necromancer that you need to master first. The Necromancer has three main skills:

### 1. Skeletons

The Necromancer can create Skeletons from the bones of fallen enemies. Skeletons are weak but numerous and are excellent at soaking up damage and distracting enemies. As you progress through the game, upgrade your Skeletons to deal more damage.

### 2. Vampires

Vampires are a more advanced version of Skeletons. They have better stats than their weaker counterparts and can absorb health from enemies. Use Vampires to sustain your army while they fight on your behalf.

### 3. Necromancer's Lab

The Necromancer's Lab is the place where you create your undead army. It is also where you upgrade your Skeletons and Vampires to make them stronger. Use the Lab to manage your army and upgrade them to become unbeatable.

## Advanced Tactics of a Necromancer

Now that you have a grasp of the basics, let's take a look at advanced tactics that will help you dominate Loop Hero as a Necromancer.

### 1. Card Count

You need to keep track of how many Skeletons and Vampires you have on the board. Don't let enemies kill them all, or you'll be stuck with no army. Play the cards wisely, and if there are too many enemies, use your Necromancer's Lab to create more troops.

### 2. Place your troops carefully

Your army can only engage in combat if they are adjacent to enemies. Place your Skeletons and Vampires accordingly to maximize their effectiveness. Also, keeping your army near health camps will allow Vampires to sustain themselves.

### 3. Upgrade your troops

Regularly upgrade your Skeletons and Vampires in the Necromancer's Lab. With each upgrade, they gain more health, defense, and damage, becoming tougher and more lethal. Upgrading your army will make them more potent in combat.

### 4. Use your skills strategically

The Necromancer has skills like Summon Bones and Call Vampire, which help in creating an army or replenishing it. Use them wisely to supplement your troops and maintain their strength during battles.

## Conclusions

The Necromancer is a formidable class in Loop Hero, with the ability to summon an undead army to battle against dangerous enemies. To be successful as a Necromancer, you need to master the basic skills, create a robust army, upgrade troops regularly, and use skills strategically. With these tactics, you can dominate Loop Hero and emerge victorious from every battle. So, prepare your army of skeletons and vampires, and let the undead reign supreme!
