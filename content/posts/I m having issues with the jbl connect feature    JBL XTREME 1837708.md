# JBL Xtreme Owners Beware: The Shocking Truth About the Malfunctioning JBL Connect Feature!

As music lovers, having a high-quality portable Bluetooth speaker is essential. The JBL Xtreme has been a popular choice since it was first introduced. The Xtreme is known for its powerful sound, long battery life, and waterproof design, making it a great option for outdoor parties and beach trips. However, there is a shocking truth about the speaker's malfunctioning JBL Connect feature that many people are not aware of.

JBL Connect is a feature that allows the user to connect multiple JBL speakers to create a surround sound experience. It was specifically designed to work with the JBL Xtreme, but unfortunately, the feature has been malfunctioning for many users. The issue isn't with the speaker itself but rather the JBL Connect app.

Many JBL Xtreme owners have reported that the app doesn't recognize their speaker or doesn't connect the speaker to other JBL devices. The problem has been frustrating because it means that people are unable to use the JBL Connect feature, which is one of the main selling points of the Xtreme.

JBL has acknowledged the issue and has released a statement saying that they are working on a fix. However, there is no clear timeline for when the fix will be available. In the meantime, people who own the JBL Xtreme and want to use the JBL Connect feature are left disappointed.

There isn't a clear solution to the problem other than waiting for JBL to fix the app. Some users have reported success using different versions of the JBL Connect app, while others have had no luck. It's important to note that using an older version of the app might not be a safe option, as it could potentially expose the user to security vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, the JBL Xtreme is still a great portable Bluetooth speaker, but the malfunctioning JBL Connect feature is a big disappointment for many users. It's important to keep in mind that JBL is working to fix the issue, but for the time being, there isn't a clear solution. If you're someone who wants to use the JBL Connect feature, it might be worth waiting for the fix or exploring alternative options.

## Chosen Solution
 When I connect my JBL Xtreme to my Charge 3, the audio cuts in and out between either speaker. Is this a common issue or is one of the speakers possibly defective?

 I have the same issue, when I use connect +, it crackles and cuts out. Even when they are 1 foot apart. I reset both speakers.

 Delete all speakers from Bluetooth and keep only one .

 1st: Remove all stuffs from bluetooth devices.
2nd: add only one speaker. (Do not add others speakers)
3rd: Connect the device previous added, and play musicâ€¦ after that, click on de speaker button (connect +) and repeat this (click to Connect + button - top of speaker) on others speakers.

 So I finally found the reason for the crackling and cutting out in my situation.  It was disturbances from other devices near by that are paired with (and trying to connect to) my phone that I was playing music from.  Solution:
Identify bluetooth devices (other speakers, headphones etc) in your home that are paired with the device you are playing music from and turn them off.Hard reset the jbl speakers your are trying to connect together.Connect one of the jbl speakers to your music source (phone, etc).Start playing music.Connect the jbl speakers using the connect feature.

 Ok I have got 2 boombox for a wile now and never have a issue so from one day to another it start giving me this problem I could figure out what could have changed so one thing i noticed that i have both speakers conected to Bluetooth on my phone even if i turn off the Bluetooth on one problem continue but when i forget one of the speakers on my phone the problem disappeared immediately this fixed my problem now I can listen music of the Bluetooth whit out auxiliar giev it a try
