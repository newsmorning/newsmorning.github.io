# WARNING: Laptop Users Beware! Changing Boot Device to USB Could Render Your HP Laptop Useless with a Mysterious Black Screen of Death!

Laptop users beware! If you own an HP Laptop and you are planning to change the boot device to USB, you may want to think twice before you do so. This is because many HP Laptop users have reported facing a mysterious black screen of death after changing the boot device to USB.

So what exactly is the black screen of death? As the name suggests, it is a situation where your laptop screen goes completely black, and nothing seems to respond to any of your inputs. You can feel the laptop is on, but the screen remains completely dark. It is indeed a frustrating situation to be in, and unfortunately, many HP Laptop users have experienced this problem.

The black screen of death can occur due to various reasons, and one of the most common causes is when you change the boot device to USB. The reason is that many HP Laptop models have a BIOS that does not support the USB boot device. This means that when you try to boot from a USB device, the laptop cannot recognize it, and as a result, it crashes.

So, what can you do to avoid encountering the black screen of death? The best solution is to stick with the boot device that your laptop originally came with. However, if you must change the boot device to USB, there are some steps you can take to mitigate the risk.

Firstly, you should always make sure that you have the latest BIOS version installed on your HP Laptop. Check the manufacturer's website regularly to see if there are any updates available, and if there are, download and install them.

Secondly, before changing the boot device to USB, make sure that the USB boot device you are using is compatible with your laptop's BIOS. If you are not sure about the compatibility, it is best to avoid using the USB device altogether.

Finally, if you do encounter the black screen of death after changing the boot device to USB, do not panic. The situation can often be fixed by restoring the original boot device or performing a system restore.

In conclusion, the black screen of death is a frustrating and mysterious problem that many HP Laptop users have encountered after changing the boot device to USB. To avoid this problem, stick with the original boot device or take the necessary precautions before changing to USB. Remember to keep your laptop's BIOS up to date, ensure the compatibility of your USB device, and know how to perform a system restore. By following these steps, you can avoid the black screen of death and keep your HP Laptop running smoothly.

 Hey guys,
So i was working on a repair for a HP laptop for a kid whos mom died and he needed to bypass the password to get the information. All i did was get into BIOS, i turned safe boot off, and set the boot priority to boot off of USB, but when i restarted the PC im just getting a black screen. Do you guys have any suggestions?

 You can try to repair the windows installation during bootup. OR if you can still get into the bios you should check your settings to see if you can change your hard drive type from auto to ahci that may work for you. just remember to set it back once complete
