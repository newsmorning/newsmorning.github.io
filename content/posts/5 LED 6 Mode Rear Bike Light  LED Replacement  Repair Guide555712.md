Revive Your Dead Bike Light in 5 Easy Steps - DIY Repair Guide Inside!

Cycling at night is a thrilling experience, but it can be dangerous if you don't have adequate lighting. Fortunately, bike lights are readily available and easy to install. However, they also have a tendency to malfunction or stop working altogether, leaving you in the dark.

But don't be disheartened! In this article, we'll teach you how to repair your bike light in just 5 easy steps. No need to throw it away and buy a new one!

Step 1: Remove the light from your bike

The first step to repair your bike light is to remove it from your bike. Unscrew or unclip the light from your bike's handlebar or seat post, depending on where it's mounted.

Step 2: Remove the battery

Next, remove the battery from the light. Most bike lights have a cover that slides off, revealing the battery compartment. You may need to use a small flathead screwdriver to release the battery.

Step 3: Clean the battery contacts

Now that the battery is out, it's time to clean the contacts. Look for any corrosion or dirt that may have accumulated on the contacts. You can use a simple solution of water and vinegar (50:50) to clean the contacts. Using a cotton swab, gently clean the contacts with the solution, then dry them with a clean cloth.

Step 4: Replace the battery

Put the battery back into the light, making sure it's properly aligned with the contacts. If the battery was the only issue, your light should now work again! If it still isn't working, move on to step 5.

Step 5: Check the bulb and wiring

If the battery wasn't the problem, it's time to check the bulb and wiring. Use a small screwdriver to unscrew the back of the light and check the bulb. If the bulb looks burnt out or damaged, it needs to be replaced. You can purchase replacement bulbs at any bike shop or online.

If the bulb is not the problem, gently check the wiring to see if any wires are loose or disconnected. If you find any issues with the wiring, carefully solder them back together.

Once you've fixed any issues with the bulb or wiring, put the back of the light back on, reinsert the battery, and try turning it on again. If it works, congratulations! You've successfully repaired your bike light.

In conclusion, repairing your bike light is a simple task that anyone can do. By following these 5 easy steps, you can revive a dead bike light and ensure that you're always safe and visible while cycling at night. Happy cycling!

Step 6

                  Remove LEDs               


 
- 
 - Warm up the soldering iron
 - 
 - Tin the tip of the soldering iron
 - 
 - Apply a small amount of solder to the tip
 - 
 - Wipe on a damp sponge
 - 
 - Touch the tip of the soldering iron to the led solder to liquify it
 - 
 - Apply solder wick to absorb solder
 - 
 - This guide uses a desoldering pump  instead of desoldering wick. The wick would work better.

                  Insert New LED               


 
- 
 - Place the new LED through the open holes
 - 
 - The LED should cover the schematic symbol on the circuit board and the flat edge of the LED should line up with the tip of the diode symbol shown by the arrow
 - 
 - If the LED does not stay, you can tape it in place on the opposite side of the board
 - 
 - Warm up the trace on the circuit board and the LED lead with the soldering iron
 - 
 - Wipe your soldering iron on the damp sponge every time you pick it up
 - 
 - Apply solder to the lead until the hole completely fills with solder

Step 9


 
- 
 - Reassemble by following the teardown in reverse order
 - 
 - You now have a customized bike light or a working LED!
 - 
 - We replaced the middle LED with blue and the two outside LEDs with white. We set the bike light on the last mode. Enjoy!
 - 
 - Certain colors of LEDs may be illegal as rear bike lights. Use at your own risk or for a different application!
