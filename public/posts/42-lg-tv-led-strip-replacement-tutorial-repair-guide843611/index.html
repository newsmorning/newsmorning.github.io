We ensure that with this tutorial, you will have both a functional and bright TV in no time.\nStep 1: Check Your TV for LED Strip Damage\nThe first step to fixing your LG TV is to identify the root of the problem. Therefore, begin by examining the TV to determine whether the LED strip is the issue. Usually, a broken or damaged LED strip results in one side of the screen appearing dimmer than the other or a dark line appearing across the screen. If you notice any of these signs, then chances are your LG TV has an LED strip problem.\nStep 2: Order a Replacement LED Strip\nWith your LG TV problem identified, the next step is to purchase a replacement LED strip. You can get this from either an online store or a physical store near you. However, ensure that you buy the right LED strip for your LG TV model.\nStep 3: Gather the Tools and Prepare Your Workstation\nBefore you start repairing the LG TV, you need to have the right tools at hand. Therefore, gather a screwdriver, pliers, and a soft cloth for cleaning the display. Also, prepare your workstation by laying a soft cloth on the table to protect your TV from scratches and other damages.\nStep 4: Remove the TV Back Cover\nWith your workstation prepared, you can now start disassembling the TV. Begin by removing the back cover using a screwdriver. However, take care not to damage any wires or other components.\nStep 5: Remove the Damaged LED Strip\nNext, locate the damaged LED strip and remove it by pulling the strips off the frame using pliers. It would help to take a photo of the TV’s interior to ensure you install the new LED strip correctly.\nStep 6: Install the New LED Strip\nOnce you remove the damaged LED strip, install the new strip carefully. Place the new LED strip on the same side that the damaged one came from, using the adhesive tape to hold it in place. Reconnect the connectors and replace the screws to hold everything in place.\nStep 7: Check and Close the TV\nWith the new LED strip in place, reconnect the TV connectors and turn on the TV to check if everything is working correctly. Suppose the display is functioning correctly; turn off the TV and replace the back cover by reinserting the screws.\nConclusion:\nWith this 42 LED strip replacement tutorial, fixing your LG TV will be quick, easy and stress-free. You do not have to wait for a technician or pay hefty repair fees, as you can do this on your own.
