Here’s What You NEED to Know Before It’s Too Late!” date = “2021-10-05” author = “Hugo” tags = [“iPhone 7”, “Home Button”]\n+++\nIf you are an iPhone user, you know how significant the home button is. It acts as the control center of your device, responsible for taking you to the home screen or initiating the multitasking view among other functions. However, there have been reports of iPhone 7 home button malfunctions, and it’s crucial to be aware of the issue before it’s too late.\nWhat’s the problem with the iPhone 7’s Home Button?\nThe iPhone 7 is an excellent device that delivered some significant upgrades when it was launched. However, one major issue started to surface after a while of usage; the home button stopped working. This is due to the fact that the device’s home button is not a physical button but a touchpad that uses Apple’s Taptic engine to simulate button presses. Consequently, when the operating system is down, it is nearly impossible to get the iPhone 7’s home button fixed without professional help.\nWhat Causes iPhone 7’s Home Button to Fail?\nVarious reasons cause the iPhone 7’s home button to malfunction. One of the most notable is a damaged touch ID sensor. Most users have reported that after accidentally exposing their device to moisture, the home button became unresponsive. Users who have tried fixing the problem themselves have ended up making it worse.\nHow Can You Tell If Your iPhone 7’s Home Button is Dying?\nLike most other malfunctions, your iPhone 7 will likely give you signs that its home button is dying. Here are a few things to watch out for:\nThe home button feels unresponsive or “sticky.” The function of the home button starts to slow down. The home button stops working entirely. What Can You Do if Your iPhone 7 Home Button is Failing?\nIf your iPhone 7’s home button is unresponsive, there are a few steps you can take before seeking professional help. One common remedy is to do a hard reset on your device. This involves pressing and holding both the home button and the power button simultaneously until the Apple logo appears. If this doesn’t solve the problem, then making an appointment with Apple and seeking professional help is the next best option.\nTo Sum Up\nIf you own an iPhone 7 or are planning to buy one, it’s necessary that you’re aware of the issue with its home button. Be mindful of any signs indicating that the home button is failing and try to take care of the device to avoid moisture exposure. If you notice any malfunctions with your iPhone 7’s home button, don’t hesitate to seek professional help. Remember to take care of your iPhone and enjoy its features fully.\nChosen Solution I switched an iphone 7 screen … I was super careful about the home button .. plug in the new screen got up “home button needs service” so i tried with another screen and got up the same .. so i tried with the old screen and Then I got up “can not enable touch id” Then I went back to the new screen and got “home button needs service” I know I did not destroy that home button, but after using 3 different new screens (never used). Help please?\nThe home button of iPhone 7 is SUPER temperamental. Any slight tugging on the cable may break it, or if the screen has any problem that results the system not recognizing the button once, it is likely to stay that way Try a restore on both old and new screen, this should at least hope to override the software lockup.\nSolved The lcd bracket is pinching the cables at the bottom… Solution: Bottom left screw ( only non Y screw) screw it in without bracket, and let the bracket lay on top allowing room for the cable rather than crushing them. This only works if you tested your home button and it works with your old screen… if home button doesnt work on either it might be the home button.\nI have had the exact same case, my best guess is the flex ribbon on the home button is damaged or could be the pin connectors.\nI got that message when my phone fell in Water and to dry it I banged my phone against my bed several times, an hour later that message showed up. Later that day even the speakers and haptic feedback failed. At that point I was pretty sure that the logic board was failing slowly. The next day I resetted my phone and boom the home button was back. So it was a coincidence.\n","wordCount":"797","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Erin Lebron"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-needs-service-iphone-7-57381/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>URGENT ALERT: Is Your iPhone 7 Home Button DYING?
