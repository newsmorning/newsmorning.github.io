## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
during the opening of my Apple Watch 4 serie, I broke  the adhesive on the edge where the display cables are running, cutting the two connections towards the two corners on the bottom of the case.
Question: which is the technical function of this adhesive?  is it strictly necessary? Is it available as spare part?
Thank you
Regards,
Giancarlo

 Hi
The screen connector adhesive you are on about that really only holds down some black tape to cover the connectors so I wouldn’t worry about that:-)
Hopefully this answers your question
If you need any help please ask
Thanks:-)

 @gianko - The black copper tape is an EMI shield and you do need to be careful as you don't want it shorting out things. How about posting a picture or two so we can see things Adding images to an existing question
