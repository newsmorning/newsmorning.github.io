Zombie Hunters, Rejoice! Dead Rising 4 is Finally Making its Way to Steam Next Month

If you're a fan of zombie games, then you must have heard about the Dead Rising series. For those who don't know, Dead Rising is a popular video game franchise that's all about hacking and slashing your way through hordes of zombies. The newest installment, Dead Rising 4, was previously exclusive to Xbox One and Windows 10, but now it's finally making its way to Steam next month. 

Are you excited yet? If not, then let me tell you a little bit about what you can expect from Dead Rising 4. The game takes place sixteen years after the events of the first Dead Rising game and follows the return of the series' original protagonist, Frank West. This time, Frank finds himself in the town of Willamette, Colorado, which has been overrun by zombies due to a new outbreak.

As Frank, you must use a variety of weapons and vehicles to survive the zombie apocalypse and uncover the truth behind the outbreak. The game features a vast open-world environment filled with unique locations to explore, side missions to complete, and collectibles to find. 

What sets Dead Rising 4 apart from other zombie games is its wacky, over-the-top humor and its use of ridiculous weapons. Want to use a toy sword to defeat a group of zombies? Go ahead. Feel like combining a lawn mower and a shopping cart to make a deadly vehicle? Sure thing. 

The game also features a cooperative multiplayer mode that allows you to team up with up to three friends to take on the undead together. With so much content and gameplay, it's no wonder that Dead Rising 4 has been touted as one of the best zombie games in recent years.

Now that it's finally coming to Steam, even more people will get to experience the fun and excitement of Dead Rising 4. No longer limited to Xbox One and Windows 10, the game will now be available to a wider audience of PC gamers. 

Dead Rising 4 on Steam will include all previously released DLC, as well as new content such as the Capcom Heroes mode, which allows you to play as classic characters from Capcom games and use their unique abilities to fight zombies.

So, if you're a fan of zombies, open-world games, or just want to have some ridiculous fun, be sure to mark your calendars for Dead Rising 4's release on Steam next month. Join Frank West in his latest adventure and save the town of Willamette from the zombie apocalypse. Happy hunting, zombie hunters!

The long awaited Dead Rising 4 is finally out on both Windows PCs and Xbox One consoles. As a player, you’ll join ultimate zombie slayer Frank West on his return home for the holidays. Your task is to investigate the source of a mysterious zombie outbreak and, of course, stop it.
 
Many fans rushed to Steam to get the game, but were surprised to see that there is no Dead Rising 4 Steam page. As a quick reminder, Dead Rising 4 will be exclusively available in the Windows Store for the first 90 days of release. The game will also be an Xbox One timed exclusive for an entire year.
 
### Dead Rising 4 comes to Steam in March 2017
 
In other words, if you want to buy Dead Rising 4 from Steam, you’ll need to wait until early March 2017. As surprising as this may sound, many fans who are willing to wait until March to get their hands on the game.
 
Dead Rising 4 on Xbox One is developed by Capcom and will be published in partnership with Microsoft. Fans will be able to play ‘Dead Rising 4’ first on Xbox One and Windows 10 PC this December. It will remain a Windows 10 exclusive for the first 90 days and console exclusive on Xbox One for one year.
 
Actually, this is a very wise choice. Dead Rising 4 will definitely be affected by many technical issues, especially on Windows PCs. There are too many possible PC configurations for the game developers to test them all. As a result, it’s impossible to detect all the potential  bugs that could affect the game.
 
Most likely, Capcom will have detected and fixed all the major Dead Rising 4 issues by March 2017. This means that the players who install the game next year will enjoy a better, more stable gaming experience.
