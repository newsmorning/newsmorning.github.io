# Desperate Laptop Owners Rejoice: Discover Secret Tips for Fixing Your Out Of Warranty Lenovo Laptop!

Laptops are an essential part of our daily life, be it students or working professionals, we all rely on our laptops for numerous tasks. However, nothing is perfect in this world, and laptops are no exception. With regular use, a laptop can break down or malfunction, leaving its owners in a state of despair.

One of the most popular laptop brands in the market is Lenovo. Lenovo laptops are known for their durability, reliability, and user-friendly features. However, even a Lenovo laptop can run into problems from time to time, and if it's out of warranty, getting it repaired can burn a hole in your pocket.

But do not worry! In this article, we will reveal some secret tips and tricks that will help you fix your out of warranty Lenovo laptop.

## Tip 1: Restart Your Laptop

It may sound too simple, but restarting your laptop can resolve many issues that you may be facing. Sometimes, due to continuous usage, your laptop's system may overload and become unresponsive, leading to issues like a slow performance, frozen screen, or connection problems. By restarting your laptop, you're allowing it to reset and refresh its system, which could solve the issue.

## Tip 2: Scan for Viruses

Another reason for your Lenovo laptop's malfunctioning could be the presence of viruses or malware. These viruses can cause your system to act unnaturally, making it slow, resulting in frequent crashes or freezing. It is, therefore, vital to regularly scan and remove any viruses that may be present in your laptop. There are several free antivirus software available online that you can download and use for this purpose.

## Tip 3: Check the Hardware

If your Lenovo laptop's screen, keyboard, or touchpad isn't functioning correctly, it's possible that the hardware is faulty. While replacing hardware parts can be costly, it's essential to be sure of the issue before investing in a new component. For instance, if your laptop's touchpad isn't working, try connecting an external mouse to check if the problem persists. If the external mouse works correctly, your laptop's touchpad may need a driver update or could be damaged, which may need to be replaced. 

## Tip 4: Clear Your Laptop's Cache

Over time, your laptop's cache stores temporary files, cookies, and other data that can take up a lot of space and affect its efficiency. Clearing your laptop's cache can help speed up your laptop, making it run faster and smoother. You can do this by accessing your laptop's settings and navigating to internet options, where you'll find an option to clear browsing history.

## Tip 5: Reinstall the Operating System

If all else fails and your Lenovo laptop is still malfunctioning, the last resort would be to reinstall the operating system. This can erase all data and settings from your laptop, but it can resolve any issues that may be irremediable. 

In conclusion, trying these tips could be worth your while, especially if your Lenovo laptop is out of warranty. However, in cases where the damage is severe, it's best to seek professional help. Also, it's essential to take care of your laptop and keep it updated to avoid issues. Nonetheless, with these tips, desperate Lenovo laptop owners can rejoice and fix their laptops, without breaking the bank.

 Hi:
I accidentally sat on my Lenova lap top.   The screen has no image,.  It looks like someone through paint on it.  Can it still be fixed?

 You likely just have to replace the display because the LCD is cracked. To verify make sure you have an image on a external display via HDMI or VGA or DP
