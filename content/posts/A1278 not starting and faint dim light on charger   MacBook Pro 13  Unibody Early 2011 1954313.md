# Is Your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 Dead? Find Out Why It Won't Start and How to Fix the Faint Charger Light!

If you are a proud owner of a MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011, you might have experienced the frustration of not being able to start it. You might have also noticed that even when you connect the charger, the light on it is faint, indicating that the MacBook is not charging. In this article, we will explore some of the reasons why your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 is not starting and how to fix the faint charger light.

## The Reasons Why Your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 Is Not Starting

There could be several reasons why your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 is not starting. Some of the most common reasons include:

### 1. Dead Battery

One of the most common reasons why your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 is not starting is that the battery might be dead. Over time, the battery loses its capacity to hold a charge, and it might eventually die completely.

### 2. Faulty Charger

Another common reason for the MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 not starting is that the charger itself might be faulty. It might not be supplying enough power to the MacBook, or it might be damaged in some way.

### 3. Logic Board Failure

The logic board is the heart of your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011, and if it fails, your MacBook won't start. Logic board failure could be due to several reasons, such as liquid damage, overheating, or simply wear and tear.

### 4. Corrupted Operating System

An outdated or corrupted operating system can also prevent your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 from starting. If your MacBook is stuck on the Apple logo or is not booting up properly, it could be due to a corrupted operating system.

## How to Fix the Faint Charger Light on Your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011

If you have noticed that the charger light on your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 is faint, it could indicate that your MacBook is not charging properly. Here are some steps you can take to fix the faint charger light:

### 1. Check the Charger

The first thing you should do is to check the charger itself. Make sure that the cable is not damaged, and the pins are clean. Try plugging the charger into a different outlet and see if the charger light becomes brighter. If the charger is faulty, you might need to replace it.

### 2. Check the MagSafe Port

The MagSafe port is where you plug in the charger into your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011. Make sure that this port is not damaged or obstructed in any way. Clean the port with a soft, dry brush to remove any debris that might be preventing the charger from making good contact.

### 3. Reset the SMC

The System Management Controller (SMC) is responsible for regulating power management on your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011. Sometimes, resetting the SMC can fix issues related to power management. Here's how to reset the SMC:

- Shut down your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011.
- Connect the MagSafe charger to your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011.
- Hold down the Shift + Control + Option keys and the Power button for 10 seconds.
- Release all the keys and the Power button.
- Press the Power button to turn on your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011.

### 4. Replace the Battery

If your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 is not starting due to a dead battery, you might need to replace it. You can purchase a replacement battery from Apple or an authorized reseller and install it yourself or take it to a tech shop for installation.

### 5. Reinstall macOS

If your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 is not starting due to a corrupted operating system, reinstalling macOS might fix the issue. Before you do this, make sure to backup your data. Here's how to reinstall macOS:

- Turn on your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 while pressing the Command + R keys.
- Select Reinstall macOS from the macOS Utilities window.
- Follow the onscreen instructions to reinstall macOS.

In conclusion, if your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 is not starting, it could be due to several reasons, such as a dead battery, faulty charger, logic board failure, or corrupted operating system. By following the steps outlined above, you can troubleshoot the issue and fix the faint charger light. If none of these steps work, it might be time to take your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Early 2011 to a professional for repair.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi there!
I have a question regarding a MacBook Pro A1278 from a customer.
The customer said the macbook did not start from one to another day after having the famous big cross at his battery saying it needed to be replaced for months now.
The customer tried different chargers all to no success.
What i have tried:
2 Different chargers, of wich 1 is brandnew.
Old DC-In board does the same as a brand new DC-In board, they both show up (with or without internal battery connected) as a faint/dim green light.
Disconnected everything, swapped memory etc, it keeps faint/dim.
All ram resets possible, nothing.
Now what we do know is that the battery is faulty but even without the battery attached on the logic board it does the same, it shows no life whatsoever in any way possible.
I do feel that there was alot of dust on the bottom side, i cleared it all but but it seemed quite alot. Also, a few screw points seem to be a little brownish, it almost seemed like water spills corrosion but i could not find any white residue anywhere on the logic board itself.
Anyone that might have another idea or will this probably be a logic board that died here?
Thanks in advance!

 If you don't get a steady green light on the magsafe tip it's because the charger sense circuit gets an error from the logic board who don't give the OK needed to the charger to send the adequate voltage to power on the machine. Check the voltage on one of the two power pads near the logic board keyboard connector. You need 3.42 volts on one of the two pads. If the logic board is still in the machine, disconnect the keyboard cable before checking the voltage on the power pads because a faulty top case can give you wrong voltage reading. One of the pad is ground so 0 volt and the second pad is G3Hot so 3.42 volts.
To troubleshoot the logic board circuits you'll need the board schematic and the boardview file to identify the components you want to measure on the board. No green light or faint green light means that the "Onewire circuit" is faulty and doesn't provide the 3.42 volts needed to get the steady green light and adequate communication from the SMC to the charger. Also a good visual inspection of the board could help to identify a faulty, corroded or missing component. I use a microscope 10x to 20X for close up view. Pay attention to areas affected by liquid spill.

 The first thing I would do is drop in a fresh battery and run diagnostics again.  Next drop in a hard drive with 10.7.5 on it and a new HD/IR cable.  Lastly. get a flat rate repair from Apple.
