Title: Shocking Discovery: Your AC Heat Window Unit is Keeping You Cold, Not Hot!

Intro:
Winter is here, and every household is gearing up for the season by turning on their heating units. But did you know that your AC heat window unit could actually be making you colder instead of warmer? Yes, you read that right! According to recent studies, window AC units are not as efficient in providing heat as they are in providing cold air. So, before you crank up the heat on your window unit, read on to discover why it may not be the solution to keeping you warm this winter.

Background:
Window AC units are designed to cool your home during the hot summer months, but many people use them as a source of heat during the winter. These units have a heat mode that allows them to provide warm air by reversing the cycle of the refrigerant. However, in practice, the heat generated by these units is generally not enough to adequately warm a room. So instead of giving you the warmth and comfort you desire, your window unit may actually be making you colder.

Why AC heat window units are not efficient in providing heat:
AC heat window units are not as efficient in providing heat as they are in providing cold air. This is because the amount of heat that an AC unit can produce is limited by the size of its compressor. Additionally, heat generated by these units is usually distributed through a fan, making it difficult for it to reach further distances in your home. As a result, your AC heat window unit may not be as effective in warming your rooms as you may have thought.

Other options for heating your home:
If you are looking for a more efficient way to heat your home, consider alternatives such as space heaters or central heating systems. Space heaters are a great option for smaller rooms or apartments, as they are portable and can be moved from one room to another. Central heating systems, on the other hand, are designed to heat your entire home and are much more efficient at doing so than window AC units.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, before you turn on your AC heat window unit this winter, consider the efficiency of the unit in providing heat compared to other options that might be more effective. While window AC units are perfect for cooling your home during the summer, they may not be the best option for heating your home during the colder months. Opt for space heaters or central heating systems instead, for a more efficient way to keep your family warm and comfortable throughout the winter.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a whirlpool ac and heat unit that just quit heating all of the sudden. All other functions work properly. What could have happened or could be wrong? Model # ACE184XK0

 @cdunigan this could be a bad thermostat, failed heating strip as well as multiple other issues. You would have to at least remove the cover and post some images of your unit that let's us see what you see. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that.

 Check so theres still gas inside it, I dont know how you check it on this model.
Usually theres a sensor in one of the pipes that feel the presure of the gas, if you put those two contacts against each other it should start cooling. But dont do it for a longer time, theres often a kind of "oil" in too and if its to little gas/oil you will break it if doing it for a longer time.
You can check for leaks also
