If you're using a Linksys router for your home or office network, you may want to take a closer look at your security settings. A recent investigation revealed a shocking list of default passwords for Linksys routers that could potentially compromise your network.

The investigation, conducted by security researchers, revealed that Linksys routers are shipped with a list of default passwords that are easy to guess and use, leaving users' networks vulnerable. This means that even if you haven't changed your router's default password, an attacker could easily gain access to your network and potentially steal sensitive information.

The default passwords for Linksys routers include common words like "password", "admin", "1234", and even "linksys". These passwords can be quickly and easily guessed by attackers who use automated tools to break into networks.

To make matters worse, many users don't change their router's default password, even though it's recommended by security experts. This leaves their networks open to attack, as anyone who knows the default password can easily gain access to their network.

So, what can you do to protect your network? The first and most important step is to change your router's default password. Make sure to choose a strong, unique password that's difficult to guess. Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to create a strong password that's nearly impossible for attackers to crack.

Additionally, keep your router's firmware up-to-date. Manufacturers release updates to address security vulnerabilities and other issues. By keeping your firmware up-to-date, you can ensure that your router is as secure as possible.

Finally, consider adding additional security to your network, such as a firewall or VPN. These technologies can help prevent unauthorized access to your network and protect your sensitive data.

In conclusion, the Linksys default password list is a serious security issue that should not be taken lightly. If you're using a Linksys router, take action now to protect your network. Change your router's default password, keep your firmware up-to-date, and consider adding additional security to your network. By taking these steps, you can ensure that your network is as secure as possible and protect your sensitive data from potential attacks.

Most Linksys brand routers have a default password of admin and a default IP address of 192.168.1.1, but some differ, as you can see in the table below.

 

More help is below the table if you don't see your Linksys model below, the listed default password won't work, or you have another question.

 
##   Linksys Default Passwords (Valid January 2023)  
 

[1] The Linksys E4200 router comes in two hardware versions, v1 and v2. Version 1 does not require a username, while Version 2 requires admin as the username.

 

[2] The router is controlled from the Linksys app, so you don't need to know the IP address or the router's username or password. 

 

[3] To access the router from a web browser, first set it up using the Linksys app, which is where you create a username and password for the router.

 
##   What to Do When the Linksys Default Data Above Doesn't Work  
 

You only have one choice when your Linksys device's default password or default username has been changed and you don't know what these are: reset the device to factory defaults.

 

For most devices, perform a factory reset by pressing and holding the Reset button for at least 10 seconds (30 seconds on older models) and then unplugging and plugging back in the device.

 

If that doesn't work, check the router or other device's manual to find advice for that Linksys model. You can find your device's manual in PDF format from Linksys Support.

 

A factory reset also returns the IP address that's configured for the Linksys device back to 192.168.1.1, or whatever the default may be, but doing so could cause problems.

 

If you only need your Linksys router's IP address, it's almost always the same as the default gateway that's configured for your computers and other devices that connect to it.

 
##   Don't Forget to Change the Default Linksys Password  
 

There's a default router password for one reason: to get into your router after you purchase it. This easy-to-guess and easy-to-find password should not stick around throughout the life of your router.

 

Change your router's default password once you're logged in to make your network more secure.
