How to Fix Your Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus: The Shocking Reason Why Your Cell Phone Loses 4G ONLY After Leaving Home!

If you have a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, then you may have experienced the issue where your cell phone loses 4G ONLY after leaving your home. This can be a frustrating problem to deal with, especially if you rely on your cell phone for work or to stay connected with loved ones.

The good news is that there is a simple solution to this problem. In this article, we will explore the shocking reason why your cell phone loses 4G ONLY after leaving home, and some quick fixes to get your cell phone back up and running at full strength.

The Shocking Reason Why Your Cell Phone Loses 4G Only After Leaving Home

The most probable cause of your Galaxy S9 Plus losing 4G connectivity after leaving your home is due to the optimization of your network settings by your carrier.

Your carrier may have set a specific network mode setting for you to restrict your phone from a higher network mode, such as the LTE+

This usually happens when you are in a place where you don’t have good coverage from higher network modes or when the signal in your area is poor.

This means that your phone will automatically switch to the 4G network to compensate for this poor signal. When you leave your home, your carrier assumes that you are no longer in an area where you have poor network signal, so your network settings will reset to the default mode.

However, if your carrier has not updated your network settings to include the higher network modes after a signal boost, then you will continue to have issues with your cell phone losing connection to 4G networking.

How to Fix Your Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus

To fix the issue with your Galaxy S9 Plus losing 4G connectivity, you need to manually update your network settings to include the higher network modes such as LTE+. This will ensure that your phone remains connected to the best network mode available.

To do this, you will need to update your APN settings.

- Navigate to your phone’s settings app
- Select “Connections”
- Select “Mobile Networks”
- Select “Access Point Names” (APN’s)
- Tap on the APN that is in use (this is usually labeled as “T-Mobile US” or whichever carrier you have)
- Scroll down to the “APN Type” option and tap on it
- Add “, default, mms, dun” to the end of the string
- Save your settings and restart your phone

This will ensure that your phone is using the correct network mode settings and that you have the best signal possible.

In Conclusion

Losing 4G connectivity after leaving home can be a frustrating issue to deal with. But, with the right settings, you can quickly fix the problem and get your cell phone back to full strength.

By updating your APN settings, you will ensure that your phone is using the correct network mode, including the higher network modes, such as LTE+.

Now that you have this information, you can easily fix your Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and stay connected to the internet wherever you go.

## Chosen Solution
 Samsung and At&t can’t solve this problem as my phone will not connect to 4g when I leave my home. It disconnects from home wifi and then will not connect to 4g unless I turn the phone off or airplane mode on and off. My home wifi is the only wifi this happens with as when in another wifi area where phone is connected it has no problem connect back to mobile data or 4g.

 Try navigating to Settings  > General management > Reset and tap Reset network settings. That will reset your network settings and hopefully solve the problem. Note that this will erase Wi-Fi passwords, and probably Bluetooth devices (not sure, can’t test at the moment).
