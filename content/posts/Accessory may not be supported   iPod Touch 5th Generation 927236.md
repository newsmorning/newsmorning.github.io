## Chosen Solution
 I used a portable charger during a trip and it was originally made for samsung but I plugged the larger part in to it now my iPod says accessory may not be supported with my actual charger do I buy a new one?

 It will charge really slow.  It's another way Apple wants you to spend money.  If you are ok with slow charging you don't need to spend money.  No harm will come to your iDevice.
