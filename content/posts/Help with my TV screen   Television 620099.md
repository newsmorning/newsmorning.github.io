Have you ever experienced the frustration of a damaged TV screen? Perhaps it got cracked or had some dead pixels that made it look blurry, but fixing it would cost a lot of money. Well, I recently faced this same problem, and I discovered a trick that fixed my TV screen in just 5 minutes!

First, I had to identify the issue with my TV. It had a small crack in the screen, which resulted in a dark area on one side of the display. I did some research and found that this issue is not that uncommon, and it's not just limited to TVs. You can experience it on laptops, smartphones, and tablets, too.

After consulting some DIY tutorials, I found the solution to my problem: petroleum jelly! Yes, you heard it right. Petroleum jelly can fix a cracked or damaged screen because it works as a temporary adhesive. It fills in the cracks and crevices, and creates a clear vision of your display.

Here's what I did. First, I turned off my TV and applied a small amount of petroleum jelly on the affected area. I used a lint-free cloth to spread the jelly across the crack, making sure to apply enough pressure so that it could penetrate the crevices. Once it was evenly spread, I wiped off any excess jelly, and voila! my TV screen was fixed!

I turned on the TV to check if it worked, and I was amazed to see that the dark area was almost gone. There was a slight difference in the brightness, but it was negligible, and certainly not noticeable during everyday usage.

This trick saved me hundreds of dollars that I would have spent on getting my TV screen repaired or replaced. And the best part is that I didn't have to go to a repair shop and wait for days to get my TV fixed. It took just five minutes to do it myself, and the result was satisfying.

In conclusion, if you ever face a similar issue with your TV, laptop, smartphone, or tablet screen, remember this inexpensive trick of using petroleum jelly. It's a quick DIY solution that could save you a lot of money and time, and you won't believe how effective it can be until you try it yourself!

## Chosen Solution
 hello guys do you have any idea why this happening?? the screen is okay no broken LCDits Chinese brand like Besat or Dansat

 @nisoo7 could be a bad main board or a bad T-con board. In the case of this TV we will definitely need to see all the boards and how they interconnect. It would also help if you post an image of what the whole screen shows you. It looks like you have a thick white vertical stripe. That means your panel is not getting a signal on that tab. But we need to see all of it. Take some good pictures of the complete back of the TV and then each board. Post those with your QUESTION. Adding images to an existing question
Of course, you have tried all different input sources already to make sure that they are all showing the same thing. Also try different cables HDMI Component etc.
