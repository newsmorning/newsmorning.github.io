#Unlock the Lost Ark 50 Friends Achievement and Receive a MASSIVE 1000 FREE Amethyst Shards! Don't Miss Out!

If you're a fan of Ark: Survival Evolved, you're probably familiar with the Lost Ark Achievement. To unlock it, you need to add 50 friends to your friend list on Steam. This achievement not only adds a sense of camaraderie to the game but also brings with it a lucrative reward of 1000 free amethyst shards. What better way to build your Ark empire than with an abundance of valuable resources?

But if you're wondering what to do with these amethyst shards, don't worry! They are incredibly useful for crafting items in the game, such as the Amethyst Spear, Amethyst Sword, and Amethyst Pickaxe. These items not only look great, but they also have a high durability and increased damage, making them essential tools in any Ark player's arsenal.

So how do you go about unlocking the Lost Ark Achievement? It's simple! All you need to do is add 50 friends to your Steam friend list. You can either do this by searching for specific usernames or by joining Ark-related groups and communities.

It's worth noting that adding random strangers on the game is not ideal. Not only is it a safety risk, but it's also not a guarantee that they will accept your request or even play the game anymore. Instead, consider joining online forums or groups specifically for Ark players, where you can meet like-minded individuals who are more likely to add you to their friend list.

Once you have added 50 friends, the achievement will unlock, and the 1000 free amethyst shards will be added to your inventory. It's that simple! And with these resources at your disposal, you can craft some of the most powerful weapons in the game, giving you an edge in any combat situations or resource gathering expeditions.

In conclusion, if you're an Ark player, don't miss out on the opportunity to unlock the Lost Ark Achievement and receive a massive 1000 free amethyst shards. It's a straightforward process that not only brings a sense of community to the game but also provides you with valuable resources to help you on your journey through the Ark world. So fire up your Steam account, start searching, and get adding those friends!

Lost Ark 50 Friends is a secret achievement that has been discovered which gives players a whopping 1000 Amethyst Shards for free. As the name suggests, what you need to do is have 50 people in your friend list. Now, even though we have gamer friends, the number most likely won’t hit 50.

Will this make the developers remove this particular achievement? We’re not sure. But Amethyst Shards are one of the most important currencies in the game that you can use to buy items from vendors in-game.
