## Chosen Solution
 So, I have a PS4 that is around 4 years old, clean with no dust or bugs, and has never been dropped or harmed by anyone or anything. However, starting about a month ago, my controllers will suddenly disconnect and won't reconnect, and if I'm downloading something, the download will halt and indicate it can't be downloaded. If I do a hard reset, the controller will reconnect, but how long or if it will work is absolutely unpredictable; sometimes it will work for days, and other times it will not.

 I think I might have your answer. I believe that the issue is with the Wi-Fi Antenna. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi run through the same piece of hardware. Try opening the device up and looking at the state of the Antenna. I've attached the guide here.
