If you own a 2016 Nissan Altima, you have a keyless remote to gain entry to your car without the need for a traditional key. The key fob uses a battery to function, and when it’s dead, you’ll have trouble entering your car. To avoid being locked out of your Nissan Altima, it’s important to know how to quickly and easily replace the battery in your key fob. 

In this ultimate guide, we’ll take you through the steps you need to follow to replace the battery in your key fob. With just a few simple steps, you can ensure that you never get locked out of your Nissan Altima again! 

## Step 1: Determine the Correct Battery Size

Before starting the process of replacing the battery, you need to determine the correct battery size for your key fob. You can find this information in your car manual or by checking with your local Nissan dealer. The 2016 Nissan Altima typically uses a CR2032 battery.

## Step 2: Open the Key Fob

To open the key fob, you will need to use a small screwdriver to pry open the back cover of the key fob. You can use a flathead screwdriver or a coin to do this. Once you open the cover, you will see the battery compartment. 

## Step 3: Remove the Dead Battery

Next, you will need to remove the dead battery from the compartment. You can do this by gently pressing the battery with your finger and lifting it out of the compartment. 

## Step 4: Insert the New Battery

Insert the new battery into the compartment with the positive side facing up. Gently press down on the battery until it clicks into place. 

## Step 5: Close the Key Fob

To close the key fob, align the back cover with the front cover and press them together until you hear a click. 

## Step 6: Test the Key Fob 

Before you put your key fob to use, test it out to make sure the battery is working. To test the battery, simply press any button on the key fob. If the battery is working correctly, the key fob will work. 

## Conclusion

With just six simple steps, you can replace the battery in your 2016 Nissan Altima key fob, ensuring you never get locked out again. If you experience any difficulties replacing the battery or if you notice that your key fob is still not working, it may be time to bring your car to your local Nissan dealer to have it checked. Remember to regularly check the battery life of your key fob to avoid being locked out of your car unexpectedly.
