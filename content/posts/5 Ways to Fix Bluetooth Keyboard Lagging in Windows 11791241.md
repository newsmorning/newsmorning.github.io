# Stop Suffering from Laggy Bluetooth Keyboards on Windows 11 with These 5 Simple Fix Tricks!

Using a Bluetooth keyboard on your Windows 11 PC can be convenient and comfortable. But sometimes, the keyboard may have some lag or delay, which can be frustrating, especially when you're typing quickly or working on important documents. Fortunately, there are a few simple tricks that can help you stop suffering from laggy Bluetooth keyboards on Windows 11.

## Trick 1: Update your Bluetooth Drivers

The first step you need to take is to update your Bluetooth drivers. You can usually find the latest drivers on your keyboard manufacturer's website or the Windows update center. Updating your Bluetooth drivers can improve connectivity and eliminate lag issues.

To do this:

1. Press the Windows key + X key.
2. Select the "Device Manager" from the pop-up menu.
3. Expand the "Bluetooth" category.
4. Locate your Bluetooth device, right-click and select "Update driver".
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the driver update process.

## Trick 2: Reduce the Distance

Sometimes, the Bluetooth connection may not be strong enough, and this can cause lag. To resolve this, try reducing the distance between your keyboard and your PC. Bring the keyboard closer to your PC or try using it in a different room. This can help improve connectivity and eliminate lag.

## Trick 3: Remove Interference

Other devices using the same frequency can interfere with your Bluetooth keyboard's signal. This can cause lag and connectivity issues. To avoid this problem, try moving devices that use the same frequency away from your keyboard, turn off unused devices or use 5GHz wireless for your Bluetooth devices instead of 2.4GHz band.

## Trick 4: Disable Other Devices

Sometimes other Bluetooth devices connected to your PC can cause interference with your keyboard. To resolve this, try disabling other Bluetooth devices temporarily. Disconnect all other devices from Bluetooth and try whether the keyboard lags after the disconnection. If the lag is resolved, you may need to identify and replace the problematic device that interferes with your keyboard.

## Trick 5: Change the Batteries

If your Bluetooth keyboard uses batteries, try changing them. Low batteries can cause connectivity problems and lag. Try using high-quality alkaline batteries or a rechargeable battery with a high rating for your keyboard.

In conclusion, these 5 simple tricks can help you stop suffering from laggy Bluetooth keyboards on Windows 11. Updating your drivers, reducing the distance, removing interference, disabling other devices, or changing the batteries are all effective ways to improve the connectivity and eliminate lag. By following these tips, you can enjoy a smoother and more efficient workday with your Bluetooth keyboard.

It is already stressful enough to get your work done within the specified schedules, so when devices like your mouse or keyboard delay, they compound the problem, and you end up getting less job done.
 
Potential causes for such lags depend on your computer settings, operating system, peripherals in use, and other hardware issues that pass off as keyboard problems. Another cause can be an incompatible device driver.
 
If you want to fix Bluetooth keyboard lag, try some of the solutions listed below and see if it helps.
 
## Why is my Bluetooth keyboard delayed?
 
Slow keyboard response on Windows is a relatively common issue, and it can occur due to your drivers, so make sure you keep them up to date at all times. There is also a Bluetooth keyboard delay test that you can perform.
 
If the keyboard is typing wrong characters, there may be a glitch, and a built-in troubleshooter should be able to fix that.
 
It’s also possible that the mouse or keyboard isn’t detected correctly, and if that happens, you’ll need to check if your device is paired perfectly.
 
#### Do Bluetooth keyboards have a lag?
 
Ideally, Bluetooth keyboards shouldn’t have any, but some cheaper models exhibit lag and latency issues. This is usually due to low-quality hardware and components.
 
If you were to buy a reliable Bluetooth keyboard and keep it within the specified range, there would be minimal or no lag. And minimal lag doesn’t affect the gaming experience.
 
## How do I fix the laggy Bluetooth keyboard in Windows 11?
 
### 1. Update or install drivers
 
#### 1.1 Manually update the drivers
 
- Right-click on the Start button and click on Device Manager.
 - Next, double-click on the Keyboards entry here to expand and view the problematic one.
 - Now, right-click on the lagging keyboard, and select Update driver from the context menu.
 - Select Search automatically for drivers in the window that appears. The Logitech bluetooth keyboard lagging issue will be fixed afterward.

 
Wait for the OS to automatically locate and install the best available driver on the computer, and then verify wireless keyboard lag is gone. If not, you will have to manually find the driver on the manufacturer’s website and then install the latest version. 
 
#### 1.2 Update drivers automatically
 
Updating drivers manually can take a long time, especially if you need to update multiple drivers on your PC. But luckily, there are tools such as DriverFix to help you with that.
 
This software will scan your PC for outdated drivers and allow you to update multiple drivers simultaneously. Also, it will ensure that all your hardware works correctly by keeping all drivers updated.

 - Launch the software.
 - Wait for the detection of all your faulty drivers.

Also, move your computer speakers if they’re in the way, and replace the keyboard batteries to ensure it isn’t causing the lag.
 
Sometimes the issue could be with your computer, such that it causes the entire system to lag, like if it is low on resources like RAM and processor power.
 
This, in turn, led to stuttering and delayed keyboard input, but it doesn’t always mean you have to upgrade the hardware. Instead, you can close unused apps and check if this will fix Bluetooth keyboard lag.
 
### 3. Check the USB connection between your computer and transceiver
 
- Unplug the wireless transceiver and plug it back in.
 - Unplug it and plug it back in if it is plugged into a USB hub.
 - Try connecting the wireless transceiver to another port on the same computer.
 - If you have multiple USB ports, plug the transceiver into a different port on the same computer.
 - If it is plugged into a USB hub, unplug it and then connect it directly to the USB port on the same computer (ensure it is a powered hub appropriate for high-powered USB devices).

 
Did this help? If not, try the next solution.
 
- If you have multiple USB ports, plug the transceiver into a different port on the same computer.
 - If it is plugged into a USB hub, unplug it and then connect it directly to the USB port on the same computer (ensure it is a powered hub appropriate for high-powered USB devices).

 
### 4. Pair your keyboard through SSP without a passkey
 
- Press and hold the Fn key simultaneously as you press and hold the Connect button under the keyboard.
 - After 3 to 5 seconds, a small light on the top of the keyboard will blink green and red alternately. This means that the keyboard is discoverable to your device for six minutes.
 - Press Windows + R to open Run, enter Control Panel in the text field, and click OK.
 - Locate and click on Hardware and Sound.
 - Select Add a device.
 - When the keyboard is listed, select it, and follow the instructions to successfully pair your Wedge Keyboard with your computer.

 
### 5. Resynchronize your keyboard with the receiver
 
- Press the button on the receiver and verify the light on the receiver is blinking. If there’s no button, a dialog box will appear on the screen; follow the instructions.
 - Press and release Connect Channel button below the keyboard.
 - Check if the green light is on – a steady light means the synchronization was successful. If the problem persists, try the steps again, and you should be able to resynchronize the keyboard.

If you find the system taking longer to register keyboard input in Windows 11, run the dedicated troubleshooter and let it try to fix things. If it doesn’t work, you can increase the Repeat rate for the keyboard.
 
For those using an app to modify the keyboard behavior, it too could be responsible for the lag. In this case, the best option is to uninstall the app immediately and verify if there’s any improvement. Also, update the keyboard drivers to the latest available version.
 
### Is it better to have a wired or wireless keyboard?
 
This debate has been going on for a long time and applies to other critical devices, such as the mouse, microphone, or headphones. And the answer is quite simple. 
 
Wired keyboards usually perform better when compared to wireless ones in the same price bracket. And if you are into active gaming, we recommend purchasing a wired keyboard.
 
But for everyday use, the wireless ones are just as good since you wouldn’t generally notice the lag if there’s any. And you have the added advantage of mobility here. So, it’s all up to the end user and their requirements and preferences.
 
That’s all for now! Your Bluetooth keyboard shouldn’t be showing any lags now, and things should work like before.
