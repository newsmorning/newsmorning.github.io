Tech Tragedy: Macbook Pro 13 Loses Vital Pixels in Freak Accident!

As a writer, my Macbook Pro 13 is my loyal companion when it comes to efficiently penning down my words. It’s been a reliable device for the last few years until a freak accident stripped it of vital pixels required for smooth functioning. A day that started with hope and productivity, to say the least, ended with one fatal mistake and a glaring realization.

The day started like any other day. I woke up, had a cup of coffee, logged onto my laptop and started off with my tasks. At some point, I had to wash my hands, and I made a wrong move, which led my Macbook Pro 13 to fall from the ledge - something that was never expected! I was sitting in shock for a minute, wondering if anything had happened to it. The laptop screen miraculously lit up, but as I looked closer, I saw there was a gaping black hole on the screen - it was like it had lost its soul.

The few minutes that followed were full of frustration and desperation as I tried to reboot the laptop and check if the pixels would come back to life. Sadly, rebooting didn’t work. I concluded that my laptop screen had lost a lot of pixels, rendering the text out of resolution in the areas that were affected. This meant that I needed to invest in a new laptop screen, which was not only costly, but it also meant I was not going to be as productive without the Macbook Pro 13.

It was a tragic day. Losing crucial pixels is no laughing matter, and it brought to light the importance of being cautious with valuable items such as laptops, phones, and other technological devices. A momentary lapse in judgment can lead to irreparable damage, which can be very costly in the long run. 

In conclusion, the Macbook Pro 13 is an essential tool, and it has been a reliable companion for many writers such as myself. However, as much as we take care of our devices, accidents still do happen. It’s always wise to invest in keeping our gadgets secure and investing in proper safety measures such as laptop cases and sleeves. We shouldn't wait for a tragedy to happen to take safety measures to avoid it.

## Chosen Solution
 So I broke the bezel along the base of my screen and bought a replacement one. In the process of scraping it off, I think I have applied too much pressure to the little orange connectors into the screen (the one farmost right or possible something else in the vicinity) and seemingly killed vertical lines of pixels in the far right portion of the screen (see attached image).

Is this fixable without an entire screen replacement?

 Ouch! Not good! Sadly you’ve damaged the LCD ribbon cables there is no way to replace them, you’ll need to replace the full display assembly sorry ;-{
