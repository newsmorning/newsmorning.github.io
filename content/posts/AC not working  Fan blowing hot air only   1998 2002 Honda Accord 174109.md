Is Your AC in Your 1998-2002 Honda Accord Only Blowing Hot Air? Here's the Shocking Reason Why - and How to Fix It Fast!

As we head into the hottest months of the year, it can be frustrating to turn on your car's air conditioning only to be met with a rush of hot air. If you drive a 1998-2002 Honda Accord, then you may be all too familiar with this problem. However, the cause of this issue may not be what you expect.

The Shocking Reason for Your AC Trouble

Believe it or not, the most common reason for an AC malfunction in this model of Honda Accord is not a faulty compressor or a refrigerant leak. It's actually a faulty AC clutch relay. This tiny electrical component is responsible for delivering power to the AC compressor, which is what makes the cold air blow. If the relay goes bad, then the compressor won't receive power and the AC will fail.

Thankfully, this is a relatively easy problem to fix. A new AC clutch relay can be purchased for relatively cheap and replacing it can be done with just a few tools.

How to Fix It Fast

First, you'll need to remove the old AC clutch relay. Locate the relay under the hood of your Accord - it's usually on the upper right side of the engine compartment, just behind the headlight. Once you locate it, use pliers to gently pull it out of its socket. Be sure to memorize the relay's position in the socket, that way you won't have to guess about which way to insert the new one.

Next, you'll need to install the new AC clutch relay. Take the new relay and line up the pins with the corresponding holes in the socket. The relay should slide in smoothly - if it doesn't, double check the orientation of both the relay and the socket.

Finally, test your AC to make sure it's working correctly. Turn on the car and let it idle for a few minutes. Then, turn on the AC and check the air output. If everything is working properly, you should feel cold air coming out of the vents. Congratulations! You've fixed your AC problem.

Don't Wait to Fix Your AC

Driving in a hot car with no AC is not only uncomfortable, but it can also be dangerous. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are serious conditions that can occur when your body is exposed to high temperatures for extended periods of time. Don't wait to fix your AC - if you're experiencing this issue in your Honda Accord, be sure to replace the faulty AC clutch relay as soon as possible.

In conclusion, if your 1998-2002 Honda Accord's AC is only blowing hot air, don't panic. The cause is likely a faulty AC clutch relay - an easy problem to fix with just a few tools and a new part. By taking action to fix your AC, you'll ensure a comfortable and safe driving experience all summer long.
