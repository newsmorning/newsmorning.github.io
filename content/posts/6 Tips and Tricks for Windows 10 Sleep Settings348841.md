# You'll Never Believe How These 6 Sleep Settings Tips Will Transform Your Windows 10 Experience!

If you're a Windows 10 user, you probably know that the operating system has a ton of features and customization options. One of these options is the sleep settings for your device, which can greatly impact your user experience.

Today, we're going to share six sleep settings tips that will give you a better overall Windows 10 experience.

## 1. Adjust Your Power Settings

One of the most basic sleep settings you can change is your device's power settings. By default, Windows 10 is set to a Balanced power plan, which balances energy consumption and performance.

However, depending on how you use your device, you may want to change this setting to High performance or Power saver. The former is recommended if you use your device for gaming or heavy multimedia, while the latter will extend your battery life if you're frequently on-the-go.

To adjust your power settings, simply search for "Power & sleep settings" in your Start menu and select "Additional power settings" to get started.

## 2. Change Your Sleep Timer

By default, Windows 10 is set to put your device to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. However, you can adjust this timer to better suit your needs.

To do so, open "Power & sleep settings" again and click on "Additional power settings." Then, select "Change plan settings" next to the power plan you're currently using.

From there, you can adjust how long your device will wait before going to sleep. You can also choose to never have your device go to sleep if you prefer.

## 3. Turn Off Hibernate

Hibernate is a sleep mode that allows your device to save its current state and quickly resume where you left off. However, if you don't use this feature or if you have limited storage, you may want to turn it off.

To do so, open your Command Prompt with administrator privileges and type the following command:

 `powercfg -h off`

This will disable hibernation on your device and reclaim some storage space.

## 4. Keep Your Wi-Fi Connection Active

If you're downloading large files or streaming media, you may not want your Wi-Fi connection to turn off when your device goes to sleep. To disable this feature, open "Device Manager" from your Start menu and find your Wi-Fi adapter.

Right-click on the adapter and select "Properties." Then, go to the "Power Management" tab and uncheck the box that says "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."

## 5. Use Night Mode

Night Mode, also known as Night Light, is a feature in Windows 10 that reduces the amount of blue light emitted by your device's screen. This can help reduce eye strain and improve your sleep quality.

To enable Night Mode, open "Settings" from your Start menu and click on "System." Then, select "Display" and turn on "Night light."

## 6. Customize Your Power Button

Finally, you can customize what happens when you press the power button on your device. By default, pressing the power button will put your device to sleep, but you can change this to shut down or hibernate instead.

To customize your power button, open "Power & sleep settings" again and click on "Additional power settings." Then, select "Choose what the power button does" from the left-hand menu.

From there, you can choose whether to have your device sleep, shut down, or hibernate when you press the power button.

In conclusion, these six sleep settings tips can greatly improve your Windows 10 experience. By adjusting your power settings, changing your sleep timer, disabling hibernate, keeping your Wi-Fi connection active, using Night Mode, and customizing your power button, you can customize your device to better suit your needs. Give them a try and see how they transform your Windows 10 experience!
