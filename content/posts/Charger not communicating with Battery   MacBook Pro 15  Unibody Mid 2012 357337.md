# Is Your MacBook Pro Dying? Charger Not Communicating With Battery Could Be the Culprit!

If you own a MacBook Pro, you know how important it is to keep your battery charged. Not only does the battery keep your laptop running, but it also stores important data and settings. But what happens when you encounter a problem where your charger is not communicating with your battery? The answer is your MacBook Pro could be dying. In this article, we explore this common problem and provide you with helpful tips on how to fix it.

## The Basics of Charger Not Communicating With Battery

Before we get into how to fix this problem, let's start with the basics. A MacBook Pro charger not communicating with the battery means that there is a fault in the communication between the battery and the charger. This could be due to several factors, such as the charger being damaged, a software issue, or a problem with the battery.

## Signs of a MacBook Pro Dying

When your MacBook Pro is dying, you may start to notice some of the following signs:

1. Your MacBook's battery no longer holds a charge.

2. Your MacBook's battery drains quickly, even when not in use.

3. Your MacBook shuts down unexpectedly.

4. Your MacBook's time and date keep changing.

5. Your MacBook is slow or unresponsive.

## How to Fix the Charger Not Communicating With Battery Problem

If you've noticed any of the symptoms listed above, it's time to fix the problem. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Check the charger: The first step is to check whether the charger is working or not. To do this, you can try charging another MacBook Pro with the same charger. If the MacBook Pro charges successfully, then the problem may lie with your battery.

2. Reset the SMC: The next step is to reset the System Management Controller (SMC). The SMC controls the power management, thermal management, and other hardware functions of your MacBook Pro. To reset the SMC, you need to shut down your MacBook, plug in the charger, and press the Shift + Control + Option + Power buttons simultaneously. Release all buttons and turn on your MacBook.

3. Check the battery: If resetting the SMC does not solve the problem, you may need to check your MacBook's battery. You can do this by shutting down your MacBook, unplugging the charger, and removing the battery. Clean the battery and reinsert it. Turn on your MacBook and check if the problem is resolved.

4. Update your software: If the problem still persists, you may need to update your software. To do this, go to the Apple menu, click on Software Update, and follow the instructions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a MacBook Pro charger not communicating with the battery could be the reason why your MacBook Pro is dying. Follow the steps outlined in this article to troubleshoot and fix the problem. Remember, it's always important to keep your MacBook Pro charged and well-maintained to avoid unexpected shutdowns and data loss.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a mid 2012 unibody MBP with some odd power issues.
It started when one of my chargers stopped working and I started noticing that the battery indicator would show an unusual amount of charge left such as %30 when I knew it should have close to %100, or the other way around. Then it began having red battery icons, and the laptop would intermittently just go into sleep or shut down completely when I would unplug my charger.
I did an SMC reset and it seemed to help for a bit, but would start up within a week or two and eventually got to the point where the SMC reset wouldn't do anything and being able to get my laptop running solely on battery power (being able to wake it after unplugging, or having it just startup on its own when opened) was pretty rare. Finally the battery icon disappeared completely. I tried getting it back in system preferences and it will show up as charging for a second then disappear right away and uncheck the box. When checking my battery it seemed to indicate it was fine, but it was a little high on charges and I figured I'd try a battery swap to see if that would fix it.
I swapped the battery and Coconut is essentially seeming to say it's not there. Manufactured in 1979, power adapter connected, but then saying not connected in battery info, no charge capacity, etc. Similar to when the previous battery was connected, when i try to do an SMC reset nothing seems to happen, magsafe adapter just stays a solid green (no matter what charger I use), battery icon never appears. I know it seems like the I/O but it seems strange as with the old battery it would still occasionally wake up with just the battery.

 Lets do this pop the bottom cover off and disconnect the battery charger ribbon cable. Did that fix things?
