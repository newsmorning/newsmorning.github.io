# You'll Never Believe How Dirty Your Nissan Altima Cabin Air Filter is Until You See This Step-by-Step Replacement Guide!

If you're a Nissan Altima owner, you may not realize just how dirty your cabin air filter can get over time. The cabin air filter is designed to filter out dust, dirt, and other pollutants that can harm your health and affect your vehicle's performance. Over time, however, this filter can become clogged with debris, reducing its effectiveness and causing your car to smell bad. In this guide, we'll walk you through replacing your Nissan Altima's cabin air filter step-by-step, so you can breathe easier and enjoy a fresher-smelling car.

## Step 1: Locate the Cabin Air Filter

The cabin air filter on a Nissan Altima is located behind the glove box. To access it, you'll need to remove the glove box by opening it and pressing the tabs on each side inward. Once the tabs are pressed, the glove box will release from the dashboard and come out.

## Step 2: Remove the Old Cabin Air Filter

Once you've removed the glove box, you'll see the cabin air filter housing. It's a black plastic box that's held in place by two clips. These clips can be tricky to remove, but you can use a flathead screwdriver or other tool to gently pry them loose. Once the clips are off, you can remove the cabin air filter from the housing.

## Step 3: Clean the Housing

Before you install the new cabin air filter, take a moment to clean the housing. Use a damp cloth or a vacuum cleaner to remove any dust or debris that may have accumulated inside. This will help ensure that your new filter works effectively.

## Step 4: Install the New Cabin Air Filter

Now it's time to install the new cabin air filter. Make sure the filter fits snugly into the housing, and that the air flow arrow is pointing in the right direction. Once the filter is properly positioned, reattach the clips to secure the housing in place.

## Step 5: Reinstall the Glove Box

With the new cabin air filter installed, you can now put the glove box back in place. Simply reverse the steps you used to remove it, pressing the tabs inward until it snaps back into position.

## Step 6: Enjoy the Benefits of Clean Air

Congratulations! You've successfully replaced your Nissan Altima's cabin air filter. You'll now enjoy better air quality and fresher-smelling air in your car. We recommend replacing your cabin air filter every 12,000 to 15,000 miles, or at least once a year, to ensure optimal performance. With this simple maintenance task, you can prolong the life of your HVAC system and improve your driving experience.

So you can do this without removing the glove box, bit of a pain but much easier. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z5HufXU...
 
While removing h glove box might give you better access and enable you to seat the filter betterI would do the faster mehod.
