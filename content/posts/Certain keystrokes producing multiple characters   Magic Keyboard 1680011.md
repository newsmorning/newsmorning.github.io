# Unbelievable! How Certain Keystrokes on the Magic Keyboard Can Produce Multiple Characters - You Won't Believe Your Eyes!

Have you ever found yourself typing furiously on your Magic Keyboard, only to realize that somehow, inexplicably, multiple characters have appeared on your screen? It's a frustrating experience, to be sure, but it's not as random as it might seem. In fact, there are a number of keystrokes you can use to produce multiple characters, and once you master them, you'll be typing faster and more efficiently than ever before.

But first, a caveat: not all keyboards are created equal. While the Magic Keyboard (or any other Apple keyboard) is designed to recognize certain keystrokes, other keyboards may not be as receptive. If you're not having luck with your current setup, it may be time to invest in a better keyboard.

That said, let's get into the nitty-gritty of multiple keystrokes. One of the most common things you'll encounter is the ability to produce accents on certain letters. For example, if you're typing in French, you might need to produce the letter é. On a Mac, you can do this by holding down the Option key while typing an e, and then typing another e. Voila! You've got yourself an é.

Similarly, you can produce other accents by holding down the Option key and typing other letters. For example, Option + i produces ï, while Option + u followed by a vowel produces an umlaut (e.g. ü).

But what about other types of characters? The Magic Keyboard also recognizes a number of keystrokes that are particularly useful for typing math equations or other symbols. For example, Option + 8 produces a degree symbol (°), while Option + K followed by a number produces a superscript (e.g. K2). Option + / produces a division sign (÷), while Option + Shift + 2 produces a trademark symbol (™).

And those are just a few of the different keystrokes you can use to produce multiple characters on your Magic Keyboard. Once you start to get the hang of them, you'll find that your typing becomes faster, more efficient, and more accurate - not to mention more impressive to anyone watching over your shoulder.

But here's the thing: while it may seem like a magical skill to produce multiple characters with just a few keystrokes, it's really just a matter of knowing the right combinations. With a little bit of practice and patience, anyone can master this skill - and you'll be amazed at how much it improves your typing abilities.

So go ahead, give it a try. Type out a few different characters and symbols, see what works and what doesn't, and soon enough you'll be a Magic Keyboard pro. And who knows - maybe you'll even impress yourself with how fast and efficient you can type!

## Chosen Solution
 My keyboard has started malfunctioning where every time I press certain keys, I get two characters instead of the single character it ought to be. Here are the character sets being affected
56
-/
ty
=[
gh
bn
For example, when I press '5', it produces '56', and the same when I press '6'. It too produces '56'. Same for the whole list above.
Note too the apparent pattern down the keyboard with the '56', 'ty', 'gh', and 'bn' combos.
I've checked battery level. It's nearly full charge. I've tried using while plugged in and charging. I've tried gently lifting affected keys and blowing out any possible dust, particles, etc. None of this has helped.

 I solved this by removing the keys and cleaning underneath them with windex-like house cleaner. Some of the keys had sticky residue which did not get removed by compressed air.
Also, some keys were influenced by stickiness under OTHER keys.

 Have you checked your keyboard settings to see if there is a replacement set for those keys? It seems strange that both 5 and 6 will change to 56. Some people will add replacements like this as a prank, so check in the "Text" tab of the "Keyboard" section of system preferences.
Also, have you tried the keyboard on another device, and if so, did the problem persist?
