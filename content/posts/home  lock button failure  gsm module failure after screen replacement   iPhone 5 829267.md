Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Fix My iPhone 5 Screen!

Intro: We all know the pain of a cracked iPhone screen. After weeks of suffering, I decided to take matters into my own hands and fix my phone screen myself. What happened next was beyond my imagination.

Section 1: The pre-fixing excitement 
As soon as I decided to fix my iPhone screen myself, I immediately started looking for step-by-step tutorials online. I was amazed by all the DIY videos and confident that I could do it too.

Section 2: The initial progress 
I ordered a screen replacement kit and started working on my phone. Things were going smoothly, and I couldn't believe how easy it was. I was proud of myself for saving money and fixing it on my own.

Section 3: The unexpected crash 
Suddenly, while I was halfway through replacing the screen, my iPhone crashed. It would not turn on no matter what I tried. I was devastated and had no clue what went wrong.

Section 4: The Apple store visit 
I took my broken iPhone to the Apple store, hoping they could fix it. However, the tech specialist there gave me the bad news: I had short-circuited my phone's logic board, which basically meant that my phone was beyond repair.

Section 5: The moral of the story 
I learned the hard way that fixing an iPhone screen is not as easy as it looks. It requires delicate handling and proper knowledge of what you're doing. There is no shame in seeking professional help or just replacing the phone altogether.

Conclusion: While the thrill of DIY may seem tempting, it's essential to consider whether it's worth the risk of ending up with irreparable damage. Unless you're an expert in fixing iPhones or have experience doing such repairs, it's best to leave it to the professionals to avoid any mishaps like mine.

## Chosen Solution
 hi!
i replaced the screen of my iphone 5 and did it really gently, so i didn't damage anything inside. But after the replacement the home, lock buttons stopped working and also there was no gsm signal. telephone is constantly in recovery mode, but it is possible to bring it from this mode using tinyumbrella, for example. i brought my phone to the best repairment center in town and after 2 days of inspection they said that they couldn't help. they didn't find any damage inside, they tried to change all buttons new screen but it didn't work either. telephone doesn't work also with old cracked screen, but it worked before i changed it. So i would be glad if someone help me, or give me a contact of a person who knows how to fox the phone :)

 Pry damage to the motherboard from prying battery..
Look under the long black interconnect cables just opposite sim tray there will he missing components

 Hi Sergei,
This is classic pry damage from prying the battery on the logic board side, I see it every day.
I fix mail in iPhone 5 pry damage constantly, including International phones.  We can restore your home and power button function, guaranteed.
I'm worried about your searching no signal problem though.  Look very closely at the glass chip located on the edge of the board just under the SIM tray---if there is a slight crack or chip on this chip caused by a slipped screwdriver on the nearby screw hole, then this could be the source of your searching no signal--I've seen that twice.
First, however, rule out common causes of searching no signal like date/time problem.
I will post a link to my pry damage repair service so that you can inspect your phone to see if it matches the damage in the pictures.
