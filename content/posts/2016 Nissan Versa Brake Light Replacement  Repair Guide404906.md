# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Replace Your Nissan Versa Brake Light in Just a Few Simple Steps - 2016 Repair Guide Inside!

Routine maintenance is an essential part of car ownership, and one of the most important aspects of vehicle maintenance is replacing faulty parts before they can cause major issues. One of the most common maintenance tasks is replacing a brake light, which is a quick and easy process that can be easily accomplished by most car owners. Here is a simplified guide on how to replace the brake light on a Nissan Versa.

## Step 1: Gather the necessary tools

Before starting the replacement process, you will need to gather a few essential tools. These tools include a Phillips head screwdriver, a pair of latex gloves, a new brake light bulb (Model 7443), and a clean cloth.

## Step 2: Access the light

Next, locate the brake light housing on the rear of your Nissan Versa. It will be located on the rear quarter panel, next to the red taillight. Once located, use your Phillips head screwdriver to remove the two screws that are holding the brake light housing in place.

## Step 3: Remove the old bulb

Once the brake light housing is removed, take a close look at the bulb that is in place to ensure that it is burned out or simply damaged. Once damaged, put on your latex gloves and gently twist and pull the old bulb out of the socket in the brake light.

## Step 4: Install the new bulb

Take the new bulb and carefully insert it into the empty socket, being careful not to touch the bulb with your skin as oils from your skin can shorten a bulb’s lifespan. Once the new bulb is fully inserted and secured into the socket, power on your vehicle to confirm that the new bulb is functioning correctly.

## Step 5: Reassemble the brake light

After confirming that the new brake light works, reattach the brake light housing back into place and screw it in using the Phillips head screwdriver. You can then test the brake light once more to ensure it functions correctly.

Replacing the brake light on a Nissan Versa is a simple process that can be completed with minimal tools and time. It’s essential to keep the brake lights in excellent working condition as it could help to prevent accidents on the road.

In summary, car maintenance does not have to be complicated, and tasks like replacing brake lights can be quite simple. By following the steps outlined above, you can rest assured that your Nissan Versa's brake light replacement process will be easy and straightforward. So be safe, replace your brake lights as soon as possible, and stay on the road accident-free.
