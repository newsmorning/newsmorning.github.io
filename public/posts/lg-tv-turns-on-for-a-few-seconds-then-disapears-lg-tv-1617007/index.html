This issue can occur for several reasons, ranging from simple to complex. Fortunately, many of the solutions are quite easy to implement.\nHere are some reasons why your LG TV might disappear after a few seconds, and what you can do to fix it.\nProblem with Remote Control One of the most common causes of an LG TV disappearing after a few seconds is a problem with the remote control. Sometimes, the remote might not be able to communicate with the TV, causing it to turn off. This is especially common if the remote is old or has low batteries.\nIf you suspect that the remote is the problem, replace the batteries or try using a different remote control. If the problem persists, check if there is anything blocking the TV’s sensor or if there are any obstructions between the remote and the TV.\nIssues with Power Supply Another common cause of an LG TV disappearing after a few seconds is a problem with the power supply. If your TV is not getting enough power, it might turn off spontaneously. This can happen if there is a problem with the power cord or the power outlet you are using.\nTo fix this problem, try replacing the power cord or using a different outlet. If this doesn’t work, seek professional help to examine the TV’s power supply.\nNetwork Connection Problems LG TVs have built-in support for various online services, including streaming platforms and social media apps. Sometimes, if there is a problem with your internet connection or LG TV’s firmware, the TV might turn off unexpectedly.\nTo fix this issue, try resetting your internet connection or updating your TV’s firmware. If the problem persists, contact LG customer support.\nOverheating If your LG TV is overheating, it might shut down to prevent damage to the internal components. Overheating can occur due to various reasons, such as a malfunctioning cooling fan, improper ventilation, or dust buildup inside the TV.\nTo fix this problem, ensure that your TV is well ventilated and free from dust. You should also check if the cooling fan is working properly. If your LG TV is still overheating, contact a professional technician to check if there are any hardware issues.\nConclusion In conclusion, if your LG TV is disappearing after a few seconds, it can be quite frustrating. However, many of the reasons behind this issue are easy to fix. By troubleshooting the TV’s remote control, power supply, network connection, and overheating issues, you can easily diagnose and solve the problem. If none of these solutions work, consider contacting a certified technician to examine the TV and suggest further solutions.\nChosen Solution Hi, My LG TV will turn on for a few seconds then the image will go black but audio will continue. Can anyone suggest here to begin trouble shooting? Already tried unplugging for a period and plugging back in \u0026 changing the input source neither of which worked.\nHi, What is the model number of the TV? If it is a LED TV turn on the TV and then use a torch and shine it at an angle close to the screen to see if you can detect any images at all when the screen is black and there is audio. The images will be very faint if they are there so trying this in a darkened room may help to see it. If there are images then you have a backlight problem. This could be the power board (or maybe an inverter board) the LED strips themselves or maybe a problem with the mainboard telling the power board to turn the backlights off.\n","wordCount":"665","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vernon Connor"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/lg-tv-turns-on-for-a-few-seconds-then-disapears-lg-tv-1617007/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your LG TV Playing Tricks on You?
