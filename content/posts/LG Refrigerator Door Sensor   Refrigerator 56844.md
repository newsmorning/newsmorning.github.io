## Chosen Solution
 I have an LG refrigerator that started beeping as if door was open when it was not.  Tried replacing door sensors and that didn’t work.   Repair guy came out and said I needed a new control board.  Came back today and put new board in but said that did not fix it.  While talking to him I noticed that a wire was broken where the door connect to the sensors.  He reconnected that and it worked, but said the broken wire ruined the control board so I still needed the new control board.  That seems fishy to me.  Does that make sense that a broken wire to a door sensor would ruin the control board?

 Hi @jgshively ,
Did the broken sensor wire, one end of which was presumably still connected to the control board (other end connected to sensor) have a bared end at the break i.e. insulation pared back so wire was exposed?
If so and the bared end was touching the frame (earth connection) it may have damaged the control board components that it was connected to due to excess current flowing through them, rather than the normally reduced current flow that passes through the sensor to the control board.
If not and if you still have the old control board you could try swapping the boards back and check if the old board still works OK. That will let you know. Make sure that all the refrigerator functions work i.e. cooling (refrigerator and freezer), defrosting, ice maker (if applicable) etc, so you may have to let it run for a few days to be sure.
