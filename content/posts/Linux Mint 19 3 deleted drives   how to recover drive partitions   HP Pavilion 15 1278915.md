You Won't Believe What Happened When Linux Mint 19.3 Deleted These 3 Drives on HP Pavilion 15 - Learn How to Recover Your Data Now!

Have you ever encountered data loss on Linux Mint 19.3? Well, you are not alone. In reality, data loss is a common issue that many computer users face, and not even Linux Mint systems are immune from it. In this article, we will share a story of one Linux Mint user who inadvertently deleted three drives on their HP Pavilion 15 and how they recovered their data.

The background story

One day, a Linux Mint user was attempting to resize an existing partition using GParted. Unfortunately, while performing the operation, he mistakenly deleted three partitions that contained crucial data. The three partitions that got deleted were sdb1, sdc1, and sdc2, and they held essential files like music, videos, photos, and documents.

To make things worse, the affected partitions were not backed up, and the user had no idea how to recover the data. The user tried all sorts of data recovery tools and techniques but found no success. However, all was not lost as we will explain below.

How to recover deleted data on Linux Mint 19.3

If you ever find yourself in a data loss situation on Linux Mint 19.3, don't fret as you can recover your data using several methods. The following are some of the best ways to recover deleted data on your Linux Mint system.

1. Data recovery software

One of the quickest ways to recover deleted data on Linux Mint 19.3 is to use data recovery software. There are plenty of powerful data recovery tools available online that can help you retrieve lost data, such as TestDisk, PhotoRec, and Disk Drill.

These tools are free to download, and they support various file systems like ext4, NTFS, FAT32, etc. They can also recover a wide range of file types like documents, images, videos, music, and archives. However, keep in mind that the longer you wait to attempt recovery, the less likely you are to recover any files, so act quickly.

2. Recover from backups

If you have been consistently backing up your files, you are in luck. Recovering data from backups is probably the easiest way to recover lost files on Linux Mint systems. With backup files, it is possible to roll back the changes made on your system, and thus revert to a previous state where the files were still present.

3. Professional data recovery services

In some cases, data recovery services from experts may be needed to recover data. Professionals have advanced tools, techniques, and years of experience to handle complex data loss scenarios. These services are usually a bit costly, but you may want to consider them if your files are of critical importance.

Back to our story

In the end, our Linux Mint user was able to recover all the lost data using PhotoRec. The software scanned the hard drive and retrieved all the lost files in their original format. Fortunately, the user had not overwritten any of the deleted data when attempting to recover the information. Hence, the risk of losing the data forever was relatively low.

The lesson learned here is that data loss can happen to anyone, and it's better to be safe than sorry. Always keep backups of your important files and avoid risky operations like drive deletions unless you know what you're doing.

In conclusion

In a nutshell, losing data on your Linux Mint 19.3 system can be a frustrating experience, but all hope is not lost. Your data can still be recovered using various methods like data recovery software, backups, or professional data recovery services. Make sure to act quickly and avoid data loss risks whenever possible. Remember, prevention is better than cure.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I had Windows 7 partitioned with four drivers but decided to replace it with Linux Mint 19.3. I made a mistake of erasing all the data as I assumed the new OS will only format drive C and leave the other drives intact. I am now le ft with Linux with no access to all my data with no backup. The question I have is whether I could recover any of my data (400 to 600 GB) with a data recovery software.

 Hi Mona Lisa,
Answer part 1 for now
Recovery is certainly quite possible.
First of all I must tell you I know Windows very well but have not done extensive work with Linux.  Ideally to help you it would be good if you have access to another Windows computer.
Do you remember what drive format you used for Linux?  Linux's default file system is called Ext4. Windows uses NTFS or FAT 32.
I know this doesn't help you now but ALWAYS back up data before doing anything you are not familiar with - never mind that  just always back up important data.
If you have another Windows computer normal data recovery procedure is , as you have done, don't do anything or as little as possible.
Sector by sector cloning:
Take the drive out of the laptop ( we need your exact HP Pavilion 15 model number if you don't know how to remove the drive)Get a USB to SATA converter cable - get two if the other computer is not a desktop model.Get a SATA HD/SSD drive to back up your current data.Get freeware cloning software that does a sector by sector clone.  This is very important as you want a complete copy at the most basic level.  AOMEI Backupper Standard free does this.  It is free and the trade-off is it is slow.  If you want speed buy the pro version.  There are others. Take your pick.Once the drive is copied  put it aside and use the copy to recover your data.
Data recovery:
#  Now that you have a backup you if you make a mistake can relax and just do a sector by sector clone again.
Anything over written by Linux files is probably lost other wise it is most likely just sitting on the hard drive. You just can't see it at present.I wasn't there so did not see what you actually did. For the !&&* of it see if your Windows machines sees any of you data. Yes then you are laughing if not then we will get on with it. I never assume anything when attempting to recover data.You will need data recovery software.  Test Disk is the best freeware partition recovery software, that I know of and use. I also use Active@ Boot Disk (and others) for my professional work but again that is your choice and cost money. Test Disk requires reading the manual to become some what familiar with how it works and what is does.  It can:
TestDisk can (from their web site):
Fix partition table, recover deleted partitionRecover FAT32 boot sector from its backupRebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sectorFix FAT tablesRebuild NTFS boot sectorRecover NTFS boot sector from its backupFix MFT using MFT mirrorLocate ext2/ext3/ext4 Backup SuperBlockUndelete files from FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2 filesystemCopy files from deleted FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3/ext4 partitions.
Again, it all depends on what NTFS or FAT32 files were overwritten by Linux files.
So I'll let you go at this point. Let me know what you decide to do and chat with me again.  We may be able to find work arounds if you don't access to another Windows computer, etc.

 Hi Mike,
Thanks so much for your reply to my question and your detailed answer. Ifixit website would not let me add a long text at once so I broke it down in four sections. It might be easier to see the whole text here https://forums.tomsguide.com/threads/lin...
I am not in a huge rush to try the data recovery process as I want to make sure I make as little mistake as possible. I'll follow the process detailed in your reply but I thought there were no harm adding additional notes.
Many thanks
PMS
