Introduction

Have you ever found yourself with an old tablet that's sitting around collecting dust? Maybe you upgraded to a newer device, or the tablet is simply outdated and you don't use it anymore. But before you decide to throw it away, consider installing Windows on it and giving it a new lease on life! In this article, we'll guide you through the steps of installing Windows on an HP Elitepad 900 tablet, and show you how to revive your old device.

Step 1: Prepare the USB Drive

The first step in installing Windows on your HP Elitepad 900 is to create a bootable USB drive. You'll need a USB drive with at least 8GB of space, and the Windows installation media. You can download the Windows installation media from Microsoft's website, or if you have a copy of Windows on a disc, you can use that instead.

To create a bootable USB drive, insert the USB drive into your computer and open the Windows installation media. Follow the instructions to create a bootable USB drive, and then eject the USB drive when it's complete.

Step 2: Change the Boot Settings

Next, you'll need to change the boot settings on your HP Elitepad 900. Start by turning off the device, then press and hold the power button and the Windows button at the same time. This will open the startup menu. Use the arrow keys to select Boot Options, then press Enter.

In the Boot Options menu, change the boot order so that the USB drive is the first device to boot from. Save your changes and exit the menu.

Step 3: Install Windows

Now that your HP Elitepad 900 is set up to boot from the USB drive, you can install Windows. Insert the USB drive into the device, and then turn it on. The Windows installation process will begin automatically.

Follow the instructions on the screen to install Windows on your HP Elitepad 900. You'll need to enter your product key to activate Windows, so make sure you have that information handy.

Once Windows is installed, your HP Elitepad 900 will restart. You can now use your tablet just like any other Windows device.

Conclusion

Installing Windows on your HP Elitepad 900 is a great way to revive an old device that you thought was no longer useful. With a few simple steps, you can turn your tablet into a fully functioning Windows device and get some more use out of it. Don't throw away your old tablet - give it a second chance with Windows!

## Chosen Solution
 i need install windows for my tablet
plz help to reinstall windows

 Make the Following 4 Preparations before Reinstalling Windows.
1.Prepare Windows Installation Disc
You can install Windows from either Windows installation CD/DVD or USB flash drive. If you have such a disk, skip to the second step. If there is no such disk, create one by burning your Windows ISO file to optical disc or USB flash drive, and both Windows built-in burner and third party program can help do this.
2.Backup All Needed Data Saved on Boot Partition or System Disk
Reinstalling will result in data loss no matter you delete the original partition or not. Therefore, when the partition is storing useful files, please backup or transfer these files out in advance. The fastest way to create a backup for all important files is copying the disk , you may use third-party software like MiniTool Partition Wizard to make things easy.
3.Delete Windows Boot Partition or Clean System Disk
If you just plan to reinstall Windows without deleting the boot partition, ignore this step, but I highly suggest deleting the boot partition and then reinstalling Windows since the latter gives better experience.
4. Remove All Non-essential Peripherals
You’d better remove all peripherals that are not required to reinstall Windows, such as card reader, earphone, and removable hard disk. With these devices connected, you may receive error message.
