When it comes to digital photography, we all love to capture every moment and store our precious memories on our devices. As time passes, our collection of photos grows, and managing them can become quite a task. If you own an Acer Icona One 10 Tablet, moving your photos to free up space or organize them can be easy and quick. Let's dive into how to move pictures on your Acer Icona One 10 Tablet.

## Step 1: Finding Your Photos 

The first step in moving your pictures is to find them! On your Acer Icona One 10 Tablet, the most common way to view your pictures is by opening the Photos app. This app should be pre-installed, and you can access it from the home screen or app drawer. Once you open the Photos app, you'll be able to see all of your saved folders, which are usually named by date or categories, such as Camera or Screenshots. 

## Step 2: Selecting the Photos 

Selecting the photos you want to move is an essential step. You can choose one or many pictures at once by tapping on them. When you select a photo, it will be highlighted, and you'll see a checkmark. To select multiple photos, tap on each photo you want to move. If you want to select all the pictures in a particular folder, tap and hold on any photo in the folder, and the option to select All will appear. 

## Step 3: Moving the Photos 

Once you have selected the pictures you want to move, you can move them to a new folder or an already saved one. If you want to move your photos to a new folder, click the plus (+) icon in the top right corner of the screen. This will give you the option to create a new folder with the title of your choice. After you've named your new folder, tap on Move To to move your selected photos to your new folder.

If you want to move your pictures to an already created folder, tap and hold on any selected photo, and select Move To. This will show you all of your available folders. Select the folder you want to move your photos to, and they will be moved.

## Step 4: Check Your Photos 

Lastly, after you've moved your photos, it's crucial to make sure they are in the correct place. You can do this by navigating back to the Photos App and checking the folder you moved the photos to. The pictures should be relocated in the new or already saved folder, and you'll notice that they are no longer visible in the old folder.

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, moving pictures on your Acer Icona One 10 Tablet is a simple and easy process. Following these four simple steps can help you free up space or organize your photos quickly without any frustration. This step-by-step guide can help you revolutionize your photo storage game and make the management of your photos much more accessible.
