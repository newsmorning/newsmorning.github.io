If you are experiencing frequent crashes and sluggishness, then it might be due to high CPU usage. As we all know, CPU acts as the brain of the computer, which processes all our commands and runs the applications we use. Therefore, it’s essential to fix high CPU usage to ensure smooth computing.\nThankfully, you don’t have to be a tech expert to solve high CPU usage issues. With a little knowledge and effort, you can quickly fix this problem on your MacOS device. Here are the five genius methods you can follow to fix high CPU usage on your MacOS device:\nIdentify and quit the culprit applications The first step in fixing high CPU usage is identifying the applications or processes that are consuming most of the CPU resources. You can use the Activity Monitor to track the applications that are using the most CPU resources. Once identified, you can quit these applications to free up CPU resources.\nDisable unnecessary startup items Having too many applications launching at startup can also cause high CPU usage. To disable unnecessary startup items, go to System Preferences \u003e Users \u0026 Groups \u003e Login Items. From here, you can uncheck the applications that you don’t need at startup.\nPrevent Dashboard from using too many resources The macOS Dashboard can cause high CPU usage if it’s configured to update too frequently. To fix this problem, open the Terminal app and enter the following command: defaults write com.apple.dashboard MCXDashboardDisabled -boolean YES. This command will disable the Dashboard and prevent it from using too many resources.\nUpdate macOS and system software High CPU usage can also be caused by outdated operating system and system software. To check for available updates, go to the App Store and click on the Updates tab. If updates are available, download and install them to optimize system performance.\nReset SMC and PRAM/NVRAM Resetting SMC (System Management Controller) and PRAM/NVRAM can help fix high CPU usage issues. To reset SMC, shut down your Mac, unplug it and hold the power button for 15 seconds. For resetting PRAM/NVRAM, restart your Mac and press Command + Option + P + R keys simultaneously until the Mac startup sound is heard twice.\nIn conclusion, high CPU usage is one of the most common reasons for MacOS slowdowns.
