The BLU Life XL is a budget smartphone created by BLU Products, an American company that specializes in producing affordable Android devices. However, this budget phone has been causing a lot of confusion and panic among its users lately. BLU Life XL owners have reported that the charging light remains on even when the phone is completely dead.

This shocking revelation has left many BLU Life XL users frustrated, confused, and even convinced that their phone has stopped working permanently. Some have gone as far as complaining to the company, while others have taken the initiative to conduct their investigations and seek out solutions for this perplexing issue.

The charging light is there to indicate that the phone is charging when connected to a power source. However, it's completely normal for the charging light to turn off when the battery is full. In the case of the BLU Life XL, the light appears to stay on even when the battery is drained, which has resulted in major uncertainty and confusion.

But the million-dollar question remains – why does the charging light stay on even if the battery is dead? The answer is quite simple. The BLU Life XL has a firmware issue that causes the charging light to remain on even when the battery is completely drained.

This issue has been present since the BLU Life XL was first released in 2016, and the company is still struggling to fix it. However, the good news is that it has been confirmed that the phone isn't completely dead and that this issue can be easily solved.

All you need to do when the charging light stays on while the phone is dead is to press and hold the power button for around 20 seconds. Doing so will trigger a reboot process, enabling the phone to power up and function correctly again.

In conclusion, the BLU Life XL charging light staying on while the phone is dead may seem shocking and frightening, but it's nothing to fret about. The issue seems to be a firmware malfunction that can be fixed in a matter of seconds. So, if you're a BLU Life XL user and have encountered this problem, simply press and hold the power button for 20 seconds, and your phone will come back to life.

## Chosen Solution
 My BLU phone hasn’t been responsive all day, was working fine last night, put it to charge before I went to bed, woke up this morning, when I unplugged it, the blue charging light was still on, and the screen was dim. Can not reset it, phone is unresponsive.

 In my experience when I met similar problem in samsung device I changed the lcd and worked fine. When I me this issue in Motorola device it was motherboard issue. Good luck with this device
