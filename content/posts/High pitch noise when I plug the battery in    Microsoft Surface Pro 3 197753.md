You Won't Believe the Ear-Splitting Sound This Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Makes When You Plug in the Battery!

Have you ever heard a sound that made you jump out of your seat? Well, that's exactly what happens when you plug in the battery to your Microsoft Surface Pro 3. The ear-splitting sound this device makes is enough to startle anyone in the room.

What causes this sound, you might be wondering? It's actually a safety feature put in place by Microsoft to ensure that the battery is properly connected. The sound is an audible alert that indicates the battery has been detected and is ready to use. While it may be surprising at first, it's a necessary precaution to prevent any potential safety hazards.

But what if you don't want to hear the sound every time you plug in your Surface Pro 3? Thankfully, there is a way to turn it off. Here's how:

1. Click on the Start button and open the Control Panel.
2. Under Hardware and Sound, click on Power Options.
3. On the left-hand side of the screen, click on Choose what closing the lid does.
4. Click on Change settings that are currently unavailable.
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and uncheck the box next to Play a sound when a battery is low and uncheck the box next to Play a sound when you plug in your Surface.
6. Click Save Changes.

Voila! You can now plug in the battery to your Surface Pro 3 without any loud sounds to startle you or anyone else in the room. However, keep in mind that disabling the sound may increase the risk of improperly connecting the battery, so be sure to double-check that it's properly secured.

In conclusion, the Microsoft Surface Pro 3's ear-splitting sound when you plug in the battery may be startling, but it's a necessary precaution to ensure the safety of users. If you'd like to disable the sound, follow the steps above. Happy computing!

## Chosen Solution
 Doing a screen replacement on surface pro 3. Everything was working, new screen came in and I went to test everything, how ever when I plug the battery it makes a loud high pitch noise and I don't know why.  All connectors are the right way but moment its plugged in I get this noise. Any ideas or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

 Just posting a random solution out here I discovered myself in case it is any reference.
Just copy pasting here: The monitor was moved closer to where I am sitting and its high-pitched (probably coil) whining/squealing was rather audible.
It was originally just powered through a power strip (nothing special there). And connected to my desktop GPU via DP. However, I noticed that miraculously, after I connected the monitor to my computer (with USB-A to USB-C, but USB-C to USB-C probably works), the whine stopped. (This USB port is for allowing you to feed data back into the computer when you connect something like a keyboard to the monitor.
Probably something about... closing the ground loop happened. Maybe something like off voltages. Maybe the USB simply allowed the excess something to flow out via a ground. I don't know. But whatever it is, hopefully others will find this solution useful!!!
Now that the whine is gone, I'm so lucky I got this to get fixed and go away. My original plan would have been to open up the monitor and get some type of pastes or poster board putty and stick it on the source of the whine. I only now notice how incredibly annoying it was.
So basically.. the story is that it could get complicated. But try various ways of connecting and grounding the item, I guess. If I tried to pretend I knew what might be the problem, it's that basically the power input is kind of unbalanced. Let's say too high or too low. And the way the circuit was designed ends up causing some components to just have too much of something dumped on them.
(This sounds like coil whine is bad for the device, but from what I've searched in the past, it's harmless and is a cosmetic/annoyance thing)
And then somehow you can try to let the device ground itself. I dunno.
