Is Your Alcatel One Touch Pop Mega Stuck on the Android Screen? Here’s How to Break Free!

If your Alcatel One Touch Pop Mega is stuck on the Android screen and you cannot use it, you are not alone. This is a common problem that many Android users face. The good news is that there are several ways to fix this issue, and we are here to guide you through them. 

First, try a soft reset by removing the battery if it is removable, and then replace it and turn on the phone. If this does not work, try a hard reset by following these steps:

1. Press and hold the power button and the volume up button until you see the Android logo.

2. When the Android logo appears, release the power button but continue to hold the volume up button.

3. Use the volume buttons to navigate to "wipe data/factory reset" and press the power button to select it.

4. Use the volume buttons to scroll down to "Yes – delete all user data" and press the power button to select it.

5. Once the reset is complete, select "reboot system now" using the power button.

If these steps do not work, try unlocking the bootloader and installing a new custom ROM on your device. This is a more complex solution, so be sure to follow all instructions carefully. 

To begin, download the Android SDK platform tools and extract them to a folder on your computer. Then, enable USB debugging on your device by going to Settings > Developer Options. If you cannot find Developer Options, go to About Phone and tap on Build Number until it says Developer Options are enabled. 

Next, turn off your device and connect it to your computer via USB. Open the platform tools folder and hold the shift key while right-clicking on an empty space to open a command prompt window. Type "adb reboot bootloader" and press enter to boot the device into the bootloader. 

Once in the bootloader, type "fastboot oem unlock" and press enter to unlock the bootloader. This will erase all data on your device, so be sure to backup everything important beforehand. 

Now that you have an unlocked bootloader, you can install a custom ROM. Search online for a ROM that is compatible with your device and download it. Next, type "fastboot flash recovery recovery.img" and press enter to install a custom recovery on your device. 

Finally, boot into recovery mode by turning off your device and pressing and holding the power button and volume up button until you see the recovery menu. Use the volume buttons to navigate to "install from zip" and press the power button to select it. Select the custom ROM that you downloaded earlier and wait for the installation process to complete. Once done, select "reboot system now" using the power button to boot into your new ROM. 

In conclusion, if your Alcatel One Touch Pop Mega is stuck on the Android screen, there are several ways to fix it. Starting off with the simple solutions like a soft reset or a hard reset is a good first step. If these don't work, you can try unlocking the bootloader and installing a new custom ROM. Make sure you follow all instructions carefully and backup your data before attempting any solution. With these steps, you should be able to break free from the Android screen and get back to using your device in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 When I woke up this morning my phone was on the charger and already stuck on the android screen. I have already booted it in safemode, did a factory reset  and clear all cache files. I don't see any other options on there.... Help!!!!

 @carolnlanglais ,Carol, You have already tried what normally should have solved you issue, Just a thought remove your SD card and battery,wait 30 min's., reinstall battery and try powering up, then power off and install SD card and power on.  If not resolved maybe try factory reset one more time. Good luck. I hope this helped you out, if so let me know by pressing the helpful button.
