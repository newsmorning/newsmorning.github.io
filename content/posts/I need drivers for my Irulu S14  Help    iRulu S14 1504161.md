## Chosen Solution
 I need drivers for my Irulu S14… Help?  NOTE: My laptop is not in the pull-down.

 @ccinpa
Sorry about that.
I don't know the laptop but it appears that it is has a Windows OS is this correct?
If so can you get into Device manager and check the make and model number of the hardware that you're having problems with and then go to the hardware manufacturer's website for the drivers? Go to Device Manager > right click on the desired hardware device entry > properties > Details
If it is Win10 was wondering if it would be possible to use a Windows Recovery USB and get into the Windows recovery menus area and then use the Troubleshoot > Advanced > reset this PC > Keep my files option and then use the Windows drivers for the laptop. They mightn’t give all the features of the specific drivers from the hardware manufacturer but it still should operate OK
A Win 10 recovery USB can be created from any known working Win 10 computer. All you need is a 8GB USB flashdrive and 40-60 minutes of time.
In the host PC go to Control Panel > Recovery  > Create a recovery drive and follow the prompts.
When you have the USB insert it int the laptop, start it and then change the boot order to USB 1st boot and restart. The laptop should boot from the USB and load the recovery menus.
Alternatively it can be downloaded online. Just search for Win 10 Recovery Tool
If it doesn’t boot from the USB, go into BIOS and enable Legacy USB or CSM ( I don’t know which setting your laptop has), save the changes and restart the laptop.
