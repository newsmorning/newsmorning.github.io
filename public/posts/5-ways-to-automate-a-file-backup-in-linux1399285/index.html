It doesn’t matter if you use your computer for work or personal use; you want to ensure that your data is safe and secure. Linux provides several ways to create and automate backups, and in this article, we will explore five mind-blowing ways to automate backup on Linux.\nrsync: rsync is a versatile command-line utility that allows you to sync files between two directories or systems. Apart from syncing, it supports incremental backups mean syncing only changes among files. For instance, if you create a new file or modify an existing file within the source directory, only those files that have been added or modified will be synced to the destination directory.\nUsing rsync, you can easily create automated tasks that will keep your files safe without human intervention. It can be scheduled with cron jobs or even systemd timers.\nTar: Another popular and easiest backup option is to use tar. It is a command-line utility that is built-in every Linux distribution. Tar is used to create an archive file of files and directories. You can specify the files that you want to include in the archive file, compress it and receive a backup file that can be easily restored.\nAutomating tar backups involves creating a shell script that can be scheduled using cron jobs or systemd timers, similar to rsync. Tar provides several useful options such as incremental backups, compressions, and archiving according to your preferences.\nDéjà Dup: Déjà Dup is a graphical user interface to the powerful backup utility Duplicity. It makes backing up effortless by enabling you to automate the backup process entirely. Déjà Dup supports various storage options, such as local or remote host, cloud storage, or SFTP.\nUsing Déjà Dup for automated backups is easy. In the app’s preferences, you can set a backup schedule and choose the directories you want to save to the destination. It also supports backup encryption, letting you add an additional layer of protection to your data.\nRclone: Rclone is another useful backup tool for Linux that enables you to sync files to cloud storage. It supports various cloud storage providers, including Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon S3.\nUsing Rclone, you can sync your data to the cloud automatically. The tool can be configured easily via the command-line interface or its config wizard. It can also be scheduled using cron or systemd timers.\nBorg: Borg is a deduplicating backup program that creates space-efficient incremental backups. Incremental backups syncs only changes among files. It compresses data before backing it up, ensuring that your backups will take up as little space as possible.\nBorg’s backups are encrypted and authenticated, ensuring maximum security. The program also supports compression, providing an excellent option for minimizing the size of backup data.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, automating backup on Linux is essential to keep your files safe from accidental deletion, virus attacks, or hardware failures. Linux offers several ways to create automatic backups. We have highlighted five backups tools from command-line to graphical user interface and cloud storage providers. Take your time and choose the option that suits your needs, and keep your data safe and secure.\nIt hardly needs to be said but storing and maintaining the integrity of your operating system, personal information, and personal files is basic to data management. While disasters are rare in Linux, protecting your data from system crashes, corrupt files, and lost or stolen computers is still an absolute necessity. Backing up your files protects your data from corruption and restores your data in the unlikely event that something does go wrong. Linux makes file backups easy for new users to its platform. Whether you want to put the whole thing on auto-pilot or manage the nitty-gritty elements of a back-up file by file or folder by folder, Linux has the capacity to deliver accurate backups with a high degree of customization.\nIn Linux, back-ups can be performed via external drives, internal partitions – or both. They can be zipped and compressed, or synced in real-time, file by file and bi-directionally.\nBelow are several ways you can automate file backups in Linux.\nUse Dropbox One popular cloud storage platform is Dropbox. It will host and sync your data across multiple devices. When you download Dropbox to your Linux system, it will create a dedicated folder on your computer. It will also synchronize your files with all devices and computers where the Dropbox client is installed.\nThere is a free version that allows 2GB of free storage. You also have the option to upgrade if you need more. Below are the simple steps to install Dropbox for Ubuntu 18.04. To use the Dropbox installer, you first need to install GDebi. First, open Terminal and type:\n$ sudo apt-get install gdebi\nThis will install GDebi which you need to run the Dropbox Installation. Now download Dropbox from the official site. Select the appropriate package for your Linux Desktop.\nAs you installed GDebi first, you should see a pop-up from the Package Installer with a button to click that says Install Package.\nIf you did not install GDebi first, you can use this command to manually install Dropbox in Terminal.\n$ sudo gdebi dropbox_2015.10.28_amd64.deb\nYou will now see a pop-up box asking you to start Dropbox to complete the installation. Click start Dropbox.\nTo download the property daemon (background process), click OK.\nWhen the download is complete, exit out of the pop-up box. The Dropbox login page will automatically open in your web browser. If you already have a Dropbox account, log in. If you don’t, sign up for one.\nThe installation process will put a folder on your Ubuntu desktop called Dropbox. The data in this folder will be synced across all the devices where you have installed Dropbox, as well as the Dropbox website.\nIf you want to, you can also create subfolders that will also be saved in the same hierarchy to your online account.\nBacula Bacula is one of the most popular and widely used Linux recovery and backup solutions. It is open source and enables users to:\nBackup data.Verify data across networks.Recover damaged or lost files quickly. There are two versions of Bacula. The basic version includes all the features you need to backup and recover your files. If you are looking for more advanced features, they also offer an enterprise solution.\nWith Bacula, you can run it entirely on one computer and backup your data to other types of media, such as disk and tape. It is efficient and relatively easy-to-use. Bacula is scalable because of its modular design and works on a single computer as well as an extensive network with hundreds of machines.\nBacula doesn’t require intervention as it is an automated task once it is configured via a web interface, command line console, or GUI.\nTo learn how to install Bacula, read the Bacula Community Installation Guide.\nFlyBack Software FlyBack is a software program that backs up and restores your files. It is a snapshot tool based on rsync (a command for copying and synchronizing directories and files both locally and remotely.)\nThe functionality is similar to the Mac OS Time Machine by creating successive backup directories that mirror the files you want to backup. It also hard-links unchanged files to your previous backup. Using Flyback, users won’t waste disk space while at the same time it enables them to have access to their files without a recovery program.\nIf you backup to an external drive and your computer crashes, you can move the external drive to a new device. Using any browser, you can then copy your latest backup.\nSome of the features include the ability to:\nSchedule multiple backups.Automatically run selective backups.Schedule when to automatically delete old backups.Have control over the location of the backup as well as what to include or exclude.Scan your directory structure during a backup process.Back up any directory to any location including an external disk. Learn how to install and use FlyBack to automatically back up your files in Linux.\nRelax-and-Recover Also called ReaR, Relax-and-Recover is a tool to back up your files on Linux. It is true to its name in that once you install and set it up, there is nothing else you need to do. The backing up and restoring of your files are done automatically.\nThe set-up is easy, and there is no need to perform maintenance. Both home users and Enterprise users can benefit from ReaR.\nUse the Quickstart Guide to try Relax-and-Recover.\nfwbackups Another free and open-source tool is fwbackups. It is simple yet powerful, enabling you to perform backups easily.\nSchedule backups to remote computers and never worry about losing data. Some of its many features include:\nFlexible backup configuration.A simple interface.The ability to backup all your files.Excluding directories or files from being backed up. Fwbackups’ free and open-source software is cross-platform and full of rich features. It’s simple and intuitive interface enables you to back up your files easily.\nLearn how to install and use fwbackups for easy and automated backups from its user guide.\n","wordCount":"1527","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Janet Klan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-ways-to-automate-a-file-backup-in-linux1399285/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You'll Never Lose Your Files Again with These 5 Mind-Blowing Ways to Automate Backup on Linux!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 17, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1527 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Janet Klan</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#use-dropbox>Use Dropbox</a></li><li><a href=#bacula>Bacula</a></li><li><a href=#flyback-software>FlyBack Software</a></li><li><a href=#relax-and-recover>Relax-and-Recover</a></li><li><a href=#fwbackups>fwbackups</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Introduction:</p><p>As we depend more and more on digital files, the need to back them up has become ever more critical.
