Lost Ark players REJOICE! Discover the SECRETS to escaping a shipwreck like a PRO gamer!

Shipwrecks are a common occurrence in Lost Ark. They can be a source of loot and adventure, but they can also be a dangerous trap that ends in defeat. If you find yourself in a shipwreck, here are some tips to help you escape like a pro gamer.

The first step is to assess the situation. Look around and take note of the exit points. There may be multiple ways out, and some may be better than others. You'll want to keep an eye out for any obstacles, traps or dangers that may hinder your escape.

Use your skills to your advantage. Most classes have abilities that allow them to dodge, jump, or move quickly. Use them to avoid traps and dangers, and to navigate obstacles. If you have a ranged attack, use it to hit switches or targets that are out of reach.

Working as a team can be helpful. Coordinate with your group and assign roles. One player can focus on clearing enemies, while another can try to activate switches or open doors. This will help you work together more efficiently and can make your escape much easier.

Look for loot, but don't get greedy. While it's tempting to grab everything you see, taking too much time or risking everything for one item could be detrimental to your survival. Focus on escaping first, and then loot when you're in a safer environment.

Lastly, don't give up! It may take some trial and error, but with persistence and a bit of luck, you can make your escape. Keep trying until you succeed.

In conclusion, escaping a shipwreck in Lost Ark can be a challenging experience, but with the right approach, you can do it like a pro. Be vigilant, use your abilities, work as a team, and don't give up. With these tips in mind, you'll be able to maneuver your way out of any tricky situation. Happy adventuring!

Lost Ark has plenty of diverse mechanics that you can never get tired of. Sailing is one of the ways to traverse across the oceans. You can loot underwater treasures, recover cargo, and more. But sailing in the blue oceans of Arkesia works slightly differently than other MMOs. While you sail from one place to other, your ship’s hull (main body) wears out. The ship can sink into the oceans if you get to zero durability. As there are plenty of things you can do whilst sailing, what can you do if caught in a shipwreck? Haberk to the ship quest is one of the sailing quests in which you will face this situation regardless of your ship’s durability. Not to worry, here’s our guide that explains how to leave a shipwreck in Lost Ark.
 
## How to Leave & Get off a Shipwreck in Lost Ark?
