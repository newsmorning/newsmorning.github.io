Title: You're Paying TOO MUCH TAX! Find Out How to SAVE BIG with These Top 5 Differences between Income Tax and Payroll Tax - Illustrated with Infographics!

Introduction:

Taxes are a necessary evil, and we all have to deal with them every year. However, paying too much tax can be a blow to your bank account. One way to reduce the amount of tax you pay is to understand the differences between income tax and payroll tax. Knowing the differences can help you take advantage of available deductions and credits, which can lower your overall tax bill. This article will explore the top five differences between income tax and payroll tax and how you can use them to save big.

1. What is Income Tax?

Income tax is a tax on the income that you earn. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines your income tax liability based on your taxable income, which is your total income after deductions and exemptions. Your tax liability is calculated based on income tax rates that increase as your income increases. Your income tax liability can be reduced by claiming deductions, such as mortgage interest or charitable contributions.

2. What is Payroll Tax?

Payroll tax is a tax that is withheld from your paycheck by your employer. The payroll tax includes two parts: Social Security tax and Medicare tax. The Social Security tax funds the Social Security program, which provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible recipients. The Medicare tax funds the Medicare program, which provides health insurance to eligible recipients.

3. The Difference in Tax Rates:

One of the significant differences between income tax and payroll tax is the tax rates. The income tax rates are progressive, which means that the more you earn, the higher your tax rate will be. However, the payroll tax rates are flat, which means that everyone pays the same percentage of their income in Social Security and Medicare tax.

4. Deductions and Credits:

Deductions and credits can help reduce your tax liability. Income tax allows for various deductions and credits, such as education expenses, medical expenses, and retirement contributions. However, payroll tax does not offer any deductions or credits to lower your tax bill.

5. Timing of Payments:

Income tax is paid annually and can be paid in a lump sum or through estimated quarterly tax payments. Payroll tax is withheld from your paycheck throughout the year, so you don't have to worry about a large tax bill at the end of the year.
