If you're an iPhone user, you know the importance of the Home button. It's the key to unlocking your phone, accessing Siri, and navigating through apps. So, when my iPhone 8's Home button stopped working, I knew I had to get it fixed. 

After researching online and watching countless YouTube videos, I decided to replace the Home button myself. It seemed like a straightforward process, and it would save me the hassle and expense of taking it to a repair shop. 

I ordered a replacement Home button online and eagerly awaited its arrival. When it finally came, I carefully followed the instructions and replaced the original Home button with the new one. It was a bit challenging, but I managed to do it without any major issues. 

However, to my dismay, the Home button still didn't work. I tried everything, from rechecking the installation to resetting my phone, but nothing seemed to fix the issue. I was frustrated and disappointed that my DIY repair didn't work out.

I decided to take my phone to a professional repair shop to see if they could fix the problem. They examined my phone and determined that the issue wasn't with the Home button but with the phone's logic board. 

I was shocked. I had no idea that replacing the Home button could cause such a major problem. The technician explained to me that iPhone 8's home buttons are uniquely paired to its logic board and that replacing one without the other could cause the Home button to malfunction or the phone to stop working altogether.

I had to weigh my options. I could either pay to have my phone fixed or purchase a new one. I ultimately decided to buy a new phone since the cost of repair exceeded the value of the phone. 

In conclusion, replacing your iPhone's Home button may seem like an easy fix, but it's much more complicated than it appears. It's essential to research and consider all your options before attempting any DIY repairs. In my case, I learned the hard way that not everything can be solved with a YouTube tutorial.

## Chosen Solution
 My wife dropped her iPhone 8 and there was no visible damage but the home button stopped working. I tired a soft reset, hard reset, factory reset, and firmware update. These did not work, so I replaced the home button with no results. So I tried replacing the entire screen along with a home button that I knew worked from use on another phone. Nothing is working and it is becoming extremely frustrating. Is there another part that I need to replace? Maybe the charing port assembly? (some call it the dock assembly?)

 Firstly you cannot change a home button on the iPhone 8. It will not work at all. Try putting the original home button on your new screen if you havenâ€™t already.
If this also fails you will need to take it to apple if you want your touch ID back or you could purchase a (Universal home button) it will work the same as an original one but without the touch ID.
