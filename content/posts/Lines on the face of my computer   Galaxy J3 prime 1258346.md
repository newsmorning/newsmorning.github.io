You won't believe what caused these strange lines on my Galaxy J3 Prime computer - the truth will shock you!

If you've ever encountered bizarre lines on your Galaxy J3 Prime's display, you're not alone. The condition is becoming increasingly prevalent on the device, and it's causing anxiety among users. The truth of the matter, though, may surprise you.

First and foremost, it's crucial to understand that unusual lines on the screen aren't always a result of hardware damage. Sometimes, it may be due to software issues or user error. Luckily, you can quickly resolve these problems with a few troubleshooting procedures.

If you're dealing with less dramatic lines that appear suddenly, you can try restarting your phone. Hold down the power button until the "Power off" prompt shows up; tap on "Restart," and your phone will turn off and reboot. Restarting your device clears system memory, which may fix the issue.

If restarting doesn't work, try checking for updates. If there's a software update available for your Galaxy J3 Prime, installing it might remove any bugs, glitches, or compatibility issues that may cause the lines on your phone's screen.

Some users have also resolved the strange line problem by recalibrating their phone's touch sensitivity. To do this, go to Settings > Display > Touch Sensitivity and adjust it to your preference.

If none of the troubleshooting actions worked, then it's safe to say that your Galaxy J3 Prime's screen may have hardware damage. One notable reason for the lines could be pressure from an impact or a fall.

There are other less likely reasons too. For instance, one user reported that their cat chewed on the charging cord, causing a power surge that resulted in the strange lines. Another user claimed that they slept with their phone next to their head, leading to overheating, which resulted in a line on the screen.

To summarize, there's no one definitive answer for strange lines on the Galaxy J3 Prime. Sometimes it's a minor issue that can be resolved via software, other times it's a more significant problem that requires professional attention. Just remember that if all else fails, the truth about what caused the strange lines might surprise you, so don't rule out the unusual suspects.

## Chosen Solution
 My phone slipped from my hands and fell face down on the floor.  When I picked it up there were long lines on the right side of the face; otherwise there were small verticle lines up and down the face of the cellphone.  The phone will not respond except of be powered down or restarted.

 the screen is broken, get it replaced and it should be fine
