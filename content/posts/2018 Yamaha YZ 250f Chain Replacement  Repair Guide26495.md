## Introduction
 
Riding a dirtbike that has a worn-out chain can be harmful to both the bike as well as the rider. It is important to properly maintain these components prior to use for safe operations. The chain on the bike is very important as it is what drives the rear wheel to spin. The chain is driven by a front and rear sprocket. The front sprocket is connected to the dirtbike transmission and the rear sprocket is connected to the rear wheel. Together the sprockets and chain must function cohesively. Also, ensure the dirtbike is clean to prevent debris from going into places it does not belong.  Give yourself a clear work area to help the process go along smoothly.
 
In steps 5 and 12 of the guide, you will be required to use an angle grinder to cut rivets off of a chain. Using a grinder can be very dangerous if you have minimal experience so it is important to exercise caution when using this tool.  When grinding clear your working area of anything that is flammable to prevent a fire from starting.  Lastly, before beginning, ensure the dirtbike is turned off as you can suffer traumatic injuries to your hands if they are caught in the sprockets.
 
Once you have done the steps mentioned above, you are now ready to begin the process of replacing your chain!
 
*When replacing the chain on a dirtbike it is also important to replace both sprockets to ensure the longevity of the parts. The steps to replacing the sprockets are NOT provided in this guide.
