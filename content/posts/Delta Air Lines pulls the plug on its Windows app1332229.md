Delta Air Lines, one of the largest and most trusted airlines in the world, has abandoned its Windows app. The app was a popular tool for many Delta customers, enabling them to book flights, manage reservations, and get real-time flight updates. However, the news of its discontinuation has come as a shock to many users, leaving them perplexed and disappointed. But why did Delta Air Lines make this decision? In this article, we will take a closer look.

Firstly, let's examine the role of Windows apps in modern-day technology. Windows apps are generally designed for desktops, laptops, and tablets that run on the Microsoft Windows operating system. While originally invented back in the 1980s, Windows apps have been losing traction in recent years, with the rise of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Today, the majority of people use their mobile devices for airline bookings, reservations, and pertinent information.

Delta Air Lines has recognized this trend and has placed a strong emphasis on its mobile app, which is much more user-friendly, intuitive, and informative than its Windows counterpart. According to Delta Air Lines, the decision to discontinue the Windows app was based on its low usage and the high costs of maintaining and updating the app, which ultimately did not justify the financial outlay.

Furthermore, Delta Air Lines has stated that its mobile app will continue to offer all the infrastructure and features of the Windows app, providing customers with comprehensive and seamless services that are easily accessible through their smartphones and tablets. The mobile app is available for free download on both the Apple App Store and Google Play.

Despite this, some customers are still disappointed, stating that they prefer to use their desktops or laptops to manage their Delta flights. However, as technology advances, it is clear that mobile devices are becoming the primary mode of accessing airline services, and this trend is unlikely to change in the near future.

In conclusion, the decision by Delta Air Lines to discontinue its Windows app is not surprising, given the trend in technology and the overall shift towards mobile devices. While some customers may be disappointed, Delta Air Lines has made it clear that its mobile app will provide customers with a high-quality service that is comprehensive, intuitive, and accessible. As technology continues to evolve, it is important that airlines keep pace with developments to provide their customers with the best possible experience.

Delta Air Lines has formally given up on its app support for Windows Phone as the Fly Delta app is no longer operational on the platform. The app now greets users with a message that says Delta has pulled the plug on Fly Delta for Microsoft’s mobile operating system.
 
A button that follows the notification, however, gives users the option to update the app, giving the impression that it’s all that’s needed to get the app working back again. That is not going to be the case, though, as clicking the button simply leads to the same Delta link in Windows Store.
 
We’re sorry for the inconvenience as this app is no longer supported. You can always visit delta.com from your mobile phone to book a flight, check in and view flight status.
 
Microsoft already removed the app from its listing, which means users will need to access the Delta booking page via a direct link. Some see this process as an inconvenience as users must visit Delta’s website instead of booking a flight right from their fingertips.
 
The Update Now button gave the impression that Microsoft plans to release a Universal Windows Platform replacement app in the future. It’s a possibility that Delta customers can only hope for at present. For one, Microsoft did not mention any plan for a new UWP on the notice. Also, Microsoft would have waited for the app to receive updates instead of completely dropping support for the app. Right now, all a customer can do is visit Delta’s website to book flights.
 
Delta’s move coincides with the release of IDC’s latest Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. The report predicts the market share of Windows Phone will decline to 0.1 percent in 2020. Windows Phone could also hit 1 million unit shipments in four years, provided all units sell out in that period.
