Have you ever experienced changing your phone's battery or USB cable and it suddenly stops working? That's precisely what happened to me when I replaced my HTC One M8's battery and USB cable. But wait until you hear the jaw-dropping reason behind it.

At first, I thought it was just a regular case of a dead battery, and since I've had my phone for quite some time, it was time to replace it. I found an HTC One M8 battery replacement online and ordered it right away. I also purchased a new USB cable as my old one was frayed and not functioning well.

When the package arrived, I was excited to put in the new battery and use my phone once again without the fear of it dying too quickly. However, after putting in the new battery and connecting it to the new USB cable, something was wrong. My HTC One M8 wouldn't turn on.

I was perplexed. I made sure that everything was connected correctly, and I followed the instructions carefully. But no matter how many times I tried, my phone wouldn't budge. I was about to give up until I came across an article online that mentioned something interesting.

The article was about how some HTC One M8 owners experienced the same issue as me after replacing their battery and USB cable. After some research, it was discovered that the cause of the problem was not with the new parts but with the phone itself.

It turns out that when the battery of an HTC One M8 is fully depleted, it goes into a state called "deep sleep," which prevents it from turning on even when you put in a new battery. This is where the jaw-dropping part comes in.

To wake up the phone from deep sleep mode, you need to connect the HTC One M8 to a USB charging source for about two hours continuously. After that, it should wake up, and you can use it as usual.

I tried this method, and to my surprise, my HTC One M8 came alive after two hours of charging. It was like nothing happened, and my phone was running smoothly again. I was thrilled that I didn't have to replace my phone, and it saved me a lot of money.

In conclusion, if you're an HTC One M8 user, it's essential to know that sometimes, replacing your battery or USB cable can result in your phone going into deep sleep mode. But don't fret; all you need to do is connect it to a USB charging source for about two hours, and it should wake up. Hopefully, this little article saved you from panicking and running to the nearest phone repair shop.

## Chosen Solution
 Not too long ago my HTC M8 simply stopped charging or turning on so I've used the ifixit guides to swap out the battery and USB module (using Nitrile gloves, and an anti-static tray).
Since replacing these, the phone now indicates it is plugged in by showing a flashing red/orange light at the top and the charging picture on the screen, but only if the plug is held toward the back.
It's been kept overnight in a position that leaves it showing as charging, and again most of the morning since getting into work (it's now 11am, been charging over 2 hours since getting in) but it won't switch on, and if I recall correctly it is charging when the red light is solid, not flashing.
I've only just tried the method of holding all 3 buttons for 2 minutes to reset the charging circuit and put it back on charge to see if it finishes charging before I finish work today, but as of yet it still doesn't switch on.
Can anyone suggest what else I can check? Should I try replacing the motherboard as well?  I've got this, and an HTC-built Nexus 9 both died within weeks of each other and i'm desperate to get a working device again.

 You can't swap logic boards from different series phones.
The issue sounds like a defective charging port assembly as you need to hold it in an angle for the charging to start.
