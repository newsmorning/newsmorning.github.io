## Chosen Solution
 I need to clean my keyboard, but I’m not sure what are some safe cleaning options.

 The first thing I would recommend is to use a can of air. It is probably the safest way to clean a keyboard, but is mainly used for crumbs or dust. If it’s sticky, you can use a LCD screen cleaner, and spray the key and let it soak for a few minutes. Then, use a can of compressed air to blow the excess screen cleaner out from under the keys.
