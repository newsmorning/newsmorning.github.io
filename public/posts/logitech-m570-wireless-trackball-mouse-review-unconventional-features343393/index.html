Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse Review Reveals Unconventional Features You Never Knew Existed!\nIf you’re looking for a quality and functional wireless trackball mouse that offers innovative and time-saving features, Logitech M570 might just be the perfect fit for you. The mouse offers an unconventional design that differs from any other traditional mouse, and offers infinite scrolling, programmable buttons, and trackball scrolling.\nThe design\nThe Logitech M570 has a design that’s not similar to any other mouse on the market. First, it features a large trackball on top of the mouse that replaces the traditional scroll wheel. You don’t need any desk space to move your cursor with this design, you just use your thumb to move the trackball instead. The mouse is perfectly ergonomic and fits comfortably in your hand, leaving your wrist relaxed and comfortable.\nInfinite Scrolling\nOne of the most innovative features of the Logitech M570 is its infinite scrolling that allows you to effortlessly scroll through long documents and web pages. Apart from the standard scrolling method where you have to slide your finger on the wheel, this mouse allows you to flick the wheel down and let it spin, while a ratchet system snaps it into place whenever you’re done. This feature boosts your productivity and saves you time as you don’t have to keep scrolling up and down.\nProgrammable Buttons\nThe Logitech M570 also has programmable buttons that you can customize to suit your needs. The mouse features two buttons on the side that you can assign for tasks like copy and paste, forward and backward navigation or other commands that suit your work style. The mouse also comes with Logitech’s unifying receiver, a small USB dongle that lets the mouse communicate with your PC without requiring additional ports.\nTrackball Scrolling\nAnother amazing feature of the Logitech M570 is the trackball scrolling feature. It provides smooth scrolling using the trackball on top of the mouse, and they come in handy when you need to navigate large images, wide web pages or long documents. This feature eliminates the need to repeatedly slide the scroll bar as you scroll, hence reducing the risk of repetitive strain injuries.\nConclusion\nThe Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse has a unique design that differs from any other mouse on the market. It packs amazing features such as infinite scrolling, programmable buttons, and trackball scrolling, that not only boost your productivity but also reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries. If you’re looking for a mouse that offers quality and innovative features, Logitech M570 is the perfect choice for you.\nLogitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse\nLong battery life\nIncredibly comfortable\nWon’t damage desk\nQuite large\nTakes some getting used to\nThe Logitech M570 is a retro mouse that brings back the trackball, improving long-term comfort and ergonomics.\nDesign Setup Process Wireless Performance Comfort Price Competition Final Verdict Specs We purchased the Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.\nThe Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse puts an emphasis on comfort and ergonomics above all else. The trackball design takes some getting used to, but if you can get used to the unique input interface, this mouse will reward you with long-term comfort.\nDesign: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder To say the design of the Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse is unconventional would be an understatement. Compared to nearly any other mouse, it looks like it was made for an alien. The interesting aesthetic isn’t an accident though. Unlike other mice that require you to grip the mouse and move it around the desk, the Logitech M570 remains stationary. To navigate, you simply place your hand on the mouse and your thumb on the oversized blue trackball. This design not only relieves pressure that’s otherwise put on the outside of your hand, but it also minimizes overall movement by using only your thumb as the control.\nAdmittedly, it took a bit of time to get used to. After over ten years with a more conventional mouse design, testing out this layout was a change of pace. However, hour by hour, it became clear why this ancient design is still going strong. It feels natural and although movements felt imprecise compared to other mice, it didn’t put nearly as much strain on our hands. We’re over 50 hours deep into testing this mouse at the time of writing this review and it’s safe to say we’re not in any rush to go back to a conventional mouse. To say the design of the Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse is unconventional would be an understatement. Compared to nearly any other mouse, it looks like it was made for an alien\nSetup Process: Plug and play Setting up the Logitech M570 is straightforward. Once the mouse, batteries, and receiver are removed from the plastic packaging, it’s as simple as putting the batteries in place and plugging in the small USB receiver. Immediately, both our macOS and Windows computers recognized the mouse. Aside from making some tracking speed adjustments in the mouse settings menu of the respective operating systems, we were good to go. Wireless: Reliable and incredibly power efficient The Logitech M570 uses a dedicated 2.4GHz receiver that plugs directly into any USB-A port on a desktop or laptop computer. Logitech rates the maximum operating distance at 33 feet and based on our testing that proved to be accurate, give or take a few feet depending on any obstructions there are. Performance: A unique interface makes for a learning curve The trackball is responsive and precise, the buttons give a nice tactile feel and the scroll wheel is adequate. We wouldn’t suggest gaming with this mouse, but for nearly everything else, from web browsing to editing documents, it gets the job done without any issues. We even spent some time in Photoshop and Illustrator with the M570 and realized we were able to more accurately create shapes and edit images due to the more natural feel of the trackball compared to conventional mice. Of course, a lot of this comes down to personal preference, but it’s well worth noting. It looks unusual, is bulky, and takes some time to get the hang of, but once we familiarized ourselves with the new form of input, it became clear why this mouse has an almost cult-like following.\nLogitech states the mouse can run for up to 18 months on a single pair of AA batteries. We spent 50 hours into the mouse, so we can’t verify Logitech’s claim, but based on various forums and reviews from other users around the web, a year-and-a-half battery life doesn’t seem too far-fetched. Comfort: Your hands will thank you greatly While it might not win in specs, anything the M570 lacks in that department is made up for ten times over with comfort. The curved, crescent shape contours perfectly to hands small and large. The grooves to the right of the left/right mouse buttons serve as perfect resting locations for pinky and ring fingers and the prominent ridge creates a natural bowl-like shape for your palm to rest on. Using our thumb as the main form of input did take some time. It’s almost as though you have to rewire your brain a bit in terms of how you interact with your computer, but within an hour or two it felt like second nature. Better yet, a few days into testing we realized our thumbs and hands as a whole weren’t cramping up and clenching like other mice tend to cause. Another added benefit of the stationary design is that you can rest your arm on your computer chair’s armrest and keep it supported while still moving the cursor around the screen.\nAnother added benefit of the stationary design is that you can rest your arm on your computer chair’s armrest and keep it supported while still moving the cursor around the screen. No more rubbing your elbow against your chair’s armrest for hours on end. Price: Right where it should be The Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse retails for $50. It might not have the specs and customizable buttons other $50 mice have, but to compare it to other mice would be unfair. It’s a unique product that stands out amongst the crowd and offers a comfortable experience few other mice can offer. It’s the most comfortable mouse we’ve tested and considering it’s likely to last years into the future, it’s a small price to pay for the level of comfort it affords. Competition: Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery Considering the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is at the top of the charts in terms of features and price, it’s a bit difficult to directly compare it to other portable mice on the market. That said, there are two others that offer similar functionality at lower price points. The first alternative is Logitech’s own M535 Bluetooth Mouse. It retails for $39.99, a full $30 cheaper than the MX Anywhere 2S and offers the same Bluetooth connectivity. It lacks the additional 2.4GHz receiver and swaps a rechargeable battery for two AA batteries, but features a 10-month lifespan and offers the same basic functionality at a lower cost. The second alternative is the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Bluetooth Mouse. Like the Logitech M535, it retails for $39.99. It features a sculpted ergonomic design, includes a four-way scroll wheel, and works on most surfaces thanks to Microsoft’s BlueTrack Technology. It even has a dedicated button on the side that can be programmed to control different settings. Similar Products We’ve Reviewed: Logitech MX Anywhere 2S Apple Magic Mouse 2 Logitech G602 Gaming Mouse Unique, but oh so comfortable.We were surprised by how well we liked the Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse.

Like the Logitech M535, it retails for $39.99. It features a sculpted ergonomic design, includes a four-way scroll wheel, and works on most surfaces thanks to Microsoft’s BlueTrack Technology. It even has a dedicated button on the side that can be programmed to control different settings. </p><h3 id=similar-products-weve-reviewed>Similar Products We&rsquo;ve Reviewed:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#similar-products-weve-reviewed>#</a></h3><ul><li>Logitech MX Anywhere 2S</li><li>Apple Magic Mouse 2</li><li>Logitech G602 Gaming Mouse</li></ul><p>Unique, but oh so comfortable.We were surprised by how well we liked the Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball Mouse.
