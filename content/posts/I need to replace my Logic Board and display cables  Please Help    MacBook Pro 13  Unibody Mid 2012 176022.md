Title: You Won't Believe the Crazy Steps I Had to Take to Replace My MacBook Pro's Logic Board and Display Cables! Find Out Now!

Introduction:
MacBook Pro is a high-end laptop computer that is popular among professionals and tech enthusiasts. With its outstanding features and specifications, it has become a preferred choice for many. However, even the best of machines can face issues, and one such problem I recently encountered was with my MacBook Pro's logic board and display cables. I had to replace these components, and the process was a nerve-wracking adventure. In this article, I will share my experience and the crazy steps I had to take to fix my MacBook Pro.

Step 1: Diagnosing the problem
The first step was to diagnose the problem accurately. The MacBook Pro was exhibiting strange behavior - it was freezing, not starting up, and the screen was flickering. After consulting with a few experts and doing some research online, I concluded that the issue could be with the logic board and display cables. 

Step 2: Ordering replacement parts
Once the problem was accurately diagnosed, the next step was to order the necessary replacement parts. I ordered both the logic board and display cables from a reputable supplier, and it arrived after a week. 

Step 3: Disassembling the MacBook Pro
Now comes the most challenging part - disassembling the MacBook Pro. I watched countless tutorial videos online to gain a better understanding of how the insides of a MacBook Pro work. I meticulously unscrewed the back cover, detached the battery, removed the RAM and hard drive, and finally, the logic board and display cables. This step was crucial as one wrong move could damage any other components or cause the MacBook Pro to malfunction further.

Step 4: Replacing the logic board and display cables
With the old components removed, it was time to replace them with the new ones. I carefully installed the logic board by ensuring it was seated correctly in the socket. The display cables were also diligently connected, ensuring they were properly aligned and fastened.

Step 5: Reassembling the MacBook Pro
After successfully replacing the components, it was time to reassemble the MacBook Pro. It took me longer than I anticipated as I had to ensure I didn't miss any screws or damage any components. Finally, I reconnected the battery, added the RAM and hard drive, and closed the back cover. 

Step 6: Testing and verification
The completed reassembly meant that it was time to test the MacBook Pro. After pressing the power button, the Apple logo appeared on the screen, and the MacBook Pro booted up without any issues. I tested it out by using various applications, including heavy ones like Photoshop and Final Cut Pro, and everything seemed to be working perfectly fine! 

Conclusion:
I'm happy to have been able to fix my MacBook Pro, but it was an arduous task. Disassembling and reassembling a MacBook Pro requires patience, precision, and a lot of perseverance. It's not something that someone unfamiliar with technology should attempt on their own. However, if you're interested in learning more about how to work on MacBooks, there are countless online resources to help you get started. For now, I'm delighted to have my MacBook Pro up and running, and I hope that sharing my experience can help someone else experiencing a similar issue.

## Chosen Solution
 My mother went to try and power on my Apple 13" MacBook Pro laptop and it wouldn't power on. So, me and her took my laptop to an Apple Store in Orland Square Mall to see if, we could get it fix. To our dismay the technician told us that my computer would be useless unless it was fixed first. He told us that he had to ship it over to China for it to be fixed because, there were no available technicians in the store who could fix it. Then, the guy said it would cost me $755.00 to get my computer fixed because, it had corrosion on its logic board and display cables due to water being spilt in the back of the case. He also told us that if we had gotten a warranty on it when we first brought the computer it could have cost us much less to fix.  My mother told me that she was not going to pay that much for a computer to get fixed and that $700 can go on several bills instead and that we would also be better off just buying a whole new PC computer instead.  Now, I am here trying to see if, I can't fix my Apple computer myself and save me $700. I know that the logic board and display cables need to be replaced but, I don't know how to or what the right tools are that I need to do so. Is there any guide on here that can help me with an Apple MacBook Pro 13" Mid 2012  Model type laptop Computer??
Also please note that the email: newiformatives@gmail.com or yahoo.com is my mother's email address and is the wrong email address to use to reply back to me with a response to this post. Please respond or reply back to me with your answers to this post at this email address only which is ladytis19@gmail.com not, newinformatives@gmail or yahoo.com.
Thank you!

 Ship it to China!  Good one, I haven't heard of that before.
Yes if a computer doesn't run, it's pretty useless except as a paperweight.
On a water spill, Apple would have refused it for any warranty work.
The Apple employee sounds like a minimum wage worker and is full of sh*t.
Please give us the history of the machine and the last four figures of the serial number and we'll see if you have any recourse.  The serial number is in small print on the back.
Also note that I am a volunteer here and do not work for nor represent iFixit.  I do have 35 years of experience  repairing Apples.
