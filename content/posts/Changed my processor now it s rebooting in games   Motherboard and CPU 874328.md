Title: Unbelievable! I Upgraded My Processor and Now My Games Are Constantly Rebooting - Find Out What Went Wrong with My Motherboard and CPU!

Introduction:
There's nothing more frustrating than spending your hard-earned money on upgrading your PC components only to find out that something is not working properly. In this article, we will delve into the story of a user who upgraded their processor and ended up with a constant reboot issue while gaming.

Body:
The protagonist of our tale had a good gaming rig that needed an upgrade after a few years of usage, and so they settled on upgrading the processor. They went for the latest Intel Core i9-10900K and were excited to dive into their favorite games with the higher performance that the new processor promised. However, shortly after installation, they noticed that the PC started to reboot randomly while gaming, which was a severe inconvenience.

After much frustration and troubleshooting, they found out that the problem was caused by the motherboard not being able to handle the power requirement of the new processor. The previous processor had a lower TDP (Thermal Design Power) rating than the new i9 processor, and so the motherboard was not equipped to handle the increased load.

Further investigation revealed that the motherboard was not listed as compatible with the new i9 processor in its official specification sheet. In retrospect, the protagonist realized that they had overlooked the compatibility factor while selecting the processor.

The lesson learned here is to always check the compatibility of your components before purchasing them. Choosing components that are not compatible with each other can lead to unforeseen issues and damage to your hardware.

Conclusion:
Upgrading your PC components can enhance your gaming experience, but it's crucial to check the compatibility of each component to avoid any compatibility issues. Our protagonist learned this the hard way and had to invest additional money to upgrade to a compatible motherboard. So, when upgrading your PC components, take the proper precautions to ensure compatibility and avoid any costly surprises.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys, I use my computer for games and work. I wanted to upgrade the processor to improve some activities and games, used to have an i5 2310, decided to upgrade for an E3 1240 v2. I know it's an old machine,but money is really short and it's the best I could get. However I've been having a problem, the machine is running all the benchmarks and stress tests ok and without any problems so far, but if I try to play games it reboot without any warning and stuck in a bios screen, then I have to unplug from the socket for it to start again without the bios screen. I've tried to play Warzone and Total War Troy and this happened. It was rebooting in 3 minutes, then I thought it was a driver issue and formated the computer from the scratch, all drives new. Now I can play for like 15-20 minutes before it reebots. Do you guys know what may be causing this reboot issue, any idea how can I fix it?
My computer specs is: E3 1240 V2 GA B75M D3H GTX 960 G1 gaming 4gb 12 gb 1333mhz ddr3 ram Corsair 430w Fujitsu SSD 500gb It was running fine with i5 2310, just weak for games, this is running better but it reboots! Thanks!

 If I understand correctly, you upgraded from an i5 to a Xeon? Based on what you're saying that likely rules out the thermal/power issues. Have you tried resetting the CMOS by unplugging the PC and removing the coin cell from the motherboard for 30 minutes?
Your ram may be an issue, Xeons can be more picky about ram config. Try just one stick and see if it still crashes. Make sure if it crashes like that, that you try another stick to rule out that single stick as being a bad stick.
If you're still not 100% sure about your ram being good, you can always run memtest 86 to double check it.
Update (10/29/2020)
What kind of CPU cooler do you have on the CPU? It sounds like youâ€™re running into thermal issues from my experience. Otherwise it may be a limitation of your PSU or your motherboard to deliver enough power.

 Hi @leandro_smg
have you checked that the latestchipset and BIOS versions are installed? Check which revision motherboard you have (REV 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2) to make sure that you're on the correct download page.
Just a thought
