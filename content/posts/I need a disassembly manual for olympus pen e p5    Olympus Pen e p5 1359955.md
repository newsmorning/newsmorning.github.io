## Chosen Solution
 Hello
I dropped my camera and found the glass cover of my lcd screen cracked.
I found some lcd panel replacements on ebay but I'm not so lucky about repair manuals.

 Just uploaded a guide. I figured out by myself how to fix it. Hope it helps, take a look at it.

 Sadly, this is such a new model I don't think anyone has figured out how to service it yet on the Web.
Try contacting Olympus directly to see if they have one to sell. If you do get it appear please help the others by creating a guide with what you can. Thanks!
