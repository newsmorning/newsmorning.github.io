Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Replace Your Toyota Corolla Windshield Wipers – 2012 to Present Models!

Introduction:
Windshield wipers are an essential safety feature that keeps your windshield clean and clear during harsh weather conditions. Timely replacement of worn-out wipers is necessary to ensure optimum visibility and safety during your car's operation. However, replacing windshield wipers might seem like a daunting task that requires professional help. But today, we're here to tell you that anyone can replace their windscreen wipers on a Toyota Corolla, and it's effortless! In this article, we'll guide you through the easy steps to replace your Toyota Corolla windshield wipers from 2012 to present models.

Step 1: Gather The Required Materials
Before you begin, it's essential to make sure you have all the necessary materials. You'll need a replacement set of wipers that is compatible with your Toyota Corolla's year and model. You can find the windshield wiper size required in your owner's manual or by using an online tire-size calculator. Additionally, you'll need a cloth or towel, pliers, and a flathead screwdriver.

Step 2: Remove The Old Wiper Blades
The first step is to remove the old and worn-out wiper blades from your Toyota Corolla. To do this, lift the wiper arm away from the windshield, so it's in a vertical position. Then, flip the small tab located towards the base of the wiper blade to release it. Depending on the model, you may have to use pliers to remove the metal retaining clip that holds the wiper blade onto the arm. Afterwards, slowly slide the wiper blade off the arm.

Step 3: Install The New Wiper Blades
Once you've removed the old wiper blade, it's time to install the new one. Start by positioning the new wiper blade onto the arm in the same location where you removed the old one. Ensure that the hooked end of the wiper blade is facing the windshield. Then, listen for the click sound to ensure it's securely in place. Repeat this process for the other wiper blade if required.

Step 4: Test The New Wiper Blades
The final step is to test and make sure that the new wiper blades are working correctly. Turn on your Toyota Corolla's ignition and activate the windshield wipers. Observe the blades to ensure they wipe smoothly and streak-free across the windshield. If they make noise or smear the windshield, repeat the previous steps to ensure they are correctly installed.

Conclusion:
Replacing the windshield wipers on your Toyota Corolla might have seemed like a daunting task, but as you can see, it's a quick and easy process. With only a few tools and the right replacement wiper blades, anyone can do it themselves. Remember, timely replacement of your windshield wipers is essential for safe driving, so ensure you have them checked regularly. And now that you know how to replace the wiper blades on your Toyota Corolla from 2012 to present models, you can enjoy a clear view of the road ahead during any weather condition.
