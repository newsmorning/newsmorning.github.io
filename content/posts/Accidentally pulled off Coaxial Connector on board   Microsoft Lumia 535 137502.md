Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Accidentally Pulled Off the Coaxial Connector on my Microsoft Lumia 535!

Are you a victim of accidentally pulling off the coaxial connector on your Microsoft Lumia 535? Have you been wondering if there's a way to fix this issue? Well, fear not, as I too have been through this situation, and let me tell you, it's not as bad as it seems.

One fine day, while using my Microsoft Lumia 535, I noticed that the Wi-Fi signals were not as strong as they used to be. I tried various methods to fix this issue, but nothing seemed to work. It was then that I accidentally pulled off the coaxial connector.

At first, I was startled and worried that I may have to replace my phone. However, upon researching and learning about this issue, I found that fixing it was not as complicated as it seemed.

To begin with, the coaxial connector is a small part of the phone that connects the Wi-Fi antennas to the motherboard. This tiny component is responsible for transmitting the Wi-Fi signals to the phone, and when it is pulled off accidentally, it can disrupt the signals.

But fixing it is relatively easy. All you need to do is open up the phone, locate the lost coaxial connector, and reattach it to the motherboard. This process may seem daunting, but with the right tools, a little patience, and some research, it can be done easily.

Luckily for me, I had some experience working with mobile phones and was able to fix this issue on my own. Within a few minutes, I was able to open up the phone, locate the lost coaxial connector, and reattach it to the motherboard.

Once everything was in place, I turned on my phone and immediately noticed that the Wi-Fi signals were back to their full strength. I was thrilled to have fixed this issue on my own, and it saved me both time and money.

In conclusion, accidentally pulling off the coaxial connector on your Microsoft Lumia 535 may seem like a daunting situation, but it is not as bad as it seems. With a little research and patience, anyone can fix this issue on their own. So, before you start panicking, take a deep breath, open up your phone, and fix the issue in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 Title says it all. Was wondering if I can solder it back on, or there is a trace I have to glue down. Or if neither will work
Update (03/16/2018)

 @snakes202 you need to solder this back on. The pins in the North and South direction on your board (picture one) need that connected to carry the signal

 If on pcb pads is still in place then flux it and drag solder it or shield the plastic part up and with hot air rework station.
And if you are not that lucky, then you will need microscope and lots of patience. Or send me if you located in uk and ill have a look at it free of charge. Just you funding postages both ways ;)
