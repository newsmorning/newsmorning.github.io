In this article, we'll discuss 5 genius hacks to fix high CPU Usage in Safe Mode.

What is Safe Mode?

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode that boots your computer with only essential programs and drivers. It's a powerful tool that allows you to diagnose problems with your computer. Safe Mode is especially useful when dealing with viruses, system errors, and high CPU Usage.

Hack #1: Uninstall Unnecessary Programs

Unused or unnecessary programs can contribute to high CPU usage. To fix this, boot your computer in Safe Mode and uninstall unused programs. Open the Control Panel, navigate to Programs and Features, and remove programs that you no longer use.

Hack #2: Scan for Viruses and Malware

Viruses and malware can cause high CPU Usage. These malicious programs are designed to run in the background without your knowledge, slowing down your computer. Boot your computer in Safe Mode and scan your computer for viruses and malware using your antivirus program. If you don't have an antivirus, download and install one.

Hack #3: Disable Start-Up Programs

Start-up programs can contribute to high CPU Usage. When you boot your computer, these programs run in the background, using up precious processing power. To fix this, boot your computer in Safe Mode and disable start-up programs. Open the Task Manager, navigate to the Startup tab, and disable programs that you don't need.

Hack #4: Check for Windows Updates

Windows updates can fix bugs and optimize your computer's performance. Boot your computer in Safe Mode and check for Windows updates. Open the Settings app, navigate to Update & Security, and click on Check for Updates.

But, based on some reports, this isn’t the case for some users. They’ve experienced high CPU usage even in Safe mode.
 
Since we’re probably looking at a grave system issue, there are some advanced troubleshooting steps you’ll need to take. The list is below so give them a shot and tell us whether they helped you or not.
 
## What to do if CPU is at 100% even in Safe mode
 
### Solution 1 – Check the hardware
 
Let’s start with the hardware. If the problem was present only during the normal startup, we would completely focus attention towards the software. However, since it appears in the Safe mode, the mode where only the essential drivers and applications are loaded, we must encourage you to inspect hardware as well.
 
First, make sure that everything is properly connected, that your CPU or GPU aren’t overheating. Make sure to remove and plug-in RAM cards in their respective slots. Also, if you’ve changed your motherboard, disconnect and reconnect everything. Finally, make sure that the HDD is plugged in properly.

### Solution 2 – Check the drivers
 
Now, after we can safely claim that the hardware isn’t causing abnormally high CPU activity, let’s move to the software part. Making sure that both your drivers and BIOS are up to date.
 
A faulty driver is in the direct connection to many hardware issues, as even the best hardware won’t perform as intended without the proper software support.
 
For that reason, we suggest checking all drivers and confirming that all are up to date. Also, it’s strongly advised to avoid the generic drivers provided by Windows Update for certain devices, especially the GPU. Make sure to visit the OEM’s official website and get the latest drivers installed.
 
An easier and more convenient solution would be to use a trusted third-party program that downloads and installs the latest drivers for Windows automatically. With an in-built download manager, the program will get the updates directly from the software, so you won’t have to open your browser.
 
We recommend this type of tool because it has powerful capabilities, including fixing corrupt drivers and providing robust reports about each driver after performing complex scans.
 
### Solution 3 – Scan for malware
 
Presence of malicious software can be another reason why your CPU spikes to 100% even in the Safe mode. Malware comes in different shapes and colors, and some of them might use your system resources for mining cryptocurrency and similar backdoor activities.
 
Most of the time, the generic drivers for your PC’s hardware and peripherals are not properly updated by the system. There are key differences between a generic driver and a manufacturer’s driver.Searching for the right driver version for each of your hardware components can become tedious. That’s why an automated assistant can help you find and update your system with the correct drivers every time, and we strongly recommend DriverFix. Here’s how to do it:
 
- Download and install DriverFix.
 - Launch the software.
 - Wait for the detection of all your faulty drivers.
 - DriverFix will now show you all the drivers that have issues, and you just need to select the ones you’d liked fixed.
 - Wait for the app to download and install the newest drivers.
 - Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

### DriverFix
 
 Keep your PC components drivers working perfectly without putting your PC at risk.

 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

That’s why it’s of utmost importance to have an up-to-date protection, either Windows Defender or a third-party antivirus.
 
For this kind of issues, we suggest performing a deep scan to get rid completely of the menacing malware presence. If you’re using Windows Defender, follow these steps to perform a deep scan:
 
- Open Windows Defender from the taskbar notification area.
 - Choose Virus & threat protection.
 - Choose Scan options.
 - Select Windows Defender Offline Scan.
 - Click Scan now.
 - Your PC will restart and the scanning process will commence.

 
### Solution 4 – Run SFC, DISM, and ChkDsk
 
Another possible reason for the resource leakage might lie in the corruption of the essential system files. That’s why we suggest running System File Checker and Deployment Image Servicing and Management to resolve possible corruption of system files. These tools work in a similar manner, but the best way to utilize them is when running in succession.
 
The same goes for the corrupt sectors in the HDD. If you’re HDD takes too much time to boot the system, the CPU might suffer. For that reason, we suggest using another system utility via the elevated Command Prompt.
 
Here’s how to run SFC and DISM, and then ChkDsk in Windows 10:
 
- In the Windows Search bar, type cmd. Right-click click on Command Prompt and run it as admin.
 - In the command-line, type sfc/scannow and press Enter.
 - After its done, type the following command and press Enter after each:
 - DISM /online /Cleanup-Image / ScanHealth
 - DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
 - When the procedure ends, restart your PC.

 
### Solution 6 – Reinstall Windows 10
 
Finally, if you’re still experiencing high CPU usage, even when in the Safe mode, we suggest reinstalling the system. Moreover, the best step would be to completely format all drives and start from scratch. Of course, don’t forget to backup your data accordingly.
 
- DISM /online /Cleanup-Image / ScanHealth
 - DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

 
For this operation, you’ll be needing a USB flash drive with at least 6 GB. Also, you’ll need to download the Media Creation Tool and create the bootable drive.
