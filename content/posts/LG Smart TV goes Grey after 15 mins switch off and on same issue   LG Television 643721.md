Is Your LG Smart TV Going Grey After Just 15 Minutes? Find Out How To Fix This Annoying Issue!

LG Smart TVs have revolutionized the way we watch television with their advanced picture quality and smart features. However, certain users have recently reported an annoying issue with their LG Smart TVs turning grey after just 15 minutes. This problem can be frustrating for users, but there is a solution. In this article, we will explore some simple steps that can help you fix this issue and enjoy uninterrupted viewing.

Firstly, there are a few things you can do to minimize the occurrence of this issue. One of the main reasons your LG Smart TV may be turning grey after 15 minutes is due to overheating. You can prevent this by ensuring that your TV has enough ventilation and is not kept in a tight, closed space. It is recommended that you place your TV in a well-ventilated area or use a stand that elevates the TV so that air can circulate around it.

Another possible reason for the grey screen could be a loose display cable. Check if the cable connecting your TV and the display is fully plugged into the port. If the connection is loose, reinsert the cable and check if this resolves the issue.

If the problem still persists, try resetting the TV. This can help to clear any temporary issues with the TV’s software. To reset your LG Smart TV, you can simply unplug the power cord and leave it unplugged for a few minutes. After this, plug it back in and turn on the TV. This should reset the TV and hopefully fix the grey screen issue.

You can also try updating your TV firmware to the latest version. To check for updates, go to the settings menu on your TV and navigate to ‘General’. From there, select ‘About This TV’ and click on ‘Check for Updates’. This will automatically scan for any available updates and install them if necessary.

In some cases, the grey screen issue may be due to a hardware fault in the TV’s display. If this is the case, it may be necessary to seek professional help to fix it. LG offers a range of customer support services for their Smart TVs, including a customer service helpline and support page. You can also contact local TV repair professionals for assistance.

In conclusion, if your LG Smart TV is turning grey after just 15 minutes, there are several ways to fix the issue. Begin by ensuring proper ventilation, checking the display cable for loose connections, resetting the TV, and updating the firmware. If none of these solutions works, seek professional help to diagnose and fix the hardware problem. Remember to always follow safe practices when handling electrical devices and seek professional help when necessary. By employing these measures, you can enjoy uninterrupted viewing on your LG Smart TV.

Every 15 minutes or so the screen turns grey. Can still hear the program but cannot see. To fix required to turn tv off and back on. Good for another 15 minutes or so then back to grey vertical bars.
Suggestions as to how to fix appreciated.

 @david_ph1 intermittent errors like the one you are describing are a big PITA :-). The issue here could be the T-con board or the Main board. Remove the back of your TV and take a look at the boards. See if there are any components that may look discolored or "odd". Post some pictures of those with your QUESTION. The other thing you can try is to use some freeze spray. If your TV starts acting out spray some of it on the T-con board and see if that resolves it temporarily. If not try the same with your main board. Again, we may have a more precise answer when we see more of what your boards look like etc.
Be careful not to touch anything with your bare fingers while you work on your TV since that might be a shocking experience :-)
