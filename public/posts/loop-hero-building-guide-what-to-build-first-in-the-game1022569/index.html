Do you feel like you are not making any progress, no matter how hard you try? If this sounds familiar, then read on as we present to you our Ultimate Building Guide to help you revamp your gaming strategy.\nLoop Hero is an exciting game where you must build a loop by placing different cards on a grid. This game requires strategic planning and careful attention to detail to succeed. In this guide, we will give you valuable tips to help you build a strong loop and progress through the game.\nChoosing the right cards The cards that you choose to place in your loop can make all the difference in succeeding in the game. The right cards can provide you with valuable resources, while the wrong cards can hinder your progress. It is essential to understand the different types of cards and how they function.\nFor example, the Meadow card generates HP for the hero and has a high chance of spawning a Blood clot card, which provides additional resources. The Blood Grove card, on the other hand, generates a powerful enemy after every three kills. It is important to understand how these cards work and place them strategically.\nComplementary card placement Placing cards close to each other can provide valuable bonuses that can help you succeed in the game. For instance, if you place multiple Mountain cards near each other, they will provide you with additional HP for your hero. It is important to pay attention to the different types of cards that work well together.\nEfficient resource management Effective resource management is essential in Loop Hero. Placing cards that generate resources such as food, wood, and stone, can help you build new structures and level up faster. Understanding how to efficiently manage your resources will help you progress much faster in the game.\nExperiment with different card combos Finally, don’t be afraid to experiment with different card combinations. Loop Hero has an incredible variety of cards, and the possibilities are endless. Trying new card combinations can help you find the perfect strategy that works for you.\nIn conclusion, with these valuable tips, you can revamp your Loop Hero strategy and progress through the game faster than ever before. Remember to choose the right cards, place them strategically, manage your resources efficiently, and experiment with new card combinations. By implementing these tips, you will be on your way to becoming a pro in no time.\nKnowing what to build first in Loop Hero is important because it can set the tone for how your game will turn out to be. Although the core of the game is simple, there are many unexplained things in this strategic RPG game which can make players confused. Mainly, how do you get started with your buildings? The number of Cards and their benefits can be overwhelming if you don’t know which direction to head into. Don’t worry, this guide will help you begin on the right track that you can try out. It’s not the only way to go about it but it’s one way to get you started.\nWhat to Build First in Loop Hero? You can start off by building the Herbalist’s Hut first primarily because you can get Healing Potions in the game. When you take on different enemies or bosses, you may end up dying if you don’t have access to Potions so Herbalist’s Hut will come in handy and heal your health when you need it. You need 2 Preserved Wood, 3 Preserved Stone and 4 Food Supplies to build a Herbalist’s Hut. The Potions will even recharge when you pass the camp in your loop. As the Hero, you have the ensure that you don’t die so you can return to camp if you think you are not going to make it.\nRogue Class Next, you can build the Field Kitchen because it will increase your healing by 10% each time you pass the cozy camp. You need 3 Preserved Wood, 2 Preserved Stone and 1 Food Supply to make the Field Kitchen in Loop Hero. Focus on this building as a priority if you are playing as the Rogue class. You can also build the Refuge which needs 12 Preserved Wood, 4 Stable Metal, 2 Preserved Stone and 7 Food Supplies. Also keep the Smithy in mind if you are confused about which other structure to build early on in the game.\nNecromancer Class The next building to construct can be Field Kitchen as well and after getting the Field Kitchen, you can build the Gymnasium. It will give you special traits or bonus abilities when you kill a certain number of enemies. You will need 2 Stable wood, 6 Stable Metal, 3 Preserved Rock and 1 Metamorphosis to unlock the Gymnasium. After the Gym, create a Cemetery which needs 14 Preserved Stone, 4 Stable Wood and 2 Stable Metal. After that, go ahead and build the Crypt which requires 4 Stable Wood, 9 Stable Metal, 16 Preserved Stone and 1 Orb of Expansion. This is particularly useful for the Necromancer.\nSo those are all the constructions you can get started with in this game. With these suggestions, you can try out your own ideas and see how your experience changes along the way. No matter what you choose, though, the game is going to be addictive!\nThat’s all about what to build first in Loop Hero.
