# Devastating News: Acer Aspire 5253 Refuses to Turn On - Is all Hope Lost?!

As a proud owner of an Acer Aspire 5253 laptop, it was quite a shock when it stopped turning on. One day, it worked just fine, and the next day, it refused to come to life. With no logical explanation as to why this happened, I found myself in a state of panic, wondering if all hope was lost.

For those who own an Acer Aspire 5253 laptop, you may know that it is a reliable machine that offers a perfect balance of speed, storage, and graphic quality. However, when such a powerful device fails to turn on, it can be frustrating and confusing.

At first, I thought it was a battery issue, and that maybe my laptop had run out of power. So, I plugged in the charger and waited for it to turn on, but nothing happened. I tried different outlets, different chargers, but still, no response. This led me to believe it was an issue with the power source, but I soon came to find out that it was much more complicated than that.

The next step was to open up the laptop and check if there was any physical damage to the internal components. After removing the battery and the RAM, I found no visible signs of damage or corrosion. This meant that the issue was not a hardware problem, but instead, it was something buried deep within the software.

At this point, I was feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, with no idea of what to do next. However, after some research and advice from fellow Acer Aspire 5253 owners, I discovered that the issue could be resolved by performing a hard reset.

To do this, I removed the battery and held down the power button for thirty seconds. After releasing the button, I placed the battery back in and attempted to turn on the laptop. To my surprise, it worked! The screen came to life, and the laptop powered on without any issues.

In conclusion, the Acer Aspire 5253 is a reliable laptop that can face a few issues from time to time. However, there is always a solution to every problem, and in this case, it was a simple hard reset. Before taking your Acer Aspire 5253 to a repair shop or considering buying a new laptop, try performing a hard reset and see if it solves the problem. Remember, hope is never lost!

## Chosen Solution
 My laptop wont turn on.

 If your Acer Aspire laptop won’t turn on, use the Acer Aspire 5253 Won’t Turn On problem page for possible causes and solutions.
I will now kindly ask you to remove and reinsert the RAM DIMMS and the CMOS battery, I'm trying to isolate the problem here. You can follow this easy guide to get to those components. Take out the RAM, put it back in, make sure it's secured properly. Do the same with the small coin-cell battery to the left of the RAM, just leave it out a little longer before reassembly (like, I don't know, 5 minutes) then short the contacts on the socket it was seated in (the + and the -).
