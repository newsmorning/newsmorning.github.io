Sound is a crucial part of your Windows experience. Needless to say, if Windows volume is too low despite your volume slider reaching 100, you know there is something wrong. That being said, a low PC volume isn’t something that can’t be fixed. Here are some of the best ways to fix low volume on a Windows PC.
 
## How To Fix Low Audio Issues in Windows 11/ 10- Best Methods
 
### 1. Use Audio Troubleshooter
 
Windows offers an inbuilt troubleshooter that may help you fix the issue without much effort. The Audio Troubleshooter can help detect the issue automatically and suggest a fix accordingly. Here are the steps to use the Audio Troubleshooter –
 
- Open Settings by pressing Windows + I.
 - From the left-hand side select System(if not already selected).
 - From the right-hand side, click on Troubleshoot.

 

 
- Click on Other troubleshooters.

 
- Under Most frequentclick on the Run button next to Playing Audio as shown in the screenshot below.

 
### 2. Increase Media Player Sound And Sound of Apps
 
In many cases when you play an audio track especially if you are using a third-party media player, you are effectively dealing with two audio levels. The first is the volume of your PC’s speakers and the second, is your Media Player’s volume. Here, you can check the volume levels of your Media Player and increase them, if they are low.
 
My Windows audio was working just fine, but as soon as I connected to a Skype meeting, the volume was very low. I could hardly listen to others. Despite increasing the system volume by pushing the volume slider to the right, the volume still remained muffled.
 
In the above-mentioned case, it could be that your Windows volume is not low per se, but the specific app has a low volume. For this, you can even refer to Windows’ Volume Mixer and check the audio levels as shown in the screenshot below. For this –
 
- Open Settings by pressing Windows + I.
 - From the right, click on Sound.

 
- Scroll down until you reach Advanced, and click on Volume Mixer.

 
 
 
- Under Apps increase the volume levels of the app where you are facing low volume issues.

 
### 3. Check Sound- Related Settings
 
You might be facing low volume on a variety of fronts –
 
- It could be that the overall volume of your laptop is low.
 - Maybe the overall volume is quite audible, but as soon as you plug in the microphone, the audio becomes very low.
 - Or, it could be that as soon as you plug in external speakers via jack or Bluetooth, the audio is very low.

 
Whatever might be the case –
 
- Open Settingsby pressing Windows + I  key combination.
 - Click on System from the left-hand side (if not already selected).
 - From the right-hand side, click on Sound,which should be the second option.
 - The Soundsection can be divided into three parts – Output, Input, and Advanced.

 
- Click on each option and tweak the volume slider (if needed).

 
After you have tweaked each of the volume sliders under each of the options, now check if the volume is as per your liking or not.
 
### 4. Use A Third-Party Equilizer
 
While you resolve the issue at hand, in the meantime, you can use a third-party equalizer like Boom 3D. It is one of the best apps that can help improve sound playback, thanks to the wide variety of customizable settings that it comes with.

### 5. Reinstall Audio Driver
 
You may face low audio issues because of an outdated or corrupt audio driver. There are two ways in which you can update audio drivers. One way is to update drivers manually. And, the second method is more effortless and risk-free- you can use a third-party driver updater tool like Advanced Driver Updater.
 
### What is Advanced Driver Updater? And, Why Use Advanced Driver Updater?
 
Advanced Driver Updater is a leading easy-to-use driver updater utility for Windows. It helps scan your computer for outdated drivers and helps update them.
