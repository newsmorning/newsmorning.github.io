### Deal Flow Explained
 
Deal flow explains the flow of investment pitches and business opportunities that demand investments in return for profits for investors. It is not a quantitative measure but rather a qualitative measure of economic conditions. The quality of deals that flow from entrepreneurs and businesses towards investors such as venture capitalists, seed, or angel investors reflects good or bad investments.
 
Qualitative deals’ inflow indicates how successful earlier ventures and investments were for its stakeholder and older investors. Thus, it helps new or potential investors to estimate their future return on investments (ROI). 
 
For instance, a firm of venture capitalists will have a separate team to source and gather deals and another team that chooses the most profitable deals for investment purposes. However, the first step is deal origination or deal sourcing. For this, dealmakers or venture capitalists use their networks and referrals. Subsequently, they network through deal flow events or outsource profitable leads from agencies or online platforms to bid for deals with the highest returns. 
 
Similarly, relationship management and regular communication with brokers and sales professionals help a real estate investor to get insights about projects or proposals and lead to high-quality deal flow. Although, while investing in real estate, an investor should know that it is not a get-quick-rich scheme. The accumulation of wealth and profits from real-estate ventures and holdings take years.
 
For investment bankers, deal flow management requires the facilitation of corporate takeovers and big-ticket deals amongst businesses and companies for mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Therefore, investment bankers have a comparatively high degree and in-depth knowledge of various business domains and markets to wisely make investment and divestment decisions.
 
Thus, businesses tend to source, evaluate and close investment deals through private equity to allow firms and companies to maintain their deal flow pipeline.

Thus, successfully closing deals in a new field requires investors to gain knowledge about the markets and expect realistic returns.

- Sourcing referrals and pitches from other investors,A referral from portfolio companies results in higher chances of closing profitable deals.

### Example
 
Let us look at an example to establish the deal flow meaning by understanding a practical situation, 
 
For instance, the onset of the pandemic in 2020 and its spiraling effects on the economy were visible through stock markets plunging and investors turning away from acquisitions. Consequently, an event like the COVID-19 pandemic led investors to focus and shore up their existing investments to increase their returns on investment. 
 
Thus, the developing economic scenario led to the drying up deal flow pipeline as investors stayed away from new investments. 
 
However, as Forbes reported in May 2021, it soon mitigated this industry-wide danger of withering of deal flows. Globally in 2021, a record $1.77 trillion worth of merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions took place in the first four months. According to reports, it was a whopping 124% rise compared to a low-lying pandemic year and 10% higher than any first four months of any other year. 
 
According to analysts, this increased search for yields and returns by investors resulted from extremely low-interest rates and comparatively large capital holding with investors. Additionally, low interest, increased government stimulus, and the excessive liquidity in the hands of investors led to further propping up of the public equity markets. Thus, a surging stock market led to an increase in people’s confidence. 
 
Such a cyclical scenario was more profound in the American economy, wherein the initial four months of 2021, M&A transactions worth $1 trillion had already occurred.
