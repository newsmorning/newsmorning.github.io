If you're experiencing slow performance on your Windows 11 computer, high CPU usage by the audiodg.exe process could be the culprit. This process is responsible for managing audio inputs and outputs and can, at times, use a lot of system resources. Here's how to fix the issue quickly and get your computer running smoothly again.

Step 1: Check Task Manager

The first step is to open Task Manager to see if audiodg.exe is indeed causing high CPU usage. To do this, right-click on the taskbar, select Task Manager, and look for the audiodg.exe process in the CPU column. If it's using a lot of CPU, continue to step two.

Step 2: Disable Audio Enhancements

Audio enhancements are a set of features that can improve sound quality, but they can also cause audiodg.exe to use a lot of system resources. To turn them off, right-click on the speaker icon in the system tray and select Sounds. Click on the Playback tab, select your default audio device, and click on Properties. In the Enhancements tab, uncheck all the options and click Apply.

Step 3: Disable Exclusive Mode

Exclusive mode allows applications to take full control of an audio device, which can cause issues with audiodg.exe. To turn it off, click on the Advanced tab in the Properties window and uncheck the "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device" option.

Step 4: Restart the Windows Audio Service

Finally, if none of the above solutions work, restarting the Windows Audio Service might do the trick. To do this, open the Services app by pressing Windows key + R and typing "services.msc" in the Run dialog box. Look for the Windows Audio Service, right-click on it, and select Restart.

Conclusion

Audiodg.exe is an essential process in Windows 11, but it can cause high CPU usage and slow down your computer. By following the steps above, you can quickly fix the issue and get your computer running smoothly again. Remember to check Task Manager regularly for any other processes that might be causing performance issues.

This very fact keeps you from terminating these processes. One of these, the audiodg.exe, is often found to be using a high CPU.
 
Whenever a process or program starts consuming extensive resources, it’s bound to downgrade the system’s performance and lead to lagging issues. 
 
This will cause the apps to crash and even lead to a complete shutdown in the worst case. Do go through our guide on how to speed up your Windows 11 PC and prevent that from happening.
 
If the audiodg.exe is using a high CPU, rest assured the problem is easily fixable. But before we head to that, let’s first understand what the process is all about.
 
### Why is the audiodg.exe process consuming high CPU?
 
The audiodg.exe or the Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation process plays a critical role in audio enhancement, apart from digital signal processing. 
 
It’s isolated from the Windows Audio service to allow hardware producers to use their own enhancement service. Isolating reduces the likelihood of conflicts and prevents the OS from crashing.
 
The process is configured to run in the background for the best audio output. However, it’s found to be consuming high CPU values at times. This could be due to one or more of the following reasons:
 
- Running an outdated version of the sound card driver
 - Enhanced audio effects
 - Malfunctioning external peripherals

 
After understanding the underlying causes, you are in a far better position to start troubleshooting the audiodg.exe high CPU error. Let’s now walk you through the most effective fixes.
 
## What can I do if Windows 11’s audiodg.exe is using a high CPU?
 
### 1. Remove external peripherals
 
Your primary approach when dealing with high CPU usage by audiodg.exe is to remove any external microphones or headsets. After disconnecting, verify if the resource consumption changes. 
 
If it does, reconnect the peripheral and check the effects. In case the CPU usage continues to be under normal levels, the error is fixed. 
 
But if it spikes again, the issue most likely lies with the device or its configured settings. In which case, try the methods listed below and if they don’t work, replace the device itself. Also, check our curated list of headphones, in case you plan to purchase one.
 
### 3. Disable audio enhancements
 
- Press Windows + S to launch the Search menu. Enter Change system sounds in the text field at the top, and click on the relevant search result that appears.
 - Navigate to the Playback tab in the Sound window.
 - Right-click on the device currently in use, and select Properties from the context menu.
 - Now, navigate to the Enhancement tab in the Speaker Properties window, tick the checkbox for Disable all enhancements, and click on OK at the bottom to save the changes.

 
### 4. Reduce the audio sample rate
 
- Press Windows + S to launch the Search menu. Enter Change system sounds in the text field at the top, and click on the relevant search result that appears.
 - Go to the Playback tab from the top.
 - Right-click on the currently used speaker and select Properties from the context menu.
 - Next, navigate to the Advanced tab from the top in the Properties window.
 - Click on the Sample rate dropdown menu and select a lower value from the ones listed.
 - Click on OK to save the changes and close the window.

 
A higher sample rate will consume more system resources, thus leading to the high CPU usage by the audiodg.exe process. Therefore, reducing the sample rate can work as an effective fix. 
 
### 2. Update drivers (both sound card and devices)
 
- Press Windows + S to launch the Search menu. Enter Device Manager in the text field at the top, and click on the relevant search result that appears.
 - Locate and double-click on the Sound, video, and game controllers entry.
 - Right-click on the sound card, and select Update driver from the context menu.
 - Select Search automatically for drivers from the two options that appear in the Update Drivers window.
 - Windows will now scan for the best available drivers on your system and install it.

 
Running an outdated driver is also known to cause high CPU usage by the audiodg.exe process. This can be resolved by updating the driver to the latest version. Though Windows takes care of the updates, there’s no harm in checking for it manually.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

The Device Manager method listed above only looks for newer driver versions on the computer, thus acting as an offline update. 
 
If you don’t remember downloading it or Windows is unable to find one, you can always look for the latest driver version in Windows Update or download it from the manufacturer’s website.
 
Similarly, update the drivers for the external audio devices connected to the PC. In case that sounds like too much trouble, you can always go with a third-party app. We recommend using DriverFix, a dedicated tool that will scan the web for updates and keep the installed drivers up-to-date.
 
In case your speakers don’t support other sample rates, skip this method and head to the next one.
 
### 5. Disable volume adjustment
 
- Press Windows + S to launch the Search menu. Enter Change system sounds in the text field on the top and click on the relevant search result that appears.
 - Navigate to the Communications tab from the top.
 - Next, select the Do nothing option and click on OK to save the changes.
