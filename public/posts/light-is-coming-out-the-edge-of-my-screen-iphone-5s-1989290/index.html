The iPhone 5S, which was released by Apple in 2013, has been one of the most successful smartphones in history, with millions of units sold worldwide. However, recent reports by tech experts suggest that there might be something more to the phone’s construction than previously thought. It appears that the iPhone 5S emits light from the edge of the screen, a discovery that has caused many to ask the question: What is Apple hiding?\nThe discovery The discovery that the iPhone 5S emits light from the edge of the screen was first made by a group of tech experts who were carrying out an experiment on the phone. They noticed that the phone was emitting light from its edges even when the screen was turned off. This discovery has caused many to question what is happening inside the iPhone 5S and what it means for the device.\nThe implications The implications of this discovery are significant for a number of reasons. First, it suggests that there might be more going on inside the iPhone 5S than was previously thought. Second, it raises questions about the safety and security of the device, particularly in terms of its ability to protect users from harmful radiation.\nWhat is Apple hiding? The question that many are asking is what Apple is hiding. While some speculate that the light emitting from the edge of the screen may be a sign of a hidden feature, others believe that it could be something more sinister. Some have suggested that Apple may be using the light emission as a way to track users or collect data about them. Others have suggested that it could be a sign of Apple’s commitment to green technology, as the company may be using the light to harvest energy from the device.\nThe Apple response Apple has not yet responded to the discovery of the light emission from the iPhone 5S. However, given the level of interest in the device and the questions that are being raised, it is likely that the company will issue a statement soon. In the meantime, users of the iPhone 5S are advised to proceed with caution and keep a close eye on their device.\nConclusion The discovery that the iPhone 5S emits light from the edge of the screen is a shocking one, and it raises a number of important questions about the device and its safety. While it is not yet clear what Apple is hiding, it is clear that there is more going on inside the iPhone 5S than was previously known. As more information becomes available, it will be interesting to see how this discovery impacts the reputation of Apple and the iPhone 5S.\nChosen Solution I am not the most careful with my phone and have dropped it quite a few times but have a case and a screen protector on it so no extreme damage has been done. Recently I dropped my phone and now in the top right hand corner there is light coming out from under the screen and when I press down on the screen in that area it makes a pop/clicking sound. What do I need to do to make these problems stop?\nThe glue adhesive has give. It never was that great and alway was very susceptible at that corner on the 5S. only option would be to try and get some glue in there and then clamp it down until it sets. Normal superglue won’t last long but I recommend glue called E8000. It has a superfine nozzle that will allow you to get in there and apply some without taking the screen off. However you will have to clamp it with some plastic market stall type clamps at that corner after gluing as it takes 24hrs for a full bond . If you leave it as is then dust wil get into your camera and it wil maybe also just fall off completely so best to get it done as soon as possible\nThis is a common issue, the adhesive between the glass and plastic frame has come loose and separating. A screen replacement will be a straight forward solution, but if you’d like a “quick fix” just get a small amount of super glue on a toothpick and apply a bit between the glass and plastic frame. Make sure not to adhere the screen assembly frame to the metal housing of the phone.\n","wordCount":"756","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mario Anschutz"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/light-is-coming-out-the-edge-of-my-screen-iphone-5s-1989290/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Shocking Discovery: iPhone 5S emits light from the edge of the screen - What is Apple hiding?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 16, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;756 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mario Anschutz</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-discovery>The discovery</a></li><li><a href=#the-implications>The implications</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-apple-hiding>What is Apple hiding?</a></li><li><a href=#the-apple-response>The Apple response</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=shocking-discovery-iphone-5s-emits-light-from-the-edge-of-the-screen---what-is-apple-hiding>Shocking Discovery: iPhone 5S emits light from the edge of the screen - What is Apple hiding?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shocking-discovery-iphone-5s-emits-light-from-the-edge-of-the-screen---what-is-apple-hiding>#</a></h1><p>The iPhone 5S, which was released by Apple in 2013, has been one of the most successful smartphones in history, with millions of units sold worldwide.
