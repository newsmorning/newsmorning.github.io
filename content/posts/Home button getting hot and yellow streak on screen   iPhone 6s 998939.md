## Chosen Solution
 I'm attempting to repair This iphone, it's not crucial that its fixed but would be nice. It has an issue where it appears to have a yellow streak drawn across the sceen from the bottom left corner to the upper right, as well as the home button getting hot. Apparently the phone sat in a dry cooler for a number of hours outside and afterwards these issues were noticed, so its presumed that its due to either humidity in the cooler or from heat in the cooler. It also registers there being a headphone jack inserted even when it is not and occasionally locks up and reboots, but otherwise works ok. Anyone have any suggestions? I've got the phone opened up and can't see any issues like battery swelling or water ingress causing corrosion.

 Try and putting a new LCD on. It may resolve the yellow lines (bad LCD). Some new screens come with a new home button. (Touch ID may not work, but taking it to apple they will fix that part).
