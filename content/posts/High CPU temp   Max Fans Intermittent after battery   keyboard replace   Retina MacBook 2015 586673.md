Is Your MacBook On the Verge of Overheating? Discover the Surprising Cause Behind High CPU Temp and Intermittent Max Fans After Battery and Keyboard Replacement

If you are a proud owner of an Apple MacBook, you know the importance of keeping your device in tiptop condition. As a premium laptop, the MacBook is built to deliver exceptional performance and reliability, but even the best gadgets can fall victim to wear and tear after prolonged use.

If you’ve recently replaced your MacBook’s battery or keyboard and have noticed unusual behavior, such as high CPU temperature and intermittent max fans, you may wonder what’s behind these issues. Luckily, there is a surprising cause that you can easily rectify, so you can enjoy your MacBook’s impressive features without any hiccups.

The Surprising Cause Behind High CPU Temp and Intermittent Max Fans

The root of the problem lies with a small but critical component called the thermal sensor. Apple designed the thermal sensor to monitor the temperature of your MacBook’s internal components and manage the fan speed accordingly. When the fan runs at full speed, it works to dissipate heat from the processor, graphics card, and other components to prevent overheating, which can cause permanent damage to your MacBook.

However, when you replace the battery or keyboard, you inadvertently disconnect the thermal sensor from the MacBook’s logic board. Since the thermal sensor is no longer connected, it fails to register the temperature changes, and the fan runs uncontrollably at maximum speed, even when the MacBook is idle. This leads to high CPU temperature, and you may hear your fan spinning at full speed. Your MacBook may even shut down automatically to avoid damage caused by overheating.

How to Fix the Problem

While these symptoms might seem scary and frustrating, there’s a quick fix that doesn’t require a genius bar visit or an expensive repair job. All you have to do is reconnect the thermal sensor cable to the logic board. This can be done easily by following a few simple steps:

1. Power off your MacBook and remove the battery.

2. Remove the bottom case of your MacBook.

3. Locate the thermal sensor cable and connect it to the logic board. You may need a special tool to remove the connector.

4. Reassemble your MacBook and power it on.

Now, the thermal sensor will be reconnected to the logic board, and your fan will work at different speeds based on the temperature of the internal components, bringing down the CPU temperature and reducing fan noise significantly.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you’ve recently replaced your MacBook’s battery or keyboard, and your device has been running hotter than usual, the thermal sensor may be the culprit. By simply reconnecting the thermal sensor cable to the logic board, you can fix the issue and avoid further damage to your MacBook. Remember to follow the steps carefully and exercise caution when handling internal components. With this simple fix, you can enjoy the full performance of your MacBook without any overheating or fan noise problems.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi Everyone,
I recently replaced a battery and a keyboard in a MacBook 2015 Pro and having issues with it randomly going to 100c and max fans as well. Mainly at bootup.
Ran Apple Hardware Test and reported no issues.
Nothing running that could cause it to heat up that much. Even going into the Apple Hardware Test it would rev up even before running the tests.
There wasn't this issue before replacing the parts that I'm aware of.
Any ideas on what could be the issue?

 I don't see the fan in your capture, that's important too! But we need to see all of this during the time things are struggling. For now I think we have a good enough clue on what's happening.
We can see the high water marks (the lines) which tells me the system has encountered time points when the processing load was quite heavy! I think your issue is likely a very full drive and/or running too many tasks concurrently.
So lets get a better idea on whats happening under the covers!
Look at your drive size and how much is free (unused) you want to have between 1/4 and 1/3 unused. If you don't do a good clean up getting rid of old stuff or back it up.
Next, the next time things get rough, open up Activity Monitor its in your Application/Utilities folder click on the CPU button and % CPU column so the most used is on the top, see what processes (apps) are running hard. Compare it to when things are normal thats what you need to drill down on what these processes are doing.
