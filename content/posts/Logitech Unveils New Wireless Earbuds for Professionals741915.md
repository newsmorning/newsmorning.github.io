# Revolutionize Your Workday with Logitech's Next-Level Wireless Earbuds for Productivity Pros!

Are you tired of getting tangled up in your headphone cords while trying to work? Do you want to cut the cords and go wireless, but still need to stay productive? Logitech's new wireless earbuds might just be the solution you've been looking for!

Logitech's next-level wireless earbuds are designed with productivity in mind. They have been optimized for voice recognition and crystal-clear audio quality, so you can make phone calls or attend virtual meetings without any interruptions or background noise. And they come with a range of features that can help you get more done in less time.

First and foremost, Logitech's earbuds keep you connected on the go. They connect seamlessly to your device via Bluetooth, so you can easily switch between your phone and computer without missing a beat. They also come with a USB-C charging case that provides up to 25 hours of battery life, giving you enough power to stay connected all day long.

But that's just the beginning. Logitech's earbuds also come with intuitive touch controls that allow you to take calls, play music, and activate your virtual assistant with the touch of a button. You can even customize the controls to suit your needs, so you can access your most frequently used features without having to take your eyes off your work.

For those who need to block out distractions, Logitech's earbuds also come with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology. This feature uses advanced algorithms to analyze and cancel out background noise, allowing you to focus on your work and tune out the rest of the world. And if you need to stay aware of your surroundings, there's a transparency mode that lets you hear outside sounds while still enjoying your music.

Logitech's earbuds are also designed with comfort in mind. They come with a range of different ear tips and wings, so you can find the perfect fit for your ears. And they're so lightweight that you'll barely even notice them in your ears.

But perhaps the best thing about Logitech's next-level wireless earbuds is that they're designed to keep you productive. Whether you need to take calls, attend virtual meetings, listen to music, or just focus on your work, these earbuds have everything you need to stay on top of your game. So why not give them a try and see how they can revolutionize your workday?

Logitech has unveiled a new line of wireless earbuds, the Zone True Wireless and Zone Wired Earbuds, aimed at business people who spend a lot of time making video calls as they work remotely.

 

The company claims its new products are the first to be certified by the major video conferencing platforms—Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. The earbuds come at an opportune time when more professionals are embracing remote work and hybrid environments.

 

The Zone True Wireless earbuds promise users a comfortable shape with high-level audio. The wireless earbuds come with a noise-canceling mic and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) that allow for high-quality calls regardless of loud background noise, claims the company.

 

Logitech later goes on to say the earbuds have “double the battery of leading devices." Its lithium ion battery provides an estimated duration of six hours with ANC on and six hours, 30 minutes with ANC off if they're used to talk. If just used to listen, battery life extends to nine hours with ANC and 12 hours with ANC off. It takes 2 hours and 45 minutes to fully recharge the wireless earbuds.

 

The Zone True Wireless earbuds support Bluetooth and USB receivers, so they'll work with the majority of smartphones and computers and allow users to easily jump between devices.

 

The Zone Wired Earbuds also have the same noise canceling mic and Active Noise Cancellation features, as well as the same audio quality. They can connect to your computer or smartphone via USB-A, USB-C, or the standard 3.5mm headphone jack.

 

Logitech's new wireless earbuds come in Graphite and Rose Pink, but there's no confirmation on the color of the wired earbuds. The Zone True Wireless and the Zone Wired Earbuds launch later this fall for $299 and $99, respectively, with the Rose Pink wireless earbuds being exclusive to Logitech’s website.
