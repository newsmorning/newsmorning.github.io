# Find out which version of the Asus Chromebook C201 you own - you won't believe the differences!

If you've recently purchased an Asus Chromebook C201 or are looking to buy one, you may be unaware that there are actually two different versions of this popular laptop. While they might look the same at first glance, the differences between the two models can have a significant impact on your user experience.

So, how do you tell which version of the Asus Chromebook C201 you own? The easiest way is to check the model number, which can be found on the bottom of the laptop. The first generation of the Asus Chromebook C201 has a model number of C201PA-DS01, while the second generation has a model number of C201PA-DS02.

Here are some of the key differences between the two models:

## Processor

One of the most significant changes between the two versions of the Asus Chromebook C201 is the processor. The first generation uses a Rockchip 3288-C quad-core processor, while the second generation uses a Rockchip RK3399 hexa-core processor. This means that the second generation is significantly faster and more powerful than the first.

## Storage

The first generation of the Asus Chromebook C201 comes with 16GB of storage, while the second generation comes with 32GB. While this might not seem like a huge difference, it can make a significant impact on your ability to store files and apps on the laptop.

## Design

While the overall design of the two models is very similar, there are a few differences worth noting. The second generation of the Asus Chromebook C201 has a slightly more refined look, with a more streamlined profile and a smaller bezel around the screen. Additionally, the second generation is slightly lighter than the first, weighing in at just 2.2 pounds compared to 2.4 pounds for the first generation.

## Battery Life

Finally, the two models have slightly different battery lives. The first generation of the Asus Chromebook C201 has a battery life of up to 13 hours, while the second generation has a battery life of up to 12 hours. While this might not seem like a huge difference, it's worth noting if you plan to use your laptop for extended periods of time without access to a power source.

In conclusion, if you own an Asus Chromebook C201, it's worth taking a few minutes to check which version you have. While the differences between the two models might not seem significant at first, they can make a big impact on your user experience. From a faster processor to more storage, the second generation is definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a new Chromebook.

 Hi Chase,
You can flip your Chromebook over and look for the model number under the barcode. For example, in this picture the model number is C201PA.

 What is your model number?  You need that in order to get the correct part.
If it is "C100PA", then ifixit has a display assembly for your computer:
