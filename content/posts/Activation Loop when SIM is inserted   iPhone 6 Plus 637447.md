# Is Your iPhone 6 Plus Trapped in an Activation Loop? Find Out How to Fix It Now!

The activation loop is a common issue that iPhone 6 Plus users have to deal with. This loop occurs when the phone gets stuck on the activation screen, displaying the message "Could not activate iPhone." It is frustrating to have your device unusable when you need it the most. Luckily, there is a solution to this problem. In this article, we will explain how to fix your iPhone 6 Plus activation loop and get it up and running again. 

## What Causes the Activation Loop? 

The activation loop can occur for several reasons. The most common causes include a problem with your Wi-Fi connection or your SIM card. It can also be due to a software glitch or a hardware problem. It could be a result of an iOS update that didn't install correctly or something else that you did that caused the issue. 

## How to Fix the Activation Loop on Your iPhone 6 Plus

Outlined below are some simple solutions to try and fix the activation loop issue on your iPhone 6 Plus.

### Solution 1: Check Your Wi-Fi Connection

The first and most straightforward solution is to check your Wi-Fi connection. Ensure that you're connected to a stable Wi-Fi network to activate your iPhone. An unstable or slow internet connection can cause the activation loop. If your Wi-Fi doesn't work, try another network then attempt to activate your iPhone again. 

### Solution 2: Remove and Reinsert Your SIM Card

Sometimes, the SIM card inserted on your iPhone may be the reason for the activation loop. Check to see that your SIM card is intact and in the right position. If all appears well, remove your SIM card, then reinsert it. After doing so, restart your phone and try activating it once more. 

### Solution 3: Try a Forced Restart

Another possible solution is to perform a forced restart on your iPhone 6 Plus. Press and hold the power button and the home button until the Apple logo appears on the screen. Release the two buttons afterward and wait for your device to reboot. This process clears the iPhone's memory, which could be what's causing the activation loop. 

### Solution 4: Restore Your iPhone in DFU Mode

If the above solutions don't work, you may need to restore your iPhone 6 Plus in DFU mode. DFU stands for Device Firmware Update, and it's a mode where your iPhone can still communicate with iTunes without the iOS bootloader running. To put your phone in DFU mode, follow the steps outlined below.

* Connect your iPhone to a computer that has iTunes installed. 

* Press and hold the power button and home button simultaneously for eight seconds. 

* Release the power button while continuing to hold the home button. 

* Keep holding the home button until iTunes detects your device in recovery mode.

* After your device enters DFU mode, you can then restore it using iTunes.

## Conclusion

The activation loop on your iPhone 6 Plus can be frustrating, but it's not an unsolvable issue. By following the solutions outlined above, you can get your device running again. Check your Wi-Fi connection, remove and reinsert your SIM card, perform a forced restart, or restore your iPhone in DFU mode. Remember to back up your iPhone data before restoring it in DFU mode. If none of these solutions work for you, contact Apple Support for further help.

## Chosen Solution
 good evening guys.
I got a problem to activate my iPhone 6+
(I’ve read previous thread, not helpful much)
I bought this (refurbished unit) last year.
it was on iOS 9.
I am able to activate it before without any issues.
insert the SIM, you’re good to go (no TurboSIM).
I also able to update to iOS 11.2.1 without any issues (OTA update)
but, things happen after I restore the iPhone using iTunes (clearing things up).
the iPhone can be activated without SIM.
but once SIM is inserted, I got stuck in activation loop.
I got stuck in the screen as attached below.

when I plug-in to iTunes (using the original cable),
I got Error 0×E8000015
(I’ve done the workup as stated in previous thread, no avail)
I try activating using iTunes, no avail.
the iPhone just flickering the screen (as attached above).
I have no idea what to be done next.
can someone help me with this?
I am planning to give this iPhone to my wife

 Did you make sure your iTunes is up to date? Also you can try using 3UTools to activate the phone.
Have you checked that the IMEI still displays in the blue info icon on the lock screen or in settings > general > about phone also modem firmware too?
