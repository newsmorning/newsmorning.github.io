If you are a proud owner of an iPhone 4S, you know how valuable it is to have a smartphone that works like a charm. However, from time to time, this little wonder device may encounter issues that leave it unresponsive, unyielding, and, in some cases, dead. The good news is that, with some simple steps, you can learn how to bring your iPhone 4S back to life with the help of iTunes.

In this article, we will discuss a few common issues that may cause your iPhone 4S to stop working and how to resolve them using iTunes. We will also discuss how to use iTunes to restore your iPhone, as well as how to protect your device from data loss during the restoration process.

So let's get started!

## Issue #1: Your iPhone 4S Won't Turn On

Have you tried turning on your iPhone 4S and it just won't respond? If this is the case, don't panic! Try these simple tips:

1. Check Your USB Cable: Ensure that your USB cable is working properly by plugging it into your computer and checking if your iPhone starts charging.

2. Try a Different USB Port: Sometimes, USB ports can be faulty. Switch to a different port and see if your iPhone starts charging.

3. Hard Reset Your iPhone: Hold down the Sleep/Wake button and Home button together for 10 seconds until the Apple logo appears. This should force restart your iPhone and may fix the issue.

## Issue #2: Your iPhone 4S is Stuck in Recovery Mode

If you have tried to update or restore your iPhone using iTunes, you may have encountered the "recovery mode" screen. If your iPhone 4S is stuck in recovery mode, try the following:

1. Exit Recovery Mode: Hold down the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons together until your iPhone reboots. This should take your device out of recovery mode.

2. Restore Your iPhone 4S: Connect your iPhone to your computer and select "Restore iPhone" in iTunes. This will erase all data on your device and install the latest iOS version.

3. Restore Your iPhone Using DFU Mode: If restoring your iPhone 4S via iTunes did not work, you may need to try DFU mode. This is a deeper restore that erases and reinstalls everything on your device, including the firmware. Check out the Apple website for detailed instructions on how to use DFU mode.

## Issue #3: Your iPhone 4S is Disabled

If you have entered the wrong passcode on your iPhone 4S too many times, your device may become disabled. In this case, you will need to restore your iPhone using iTunes to remove the passcode and unlock your device.

1. Connect Your iPhone to Your Computer: Connect your iPhone to your computer using your USB cable.

2. Put Your iPhone in Recovery Mode: Hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button together until the recovery screen appears.

3. Restore Your iPhone: Click on "Restore iPhone" in iTunes to restore your device to its original factory settings, including removing the passcode.

## Protecting Your Data During a Restore

Restoring your iPhone 4S using iTunes will erase all data on your device. If you have not backed up your data, it will be lost forever. Therefore, before restoring your device, make sure to create a backup of your iPhone using iTunes or iCloud. This will ensure that all your data, including contacts, messages, photos, and apps, are saved in a safe place.

In Conclusion

In this article, we have discussed how to bring your iPhone 4S back to life using iTunes. Whether your device won't turn on, is stuck in recovery mode, or has been disabled because of a forgotten passcode, we have provided you with the necessary steps to restore it to its former glory. Remember to always back up your data to prevent data loss during a restore. With these easy tips, you can enjoy the full benefits of your iPhone 4S for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi I bought this phone from a friend . The phone says "IPhone disabled connect to iTunes" so I looked up videos on how to do it & I turned my iPhone off , held the home button & plugged it in . It went to recovery mode . I hit restore on iTunes & it says it will take about 60 mins to complete , so I waited & waited when it was at about 45 mins remaining , my iPhone turned back on to the screen that says phone is disabled , & on iTunes it pops up must need passcode .... Blah blah blah . The restoring is still counting loading and counting down..
What should I do ? Leave it how it is until the restoring is complete or does the iPhone have to be in the recovery mode to restore it ? Idk I'm confused , I just want to get his phone working :/

 When it gets into recovery mode, there is a timer that will automatically reboot itself out of it which is shorter than downloading the iPhone firmware (iOS Operating System) on a 4.5 Megabyte per second connection or slower. Just simply boot the phone into recovery mode again once it's finished downloading and click restore.
