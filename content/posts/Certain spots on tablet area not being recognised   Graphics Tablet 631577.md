Is Your Graphics Tablet Failing You? Discover The Shocking Truth About Certain Unresponsive Spots!

As an artist, designer, or illustrator, your graphics tablet is your most prized possession. It is the device that allows you to turn your creative ideas into stunning digital art. However, if you've been experiencing certain unresponsive spots on your tablet, it can be frustrating and interfere with your workflow.

Before you start thinking about purchasing a new tablet, it's essential to understand why certain areas on your tablet might be unresponsive. The good news is that it's not always the tablet's fault.

One of the primary reasons for unresponsive spots is dirt or debris buildup around the tablet's edges. Over time, dirt particles or grime can accumulate around the tablet's edges, causing interference with the tablet's electromagnetic signal. This interference can cause some areas of your tablet to become unresponsive or lag. The solution is simple; give your tablet a thorough cleaning around its edges with a soft cloth.

Another reason for unresponsive spots may be due to a damaged pen tip. If the tip of the pen is damaged, it can affect the tablet's responsiveness, causing certain areas to become unresponsive. Always inspect the pen's tip to ensure it's in good condition. Replace the pen tip if needed, to avoid any further damage to the tablet surface.

Finally, your tablet's drivers may be outdated, which could lead to unresponsive spots. Drivers are software that allows your tablet to communicate with your computer. If they are outdated, your tablet may not work correctly, and unresponsive spots may arise. Ensure that your tablet's drivers are up to date.

In conclusion, while it can be frustrating to experience unresponsive spots on your graphics tablet, it's not always the tablet's fault. Dirt and grime buildup around the tablet's edges or a damaged pen tip can affect the tablet's responsiveness. Always check the pen tip, clean the tablet's edges, and ensure that the tablet's drivers are up to date.

These solutions can save you from purchasing a new tablet and keep your creativity flowing.

## Chosen Solution
 When i point my pen at certain spots on the tablet area the cursor on the screen just begins to flicker or makes a detour around that spot. This happened overnight so i dont know what might have happened.
Support wont answer my mail so i hope someone might have an answer

 Which tablet is this? Iâ€™ve had this issue before where the cursor would just jump every time the pen pressed down onto the tablet.
The way I get it fixed is either by restarting the tablet driver service, restart the computer or re-install / update tablet drivers.
