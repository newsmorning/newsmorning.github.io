As a person with poor eyesight, I rely heavily on my eyeglasses to help me navigate through my daily routine. However, it wasn’t until recently that I realized the immense danger that a loose hinge on your glasses can pose. In fact, it almost cost me my sight! In this article, I’ll share my harrowing experience and offer tips on how to avoid a similar disaster.

Several weeks ago, I noticed that the hinge on my glasses was starting to become loose. Being the procrastinator that I am, I decided to put off getting it fixed. After all, what was the harm in wearing slightly loose glasses?

One day, while at the gym, the unthinkable happened. As I was putting weights away, one of the dumbbells accidentally hit me in the face, directly where the loose hinge was. The impact was so powerful that it actually caused my glasses to fly off my face completely. I was lucky that the weights didn’t do more damage, but unfortunately, my eyeglasses were a different story.

Upon inspection, I noticed that the impact had caused the loose hinge to snap and the eyeglass lens to pop out, shattering upon impact. Thankfully, I escaped with only a few cuts and bruises, but the thought of what could have happened had the dumbbell hit me even slightly differently still sends shivers down my spine.

So, how can you avoid this potentially catastrophic situation? Here are a few tips:

1. Don’t procrastinate getting your glasses fixed. If you notice that a hinge is loose, take it to an optometrist or eyeglass repair shop right away. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

2. Invest in high-quality glasses with sturdy hinges. Sure, they may cost more upfront, but it’s worth it to ensure that your glasses are durable and secure.

3. Always wear protective eyewear when engaging in activities that could pose a risk to your eyes. This includes anything from sports to home improvement projects.

4. If your glasses do break, don’t try to fix them yourself. Take them to a professional who can repair them safely and effectively.

In conclusion, my frightening experience with loose hinges on my eyeglasses was a wakeup call. Don't wait until something drastic happens to take action. Be proactive in caring for your eyeglasses and, most importantly, your vision. By following these simple tips, you can avoid a potentially catastrophic disaster and continue to see the world clearly.

## Chosen Solution
 I got this new pair of aviators and the arms I think (part that goes over your ear) have zero resistance. So they flop around and open when I’m not wearing them or when they’re on my shirt. Some glasses have arms that lock or click into either closed or open, and some just have a lot of friction that holds them somewhat to their position but mine is just loose and frictionless. Not a big deal, but it’d be nice if it could be tighter. There’s a small phillips screw on the hinge of each arm but I tried tightening it and it won’t budge. Do they come all the way tightened? Thank you sunglasses experts.

 Hi Josh,
Are the aviators name brand or generic? This can make a huge difference when answering this question. Typically, name brand glasses come with screws that are already tightened, but can also be adjusted (provided you have the correct screwdriver) as wear and tear occurs. Some off-brand glasses come with fixed screws that can’t be adjusted or will strip if tightened or loosened. Let me know which kind you have and I might have a better solution for you.

 regular/simple hinges on glasses are a tiny brass ring on one side, and a double ring on the other. A screw goes through them. Take a look at it now. Let me see if i can draw it.

Your hinge may not look like this, if that is the case then this probably won't help you.
The hinge on the frame has a slot for the arm-hinge-ring to slide into. Sometimes the ring either side of this slot is 'too open'. It happens from the arm being pushed in a direction it's not meant to go, leveraging the hinge apart. It can create the scenario you are experiencing.
FIRST: check, see if this description matches. If it doesn't, that's okay, sorry I couldn't help further.
SECOND: sometimes attempting to gently over tighten the screw is enough to bring these close together. This is risky though, it's easy to damage and glasses aren't forgiving.
THREE: remove the screw, set it somewhere safe like deep into the carpet or a rug (joking) Take some fine needle nose pliers and VERY GENTLY squeeze together the brass hinge. You need to be very careful here as we are stressing the metal. We only want to close that gap by a tiny tiny tiny amount to remove the looseness.  Squeeze too hard and the hinge will collapse and then it's completely ruined.
Bending metal like this, a brute way, weakens metal. The atoms which are part of the bend harden, Hard metal tends to crack, tear, snap, break. What you're about to do is delicate, and you only get a few tries at this before it will break from the metal hardening. Be careful, but don't feel too bad if this happens.
FOUR: replace the arm hinge half into the slot. You should feel some resistance, just barely any is enough.
FIVE: put a teeny tiny amount of glue on the thread of the screw. It doesn't need to be special or expensive glue. paper glue, craft glue, child snot. The point of the glue is to help harden the screw thread into the glasses, preventing the screw from creeping out. Superglue is too much. If you're stuck for an idea lick your fingers, touch sugar, rub your fingers together with the screw.  That's plenty of glue. This step is optional.
6IX: put the screw back in, tighten it to the point where you are happy with the tension of the arm. Lick the sugar from the hinge.
