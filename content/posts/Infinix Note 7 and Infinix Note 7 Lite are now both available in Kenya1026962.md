With each phone release, I am more convinced that you don’t really need to spend $1,000 to have a decent smartphone experience. Infinix’s newest additions into the Kenyan market is a true testament of the same.
 
They say cheap smartphones have gotten really good and the Infinix Note 7 devices (Infinix Note 7 and Infinix Note 7 Lite) are no exception. They bring a really visually-appealing design while sticking to the key aspects that make the Infinix Note series very appealing.
 
First things first, the numbers. How are these two devices spec’d?
 
## Infinix Note 7 Specs
 
The Infinix Note 7 Lite skims off the top but not by too much. The Lite version still packs quite a punch, as detailed in the spec sheet below.
 
## Infinix Note 7 Lite Specs
 
Since inception, Infinix’s Note line has been known for packing a relatively big footprint with a large display and a huge battery. These two deliver in that front with massive 6.6-inch displays and 5,000mAh battery cells.
 
Where these two devices even shine better is the camera department. The Infinix Note 7 sports four (4) camera sensors in a circular layout at the back, akin to what we saw on the Nokia 7.2. The device’s sensors are configured as follow: 48MP + 2MP + 2MP + 2 MP.
 
The Note 7 Lite has a more conventional-looking linear layout of a set of 4 camera units as well, a 48MP + 2MP + 2MP + 2 MP combination.
 
The Infinix Note 7 comes in two colors: Forest Green and Bolivia Blue. The Infinix Note 7 Lite, on the other hand, comes in three color options, Black, Green, and Purple.
 
## Price and Availability
 
The Infinix Note 7 has a recommended retail price of KES 17,799 while the Infinix Note 7 Lite should go for KES 15,500. Both devices should be available in local retail stores immediately.
