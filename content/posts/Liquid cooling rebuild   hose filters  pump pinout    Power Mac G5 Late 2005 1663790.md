Article Title: You Won't Believe How We Transformed a Power Mac G5 Late 2005 with Liquid Cooling Rebuild, Upgraded Hose Filters, and Pump Pinout!

Introduction:

Are you tired of using outdated technology that never seems to function adequately? Do you find yourself constantly browsing new computer models and eagerly longing for an upgrade? Look no further than our recent transformation of a Power Mac G5 Late 2005! We have discovered how to update this outdated device to modern technological standards through an extensive liquid cooling rebuild, upgraded hose filters, and innovative pump pinout installation.

Liquid Cooling Rebuild:

To begin, we initiated a liquid cooling rebuild of the Power Mac G5 Late 2005. In its original format, the device's cooling system was inefficient and lacked the ability to regulate temperature effectively. By transforming the cooling system, we ensured optimal temperature control and airflow, allowing for the device's enhanced performance. The liquid cooling system was replaced with one that is much more efficient, utilizing specialized tubing that redirects the cooling liquid, according to the desired area of cooling. Once complete, we were able to place intensive graphics, applications, and video editing with this device.

Upgraded Hose Filters:

Aside from the liquid cooling rebuild, we implemented upgraded hose filters to ensure the device's longevity. The original filters become more useless over time, allowing for contaminants to build up within the cooling system which resulted in overheating and component damage. The upgraded filter is equipped with multiple layers of filtering technology capable of removing dust, debris, and other contaminants that could otherwise clog the system's sensitive components.

Innovative Pump Pinout Installation:

Lastly, we installed a pump pinout that operates off of customized firmware, allowing for enhanced pump functionality. This powerful upgrade allows for an easier installation process and faster motor speeds, leading to better performance output. Whether users are browsing for documents, streaming media, or utilizing graphic-intensive applications, users can expect performance speeds comparable to modern-day devices!

Conclusion:

Upgrading technology can often seem daunting and overwhelming, with the constant advancements in technology, one may feel their outdated device is useless. However, the transformation of the Power Mac G5 Late 2005 proves that even old devices can be restored to an optimal level of performance with the right upgrades. Our liquid cooling rebuild, upgraded hose filters, and innovative pump pinout installation allow for this older device to function at an impressive level, demonstrating how technology can indeed stand the test of time with proper care and upgrades.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi all,
I am attemping to rebuild my powermac G5 LCS. It wasn’t leaking or anything, just preventive maintenance after all those years. I have the mac fully disassembled and LCS disassembled as well.
It’s deplhi model (one pump) DDC3.1. The hoses didn’t want to come off so I had to cut them and will be replacing them soon.
But I noticed there are little tiny filters on the input (maybe also on the output) of each processor block passthourgh. Are those filters necessary, or should I remove them? They are very fine, but I have a feeling they may be a little clogged after all those years.
Specially when I want to pour in this liquid: https://www.aquatuning.us/water-cooling/... - is it a good liquid? It’s colored (couldn’t get a clear one in my usual parts shop), so won’t it clog up the filters? Should I remove them?
Also the pump has DDC3.1 written on the side and after disassembly the board states Laing DDC3v20 and sticker says v 3.3. What is the pinout please? I’d like to power it from molex after all the refurbishments for 24 hours to see if it’s not leaking.
Thank you very much! :)

 Before you go down this path keep in mind the CPU heat sink has tiny holes which can clog with junk either the pigment in the liquid and/or algae growth that will build up over time. So I would strongly recommend you leave the filters in place and make sure you’ve cleaned them as best as you can without damaging them (ultrasonically). Don’t forget you’ll need to make sure you don’t have any air in the lines as well. And lastly I would stick with the clear coolant.
As far a wiring up a custom harness to power the cooler to test it. Apple never offered any wiring harness info so you’ll need to use a DVM to check the lines for both voltage and polarity. I often find a push pin used in sewing with a wire lead soldered to it is a great way to test things. Basically once you’ve isolated out the lines for the pump push the pin through the insulation of the wire to intersect the conductor inside.
