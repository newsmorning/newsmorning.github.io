Does it take forever to open a program or browse the internet? If so, your computer might be filled with unnecessary files and programs, and it’s time for a clean slate. But how can you get your computer running like new again without spending a lot of money? Here are three simple tricks that will allow you to wipe and reinstall Windows 10 with ease.\nUse the Reset this PC feature. The Reset this PC feature is part of Windows 10 that allows you to refresh your computer to its original state. It’s fast, easy and won’t require any technical skills. You can keep your files, but all your installed apps and settings will be lost. To use Reset this PC:\nOpen Settings by pressing Windows + I. Go to Update \u0026 Security \u003e Recovery \u003e Get Started. Choose whether you want to keep your personal files or remove everything. Follow the on-screen instructions. Your computer will restart and go through a series of processes that will take some time. But once it’s finished, you’ll have a fresh start and your computer will be running like new again.\nCreate a bootable USB drive. If your computer is so slow or broken that you can’t use the Reset this PC feature, you can create a bootable USB drive with Windows 10 and reinstall it from scratch. This is also useful if you want to wipe your computer completely and start from scratch. Here’s how to create a bootable USB drive:\nDownload the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Microsoft’s website. Run the tool and select Create installation media for another PC. Choose the language, edition, and architecture of Windows 10 you want to install. Choose USB flash drive as the media type and select your USB drive. Wait for the tool to download and create the bootable USB drive. Once you have the bootable USB drive ready, plug it into your computer and restart it. Press the boot key (usually F12) to enter the boot options menu and choose the USB drive. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows 10 from scratch.\nUse third-party software. If you’re not comfortable using Windows 10 features or creating a bootable USB drive, there are third-party software options that can help you wipe and reinstall Windows 10. These options are usually not free, but they provide a more user-friendly interface and additional features. Some popular options are:\nCCleaner: a cleaning tool that removes junk files, frees up disk space and deletes private data. EaseUS Todo Backup: a backup and restore software that can backup your entire system, disks, files and folders to external drives or clouds. Revo Uninstaller: a tool that uninstalls programs, removes leftover files and registry entries. With these third-party software options, you can customize your cleaning and reinstalling process to suit your needs.\nConclusion\nWhether you use the Reset this PC feature, create a bootable USB drive or third-party software, wiping and reinstalling Windows 10 can help you get your computer running like new again. Don’t let your slow or broken computer bring you down – take action and use these simple tricks to give it a fresh start.\nWe’re all thankful that it’s no longer the days where it seemed like you had to re-install Windows every six months. There are still times, though, where we must go to the last resort. Sometimes, you just have to scrap it all and start all over again.\nWhen Should I Re-install Windows? There are several things you can do to fix minor and major Windows problems. The Check Disk (CHKDSK) utility is great for fixing issues with the file system due to bad sectors on hard drives. We can show you how to fix file system errors in Windows with CHKDSK.\nThe System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) command line tools can find and fix a host of Windows issues.\nSFC is great for finding and repairing system files in Windows, whereas DISM can do a more thorough check and repair Windows using resources from Microsoft’s Windows Update service. We have a whole article on how to use SFC and DISM. Try these things first.\nIf that doesn’t do it, and you’re certain that the issue isn’t a hardware issue, then it might be time to start again. WARNING: we’re talking about wiping away all your files and programs and starting again. Make sure to back up your files to an external drive or to a cloud storage service.\nThree Ways to Do a Clean Reinstall of Windows There are three ways you can do a clean reinstall of Windows. We’ll be focusing on Windows 10. If you’re using Windows 8.1 or earlier, the first two are for you.\nPerform a Reset from Windows Settings.Reinstall by rebooting with installation media like a DVD or bootable USB drive.Reinstall from inside of Windows with installation media. Reset this PC for a Clean Install This should be your first option when trying to completely wipe your computer and re-install Windows 10. It’s simple, doesn’t require a DVD or USB drive, and doesn’t even require you to enter your Windows license key.\nIn the Type here to search bar, start typing Settings. When the Settings utility is shown, click on that to start it.\nIn the Settings window, scroll down and click on Update \u0026 Security.\nIn the Update \u0026 Settings window, on the left-side, click on Recovery. Once it’s in the Recovery window, click on the Get Started button.\nTo wipe everything from your computer, click on the Remove everything option.\nIt may take a few minutes to get things ready. Then, it will tell you that the current setting is to Just remove your files. This is quicker but less secure. We’re going for a complete wipe, so this isn’t enough. Click on Change settings.\nIn this window, click on the Off button to get to the data erasure option. Click Confirm.\nAfter a few seconds, you’ll see the Ready to reset this PC window. If you’re certain you want to do this, click on Reset.\nIt will prepare to do the reset. This part can take several minutes. During our test, it took about 15 minutes. Then the computer restarts.\nWhen the computer restarts, you’ll see the Windows logo and Please wait. Then the screen may go black for a few minutes. Be patient.\nThe Windows logo will come back and under it will read Resetting this PC. It will start to count in percentage of completion. This can take several minutes to an hour or more depending on your PC. When it is complete, you can begin your Windows set up again.\nReinstall Windows from DVD or Bootable USB Drive You’ll need to have either the Windows DVD that came with your computer or you bought on its own, or a bootable USB drive with Windows on it. Many laptop and computer makers have utilities built into their Windows installs to help you create these recovery drives.\nIf you didn’t make one when you got your computer, now’s the time to do that. Using the manufacturer’s official Windows installation is the best way to go, as it will have all the hardware drivers specific to the make and model of your computer.\nIf that’s not an option, you can download an official ISO of Windows 10 using the Windows Media Creation Tool or just your web browser. We can also show you where to get Windows 8.1 or 7 ISOs. You’ll need to find your Windows Product Key.\nThe Windows Media Creation tool will guide you through the creation of a bootable USB drive or DVD. It’s surprisingly simple, but it can take a while.\nNext, you’ll need to boot your computer from the DVD or USB drive. You may need to access your computer’s BIOS and change the boot order. It’s likely set to boot from your hard drive first. Reboot your PC and follow the steps below.\nWhen your computer starts, you’ll be presented with the Windows installation wizard, which will walk you through the process.\nTo do this in a way that wipes the drive, go until you get to the point where you’ll be asked, Which type of installation do you want? At this point choose Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).\nYou may be asked where you would like to install Windows. Typically, it will be the Primary drive. Select that and click Next.\nThe installation will continue. First, you’ll see a screen like the one below for several minutes. Then your computer will restart, and you’ll see a black screen with a blue Windows icon. It will go through several stages not requiring any input from you.\nEventually, you’ll see the blue install screen with a rotating circle and the words Just a moment… You’re almost there. This will take several minutes and go through some more text.\nNow, you’ll be at the Windows set up stage. Continue through this to get Windows set up and you’re ready to go.\nReinstall Windows from Your Install Media, from Inside of Windows This method is a last resort. The Reset this PC method is easier and quicker. That might not be an option for you, so let’s go over how-to re-install Windows from inside of your current Windows installation. The one upside to this method is that you should not have to enter your Windows product key for it to work.\nInsert your Windows installation media. Navigate to it in File Explorer and open it. Then look for your Windows installation media. Open it and look for the setup application and double-click on it.\nThe User Account Control (UAC) window will open asking if you want to all this app to make changes to this device. Click Yes.\nA small window will open showing the Windows logo and will proceed to say that it is preparing. It will count percentage of readiness.\nNext, the Windows 10 Setup window will open. It reads Install Windows 10 and that it will go online to get updates. If you wanted, you could click on Change how Windows Setup downloads updates. For our purposes, click on the Next button.\nIt may quickly go through a few screens, like Getting updates, Restarting Windows 10 Setup, Checking your PC, We’re getting a few things ready, and then stop on the Applicable notices and license terms screen. Feel free to read it and click on Accept.\nIt may quickly go through a few more screens such as Choose what to keep, Making sure you’re ready to install, and then it will stay on Getting updates for several minutes counting the percentage done. This can take a while.\nIt will then start Making sure your PC has enough space, and then arrive at the Ready to install screen. It may say that it will Keep personal files and apps. Just click on Change what to keep under that.\nThere will be three choices: Keep personal files and apps, Keep personal files only, and Nothing. If you want a clean wipe, click on Nothing then click Next.\nIt will then quickly go through some of the screens like before, and then you’ll see the big blue Installing Windows 10 screen. It warns that your PC will restart several times and that it will take a while. After some time, your computer will restart.\nYou’ll see your login screen and the message Getting Windows ready. Don’t turn off your computer. That will go on for several minutes. Your screen may go black. Be patient.\nEventually, you’ll get to a full blue screen reading Installing Windows 0% Don’t turn off your PC. This will take a while. Your PC will restart several times. Yes, it does take a while. Our test run took well over an hour.\nFinally, the computer will restart, and you should be at your login window again. Log in and proceed to set up Windows.\nWelcome to Your Fresh Windows Install Those are the three ways that you can install Windows in a way that completely wipes out everything on your computer. This is a new start. Just remember, if you wanted to access any of your old files you better have them backed up to a cloud service or on an external hard drive.

At this point choose Custom: Install Windows only (advanced).</p><p>You may be asked where you would like to install Windows. Typically, it will be the Primary drive. Select that and click Next.</p><p>The installation will continue. First, you’ll see a screen like the one below for several minutes. Then your computer will restart, and you’ll see a black screen with a blue Windows icon. It will go through several stages not requiring any input from you.</p><p>Eventually, you’ll see the blue install screen with a rotating circle and the words Just a moment… You’re almost there. This will take several minutes and go through some more text.</p><p>Now, you’ll be at the Windows set up stage.

The Reset this PC
method is easier and quicker. That might not be an option for you, so let’s go
over how-to re-install Windows from inside of your current Windows
installation. The one upside to this method is that you should not have to
enter your Windows product key for it to work.</p><p>Insert your Windows installation media. Navigate to it in File Explorer and open it. Then look for your Windows installation media. Open it and look for the setup application and double-click on it.</p><p>The User Account Control (UAC) window will open asking if you want to all this app to make changes to this device. Click Yes.</p><p>A small window will open showing the Windows logo and will proceed to say that it is preparing. It will count percentage of readiness.</p><p>Next, the Windows 10 Setup window will open. It reads Install Windows 10 and that it will go online to get updates. If you wanted, you could click on Change how Windows Setup downloads updates. For our purposes, click on the Next button.</p><p>It may quickly go through a few screens, like Getting updates, Restarting Windows 10 Setup, Checking your PC, We’re getting a few things ready, and then stop on the Applicable notices and license terms screen. Feel free to read it and click on Accept.</p><p>It may quickly go through a few more screens such as Choose what to keep, Making sure you’re ready to install, and then it will stay on Getting updates for several minutes counting the percentage done. This can take a while.</p><p>It will then start Making sure your PC has enough space, and then arrive at the Ready to install screen. It may say that it will Keep personal files and apps. Just click on Change what to keep under that.</p><p>There will be three choices: Keep personal files and apps, Keep personal files only, and Nothing. If you want a clean wipe, click on Nothing then click Next.</p><p>It will then quickly go through some of the screens like before, and then you’ll see the big blue Installing Windows 10 screen. It warns that your PC will restart several times and that it will take a while. After some time, your computer will restart.</p><p>You’ll see your login screen and the message Getting Windows ready. Don’t turn off your computer. That will go on for several minutes. Your screen may go black. Be patient.</p><p>Eventually, you’ll get to a full blue screen reading Installing Windows 0% Don’t turn off your PC. This will take a while. Your PC will restart several times. Yes, it does take a while. Our test run took well over an hour.</p><p>Finally, the computer will restart, and you should be at your login window again. Log in and proceed to set up Windows.</p><h2 id=welcome-to-your-fresh-windows-install>Welcome to Your Fresh Windows Install<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#welcome-to-your-fresh-windows-install>#</a></h2><p>Those are the three ways that you can install Windows in a way that completely wipes out everything on your computer.
