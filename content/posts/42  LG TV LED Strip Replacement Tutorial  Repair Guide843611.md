Introduction:

Nothing is more annoying than having a broken LG TV, especially if it is your favorite entertainment source. And while you may feel helpless, intimidated or even stressed about the repair process, you do not have to worry anymore.

We ensure that with this tutorial, you will have both a functional and bright TV in no time.

Step 1: Check Your TV for LED Strip Damage

The first step to fixing your LG TV is to identify the root of the problem. Therefore, begin by examining the TV to determine whether the LED strip is the issue. Usually, a broken or damaged LED strip results in one side of the screen appearing dimmer than the other or a dark line appearing across the screen. If you notice any of these signs, then chances are your LG TV has an LED strip problem.

Step 2: Order a Replacement LED Strip

With your LG TV problem identified, the next step is to purchase a replacement LED strip. You can get this from either an online store or a physical store near you. However, ensure that you buy the right LED strip for your LG TV model.

Step 3: Gather the Tools and Prepare Your Workstation

Before you start repairing the LG TV, you need to have the right tools at hand. Therefore, gather a screwdriver, pliers, and a soft cloth for cleaning the display. Also, prepare your workstation by laying a soft cloth on the table to protect your TV from scratches and other damages.

Step 4: Remove the TV Back Cover

With your workstation prepared, you can now start disassembling the TV. Begin by removing the back cover using a screwdriver. However, take care not to damage any wires or other components.

Step 5: Remove the Damaged LED Strip

Next, locate the damaged LED strip and remove it by pulling the strips off the frame using pliers. It would help to take a photo of the TV's interior to ensure you install the new LED strip correctly.

Step 6: Install the New LED Strip

Once you remove the damaged LED strip, install the new strip carefully. Place the new LED strip on the same side that the damaged one came from, using the adhesive tape to hold it in place. Reconnect the connectors and replace the screws to hold everything in place.

Step 7: Check and Close the TV

With the new LED strip in place, reconnect the TV connectors and turn on the TV to check if everything is working correctly. Suppose the display is functioning correctly; turn off the TV and replace the back cover by reinserting the screws.

Conclusion:

With this 42 LED strip replacement tutorial, fixing your LG TV will be quick, easy and stress-free. You do not have to wait for a technician or pay hefty repair fees, as you can do this on your own. Follow these easy steps, and you will enjoy clear, bright, and high-quality images on your LG TV once more. So the next time your LG TV has LED strip problems, remember this tutorial and give it a try.

## Introduction
 
However, when it comes to replacing or reinstalling LED strips or arrays, people usually approach a TV repair technician. Yet, you can do it by yourself at your home.
 
This repair guide will work with the following models:
 
42LY340C-UA BUSWLJR 42LB5600-UZ BUSWLOR 42LF5600-UB BUSYLOR 42LF5600-UB BUSDLJM 42LF5600-UB AUSYLOR 42LF5600-UB BUSYLJR 42LF5800-UA BUSYLOR 42LX530S-UA BCCYLOR 42LX330C-UA BUSYLOR
 
A Backlight LED Array is a long circuit board containing surface-mount device light-emitting diodes (SMD LEDs) that radiate light into a room to provide illumination. The strips are sometimes referred to as LED tape or ribbon lights, and they typically include an adhesive backing that makes them simple to install.
 
LED light strip options that are among the finest available may be utilized for various interior design projects, including recessed lighting, television backlighting, and kitchen countertop illumination with under cabinet lighting.
 
In this tutorial, we are using these backlight LED Arrays to replace the LED strips of the LG 42inch LED. These LED strips are chosen for their high level of quality, usefulness, and visually appealing design. Other factors considered are the adhesive strength, app functioning, brightness, and simplicity of installation, and how well the light strips functioned in general terms.
 
It costs between $100 and $125 to replace one LED backlighting strip, including all necessary components and labor. Repairing older TVs is more expensive. Parts for these televisions may be difficult to find. Additionally, components for televisions with a screen size of 42" or larger are costlier.
 
How do I change the LED strip on my LG TV? In this tutorial, we'll teach you how to replace the LG 42inch LED TV strips.Â  This tutorial will work with a wide range of LG 42inch LED TV models, even though these models may vary somewhat from one another. These LG 42lb5600 Screen Replacement Steps that we are demonstrating should apply to all of the models.
