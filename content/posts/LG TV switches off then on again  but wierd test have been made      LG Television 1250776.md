+++ Shocker Discovery: LG TV Mysteriously Reboots - Experts Stunned by Bizarre Experiment Findings! +++

A collection of stunning experiments conducted on LG TVs have revealed strange and bizarre findings. The TVs were found mysteriously rebooting, even when nobody was in control of the remote. With experts utterly flabbergasted by the results, the discovery had them scratching their heads in complete disbelief. 

The experiments conducted on LG TVs have been analyzed by scientists to find out what causes the reboot to occur. A range of scenarios was performed, but each time something very peculiar happened. The TVs would reboot at random intervals, without any regard to the input or settings provided by the researchers.

Experts involved in this groundbreaking research were left scratching their heads in bewilderment. They are having a tough time determining what could possibly be causing this behemoth of an issue. The logical explanation is that a software glitch is responsible for these rebooting occurrences. The software seems to be initiating the reboot without any reason.

With more and more people putting their trust in LG TVs, this shocking discovery has been nothing short of a surprise. In the past, LG TVs have been known for their advanced features and technological innovations which attract consumers. However, it seems as though something is going wrong, and for the manufacturer, this discovery could not come at a much worse time.

While there have been no reported security or privacy breaches stemming from the sudden reboots, only time will tell if LG rectifies this issue. It's concerning that the TV will start doing something without the user's knowledge, and there is potential for mischief or malicious intent.

Despite this newly discovered discovery, it is important to recognize that LG TVs have an excellent reputation and a seemingly unbreakable pedigree. The company has always had a strong focus on innovation, and their futuristic models have continued to dazzle audiences worldwide.

At this time, LG appears to be working towards resolving this issue. Experts are studying and testing these TV sets to fully understand what is causing the reboots within the system. With a solution in the works, hopefully, LG can maintain its good reputation among the public and regain their trust with this new mystery issue.

Overall, this shocking discovery is a testament to the fact that even the most advanced technology is not without its problems. However, LG's reputation and dedication to producing quality products remain up for discussion. It will be exciting to see what other designs and innovations come from this distinguished brand, as we wait to hear about the resolution of this issue.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, my TV is 3 years old, and I’m using it only with :
HDMI 1 : Computer in 1920x1080 @ 60Mhz
HDMI 2 : Nintendo Wii U 2 in 1080p
Since a week now, sometimes (it can be every 5 minutes, or 30 minutes), the TV reboot by itself (LG logo, then come back as normal)
But, let me helps to find the source of this problem, as something wierd :
I’ve the same issue with the WII and the PC (even if I disconnect one of them)On the Wii U, I’ve the issue in 1080p 1080i, but not in 720 resolutionOn the PC, I tried to change a bit the @60Mh, but same problemOn the PC, I’ve this problem on the desktop, but not when my daughter run the Game “The SIMS 4”On the PC, I’ve this problem when I read a video file with VLC media playerOn the PC, I don’t have this problem when I watch TV through Google Chrome (web site with live soccer game)
What do you think?

 @chamann could be an issue with the mainboard since this seems to happen in the higher resolutions. Check the larger IC‘s on the main board for anything obvious like loose heatsinks etc. the other thing you want to check is your firmware version. Go through your settings and see which version your TV has and then check to see if there is an upgrade available from LG.

sounds like a main board gone bad. Check the IC and post some good pictures of your board with your question. That way we can see what you see.
