# You won't believe what's keeping your Microsoft Forms from opening - Discover the top 5 solutions now!

If you're using Microsoft Forms to create and manage online surveys or quizzes, there may come a time when the platform won't open. It's frustrating, but not all hope is lost. In this article, we'll explore the top five solutions to help you get back into Microsoft Forms.

## The Problem

You click on the Microsoft Forms icon or link, or type its web address into the URL bar, and nothing happens. You try again with different web browsers, computers, or devices, but to no avail. You wonder what's wrong and how you can fix it.

## The Solutions

Don't worry. Here are five things you can try to troubleshoot the issue and regain access to Microsoft Forms.

### 1. Check Your Internet Connection

The first and simplest solution is to check whether you have a stable and fast internet connection. Microsoft Forms is an online service, which means it requires a reliable and speedy connection to function properly. Slow or intermittent connections can cause timeouts, errors, or delays that prevent the page from loading or rendering correctly.

You can test your internet speed by using tools like Speedtest by Ookla (https://www.speedtest.net/) or Google's speed test (https://www.google.com/search?q=speed+test) and compare the results to your internet plan. If your speed is below par, you may need to upgrade your plan, switch ISPs, or troubleshoot your network hardware, such as your router, modem, or cables.

### 2. Clear Your Browser Cache and Cookies

The second solution is to clear your browser cache and cookies, which are temporary files that your browser saves to speed up your browsing experience and remember your preferences and credentials. However, over time, these files can accumulate and cause conflicts, corruption, or outdated data that interfere with the proper functioning of web apps like Microsoft Forms.

To clear your cache and cookies, you can follow the instructions for your specific browser, such as Chrome (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050), Firefox (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), Edge (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/view-and-delete-browser-history-in-microsoft-edge-00cf7943-a9e1-975a-a33d-ac10ce454ca4), or Safari (https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/clear-your-browsing-history-sfri47acf5d6/mac). Once you've cleared your cache and cookies, try to reopen Microsoft Forms and see if it works.

### 3. Disable Your AdBlocker or Antivirus

The third solution is to disable or whitelist your ad blocker or antivirus software, which may block or scan certain scripts, pop-ups, or elements that Microsoft Forms needs to function. Ad blockers are handy to remove annoying ads and privacy trackers, but they can also interfere with legitimate content, like web forms or scripts. Antivirus software is useful to protect your computer from malware and threats, but it can also flag safe sites or files as potentially harmful, like Microsoft Forms.

To disable your ad blocker or antivirus, you need to access the settings or extensions menu of your browser or security software and add an exception or turn off the corresponding toggle. For example, if you're using AdBlock Plus (https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000061060-disabling-adblock-plus-temporarily), Avast (https://support.avast.com/en-eu/article/Disable-AV-forms), or Windows Defender (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-off-windows-defender-20916b52-eda3-7d79-3412-c62537087758), you can follow the links to learn how to disable them temporarily or permanently. Once you've disabled your ad blocker or antivirus, try to reopen Microsoft Forms and see if it works.

### 4. Disable Your VPN or Proxy

The fourth solution is to disable or change your virtual private network (VPN) or proxy settings, which may redirect, encrypt, or mask your internet traffic and change your IP address or geolocation. VPNs and proxies are handy to enhance your online security and privacy, bypass regional or content restrictions, or avoid data throttling, but they can also interfere with the normal operation of web apps like Microsoft Forms.

To disable or change your VPN or proxy, you need to access the settings or menu of your VPN or proxy client or browser extension and disconnect or choose a different server or location. For example, if you're using NordVPN (https://support.nordvpn.com/Having-connection-issues/) or ExpressVPN (https://www.expressvpn.com/support/troubleshooting/unblock-websites-with-location-settings), you can follow the links to learn how to disable them temporarily or permanently or choose a different location. Once you've disabled your VPN or proxy, try to reopen Microsoft Forms and see if it works.

### 5. Contact Microsoft Support

The fifth and final solution is to contact Microsoft support and report the issue. If none of the above solutions work, it may indicate a deeper or more technical problem that requires the assistance of Microsoft's experts. You can reach out to Microsoft support via the following channels:

- Microsoft Forms support forum (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-forms/bd-p/MicrosoftForms)
- Microsoft Forms support website (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/forms)
- Microsoft support website (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/)

Be sure to provide them with as much information as possible, such as your operating system, browser version, error messages or codes, and steps you've taken to troubleshoot the problem.

## Conclusion

Microsoft Forms is a powerful and versatile tool to create and manage online surveys and quizzes, but it may encounter occasional issues that prevent it from opening. If you're facing this problem, don't panic. Instead, try the five solutions we've discussed in this article, such as checking your internet connection, clearing your browser cache and cookies, disabling your ad blocker or antivirus, disabling your VPN or proxy, or contacting Microsoft support. With some patience, persistence, and expertise, you'll be back to creating awesome forms in no time.
