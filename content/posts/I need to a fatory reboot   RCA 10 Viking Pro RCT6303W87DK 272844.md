What is a Factory Reboot?

A factory reboot, also known as a factory reset or hard reset, is a process that erases all data and settings on your device and puts it back to its original state. This means that all apps, files, and personal data will be deleted, including photos, music, and documents.

A factory reboot is also necessary when you plan to sell or give away your device, as it ensures that all personal data is securely erased and cannot be retrieved by others.

- You're planning to sell or give away your RCA 10 Viking Pro and want to ensure that all data is erased.

In all these situations, a factory reboot can help resolve the issue and restore your device to its original performance.

Before proceeding with a factory reset, it's essential to back up your data. You can transfer your files to an external drive or use a cloud backup service to store them securely.

1. Go to the Settings app on your tablet.

 As with most Android tablets/2-in-1s, to factory reset the system you follow the following steps:
Turn the device off, if you haven't already. Turn it back on while pressing and holding Volume up (+) and the Power button.
It should soon come up with a black screen with some menu options. This is the ARM BIOS, in a nutshell. You are free to release the buttons now, if you haven't.
Use the Volume up (+) and Volume down (-) buttons to navigate the menu. Find Factory Reset, or something similar. Tap the power button when selected; do not hold it down as it will turn the device back off.
Select "yes" and wait. It will do its thing and completely reset to factory. Note that it will not reset back to a previous version if it was recently upgraded to a newer Android version. It will clear all user data, but retain system data.
Hope this helps.
