## Chosen Solution
 I am trying to connect a 2006 nintendo wii to my 2017 MacBook Pro. The set up I am trying to use includes: a 3rd party usb-c to hdmi adapter connected to an cdmi cord that is plugged into an cdmi to wii adapter that is plugged into the wii. It sounds like I got a lot going on, but according to the research I've done each of these components are compatible individually. However, when I plug it into my laptop nothing happens. I can't figure out why my computer isn't reacting to my efforts to use its display for this harebrained scheme.

I have tried using different cdmi cords to see if that was the problem, but it didn't change anything. I tried having my computer 'search for more displays' in the settings and nothing happened. I only have access to one of each adapter but the wii to cdmi has a light that comes on when I plug it in, suggesting that its at least connected. Are these adapters themselves just not compatible and should I just finally give up on this project, or do you have any ideas to help me figure this out?

 Your Macbook  does not have a display Input Board. You need a dedicated capture card for that.
