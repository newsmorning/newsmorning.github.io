A broken home button on an iPhone can be a serious inconvenience, leading to frustration and difficulty in accessing the device. But what if I told you there's a way to bypass the broken home button and still enjoy using your phone? In this article, we will delve into the story of an iPhone 5S with a Home Button outage but Touch ID still working.

### The Story Begins

Jack was an iPhone 5S user who never felt the need to upgrade his phone for the newer models. He loved his iPhone 5S that he had for as long as he could remember, and he believed it was still the perfect phone for him. One day, he noticed that his home button wasn't working correctly. It wasn't responding to touch, and he couldn't use it to navigate his phone.

### Attempted Fixes

In an attempt to fix the home button, Jack tried a few troubleshooting tips he found on the internet, such as restarting the phone and cleaning the button. However, none of these methods worked, and he was still stuck with a nonfunctional home button. He considered taking it to a phone repair shop, but the expense discouraged him.

### A Surprising Discovery

After discovering his home button was out of order, Jack noticed something else. His phone's Touch ID was still active, and he could still use it to unlock his iPhone! This got him curious and left him wondering if there was a way he could bypass his broken home button and continue using his phone.

### AssistiveTouch - A Temporary Solution

After a quick search on the internet, Jack discovered the AssistiveTouch feature on his iPhone. This feature pops up a virtual button on the screen that can be customized and used as a home button. This changes the way you use the iPhone slightly as you have to use the virtual home button each time you want to return to the home screen, but users find it an excellent alternative as a temporary solution for a broken home button. 

### Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the story of the iPhone 5S with a Home Button outage but Touch ID still working is a lesson to all smartphone users: don't give up hope if your phone starts having issues. Even if it appears that it's beyond repair, there could be alternative solutions or workarounds to help you continue using your phone. And remember, before attempting any solution, make sure you research the issue or talk to a professional. Technology is advancing rapidly, and every day new innovations are being discovered, which can help us improve our devices' functionality. Always keep an open mind and be willing to try new approaches!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I've replaced my iPhone 5s battery. After the replacement, my home button is not working, but my TouchID is working :( I've checked the cables, but nothing seems to be damaged.
Any solutions?
Edit: I've also noticed that the sound does not work well when I use headphones.

 1)i guess narrow damage should have in reborn flex cable or connectors, check again
2) you can dis assemble key and there is key dome switch which is taking pulses and it is covers by plastic cover. check inside of dome switch whether interfaces corroded or any internal damages to the flex cable
3) disable all securities in the phone and replaced the Home key
