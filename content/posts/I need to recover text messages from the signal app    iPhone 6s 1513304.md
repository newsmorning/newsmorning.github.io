Are you desperate to recover your deleted Signal app messages on your iPhone 6S? You are not alone! Losing important messages or accidental deletion can be a nightmare for many. However, the good news is that it is possible to recover deleted Signal app messages on the iPhone 6S. 

In this article, we will guide you through the process of recovering your deleted Signal app messages on your iPhone 6S using three different methods.

Method 1: Restore from iCloud or iTunes Backup

If you have previously backed up your iPhone 6S to iCloud or iTunes, there is a high chance that your deleted Signal app messages are recoverable. To recover your deleted Signal app messages using this method, follow the steps below:

1. Connect your iPhone 6S to your computer and open iTunes.
2. Choose “Restore Backup” and select the most recent backup that contains your Signal app messages.
3. Once the restore process is complete, open the Signal app and check if your deleted messages are recovered.

Note: If you use iCloud backup, you can restore your deleted Signal app messages directly from iCloud. 

Method 2: Use a Third-Party Data Recovery Tool

Another way to recover your deleted Signal app messages on your iPhone 6S is by using a third-party data recovery tool. Many data recovery tools are available in the market, such as EaseUS MobiSaver, Disk Drill, and FoneLab.

If the above two methods fail to recover your deleted Signal app messages, you can seek help from Signal support. You can contact the Signal support team via email or submit a ticket on their website. Provide them with your Signal account details and the timeline of the deleted messages. 

Signal may be able to recover your deleted messages from their server if they are not too old. However, there is no guarantee that Signal support can recover all your deleted messages.
