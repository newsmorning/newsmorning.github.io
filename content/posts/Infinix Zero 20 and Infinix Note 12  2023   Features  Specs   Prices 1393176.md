## Infinix Zero 20: Features And Specs
 
As you would expect, the Infinix Zero series will typically be superior to the Note series. And the Infinix Zero 20 is no exception. In terms of screen real estate, expect a 6.7-Inch AMOLED display with a dazzling 90 Hz of refresh rate. The SoC is the Helio G99 from MediaTek driving a nifty 1080p FHD+ display resolution. To stand out from the already crowded tier, the Infinix Zero 20 is the only 2022 phone to feature Optical Image Stabilisation(OIS) on a 60MP selfie camera.
 
At the back of the Infinix Zero 20, you will find a 108MP main camera, a 13MP wide-angle sensor, and a 2MP auxiliary sensor. Battery capacity and Fast Charging are the other important smartphone features that this new device keeps up with the competition. The Zero 20 comes with a 4500mAh battery coupled with 45W fast charging.  This device comes with Android 12 out of the box but you will have to live with the  Infinix XOS skin. 
 
The colors available at the moment are Gold and Gray, that’s not a lot to choose from. The same applies to the RAM and Storage, there’s just the 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage configuration. For an Helio G99, some may find the Infinix Zero 20 overpriced at €460. There is no official retail price in Kenya but you can expect it to range between ksh45,000 and Ksh52,000 based on prices in other countries.

## Infinix Note 12 (2023): Specs And Features
 
As highlighted earlier, the Infinix Zero 20 is the more interesting and superior of the 2 devices we are discussing today. However, that does not condemn the Infinix Note 12 (2023) to be a terrible device, quite far from the truth. As you can already see, Infinix is now re-launching devices with a different “year-label”. Unlike the Infinix Zero 20, the Infinix Note 12 (2023) is not a new device per se. At it its simplest, the Infinix Note 12 (2023) is very similar to the Infinix Note 12 Pro with a few upgrades. 
 
First, they ditched the 108MP main shooter for a 50MP sensor. Secondly, the new device packs a single speaker as compared to the incumbent’s dual speaker setup. All other departments appear to remain unchanged. This means the SoC is an Helio G99 from MediaTek. At the back you will also find a 2MP auxiliary snapper then the front has a 16MP selfie shooter. The screen is still a 6.7″ AMOLED display. The battery is slightly larger than the Zero 20 at 5,000mAh. 
 
However, the charging capabilities have been turned down to 33W Fast Charging. This device also comes with Android 12 out of the box with the  Infinix XOS skin attached to it. Available colors for this device are Grey, White, and Blue with a single 8GB RAM and 128GB storage setup. This Infinix Note 12 (2023) is currently retailing at Ksh 28,000 in Kenya.
