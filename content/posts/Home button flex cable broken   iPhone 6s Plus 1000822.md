Title: The Tale of My iPhone 6S Plus Home Button

Introduction:

I had invested my hard-earned money into purchasing the iPhone 6S Plus, and I was thrilled with its performance. However, a bizarre incident occurred that left me flabbergasted. My iPhone 6S Plus's home button suddenly stopped working! Read on to discover the unusual story that resulted in my phone's faulty home button.

Body:

It all began on a lovely weekend with my family, and my 6S Plus was in my pocket. It was a beautiful day with a lot of fun activities. We went swimming, and I also played soccer with my children. Afterward, we decided to grab some ice cream from a nearby parlor.

When we got back to the car after enjoying our delicious ice cream, I noticed that the iPhone 6S Plus's home button wasn't responding. I tried all the troubleshooting tips I could find on the internet, but to no avail. I even took it to the Apple store, but they were unable to identify the problem.

Then, as if by magic, my youngest child confessed to contributing to the home button issue. He had shoved a small plastic toy into my pocket earlier that day, and it had accidentally found its way into the home button's crevices. The plastic toy had lodged itself into the crevice, damaging the button's functionality.

In a way, I couldn't believe the reason for the home button's malfunction. A plastic toy? It seemed almost impossible that such a small object could have such a significant impact on my phone's functionality. Nevertheless, it had happened, and I was left with a phone that needed a home button repair or replacement.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, I eventually got my home button repaired, but the incident reminded me of how vulnerable our electronic devices are. Even the smallest of objects can cause significant issues that ultimately require professional repair. Therefore, we must always be careful about what we carry in our pockets or around our electronic devices. It's essential to take proper care of our phones to avoid any major issues like this one. Always remember that an act of mischief by a child or an accidental mishap can lead to bizarre incidents with our valuable electronics.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi guys I have an iPhone 6s Plus lcd screen which I replaced and during the replacement I somehow damaged the components on the long flex cable attached with the lcd so now when I connect the home button to the connector the button doesnâ€™t work but the home button is absolutely fine with other lcds so I was wondering would I be able to buy just a long flex cable attached with lcd or do I have to buy a new lcd ?

 With that particular model, it is very common to damage the little cable built into the LCD, you will need to replace the entire LCD in order to fix the cable issue as the cable is built onto the backlight of the LCD and is extremely hard to replace individually.
