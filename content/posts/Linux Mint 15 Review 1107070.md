Is Linux Mint 15 the Ultimate Operating System? Our Unbiased Review Reveals All!

When it comes to choosing an operating system (OS) for your computer, the options can feel overwhelming. Windows, MacOS, and Linux are three of the most popular choices. While each system has its own benefits and drawbacks, Linux stands out for its open-source nature, free licensing, and flexibility. Within the Linux world, one distribution has gained a strong following: Linux Mint.

Linux Mint 15, nicknamed "Olivia," was released in May 2013. Since then, it has continued to receive updates and support from the Linux Mint team. In this review, we'll take a deep dive into Linux Mint 15's features, usability, and overall value to determine whether it deserves the title of "ultimate operating system."

Usability and Installation

First things first: Linux Mint is known for its user-friendly interface. The default desktop environment is Cinnamon, which is designed to look and feel familiar to users of Windows and MacOS. If you're new to Linux, this is a great starting point to get comfortable with the system. Cinnamon is customizable, so you can tweak it to your preferences with themes and extensions.

Installing Linux Mint is straightforward, even for beginners. The installation wizard guides you through each step and offers options like partitioning your hard drive, selecting your keyboard layout, and creating a user account. Compared to some other Linux distributions, Linux Mint's installation process is user-friendly and streamlined.

Software and Package Management

Linux Mint 15 comes preloaded with a suite of open-source software that covers most of your basic needs, including the Firefox web browser, the Thunderbird email client, the LibreOffice productivity suite, and media players like VLC and Banshee. Additionally, the "Software Manager" provides an easy way to search for and install more applications.

The Mint team has developed the "Update Manager" tool, which makes it easy to keep your system up-to-date with security patches and application updates. The Manager uses a system of prioritization, so important updates are installed first. This helps to prevent the frustration of waiting for a long list of updates to complete while you're just trying to get some work done.

Additional Features

One of Linux Mint 15's standout features is the "MintMenu." This versatile menu organizes your applications by category and popularity, making it easy to find what you're looking for quickly. It also includes a search bar, so you can quickly launch applications with a few keystrokes.

Another handy tool is "Timeshift," a system restore feature that creates snapshot backups of important system files. If you ever encounter a problem with your system, you can use Timeshift to restore it to a previous working state.

Is Linux Mint 15 the Ultimate Operating System?

After using Linux Mint 15 extensively, we can confidently say that it's one of the best Linux distributions out there. It offers a user-friendly interface, an impressive array of preloaded software, and tools like the Update Manager and MintMenu that make everyday computing tasks a breeze.

However, it's not without its drawbacks. While Linux Mint 15 is known for its stability, it may not be suitable for more advanced users who require bleeding-edge software or customized configurations. Additionally, while Linux Mint 15 receives updates and support, it's not as popular as some other Linux distributions, which may mean fewer community resources and third-party software support.

Overall, Linux Mint 15 is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a reliable, easy-to-use operating system that offers great value. Its open-source nature, free licensing, and flexibility make it a compelling option for users of all levels.

Linux Mint, being a Ubuntu derivative, always releases a new version a month or two after Ubuntu released theirs. Ubuntu 13.04 was released in April, so it is not surprising to see Linux Mint 15 released in late May. We have always love Linux Mint and think that it is more suitable for newbie than Ubuntu. If you are a Linux Mint user, I am sure you love its interface and ease of use as well. Let’s check out what’s in store for Linux Mint 15.

For Linux Mint 15, there are two versions that you can download. One comes with the Cinnamon desktop while another comes with the MATE desktop. MATE is more suited for older laptop with less resources, but in most cases, Cinnamon works fine too. In this review, we will be using the Cinnamon version.
 
## Download and Installation
 
You can download the ISO image from the Linux Mint site. Depending on your system architecture, you can download either the 32 or 64 bit version. The installation is pretty straightforward. Except for the graphical difference, the installation process is exactly the same as Ubuntu.
 
Once the installation is completed, reboot the system. The first to greet you after the bootup is the MDM login screen. The advantage of MDM over LightDM (the login manager used by Ubuntu) is that MDM is more customizable and since it is compatible with GDM themes, there are tons of beautiful themes that you can find online.
 

 
What’s new in this MDM login screen is that it comes with 3 different types of greeter. You can use the GTK greeter, or GDM greeter. There is also the HTML greeter where you can use HTML5, CSS, Javascript, WebGL to customize the layout and functionality.
 
The default greeter is the HTML. You can go to the “Login Screen” option in the Cinnamon Control Center to change to GTK or GDM greeter, and to apply new login theme. 
 
If none of the themes in the list catch your attention, you can go to Gnome-look and download the theme you like.
 
## MintSources: A better way to manage your software sources
 
The new Linux Mint 15 comes with a new MintSources application that replaces the “Software Sources” in Ubuntu. The MintSources adds more features to the Software Sources. You can now change the mirror of your Linux Mint (and Ubuntu base) repository, and also add new PPAs, additional repositories, authentication keys, right in the application. No longer do you need to hit the terminal just to add a new PPA and install new application. You can now do everything right from the MintSources.
 
The coolest thing that I like about Mint Sources is that it lets you know which mirror loads the fastest so you know which one to choose from the list. 
 
There is also a Maintenance option where you can “Fix MergeList problems” and “Purge residual configuration”. Both options provide a one-click solution to clean up your system.
 
 
 
## Desklets
 
Desklets are widgets that you can place in the desktop. There are 3 desklets installed by default (Clock, Digital Photo frame and Launcher desklets) and you can find more desklets online (as of this post, there are only 4 desklets online. Hopefully, the list will expand). I am not a fan of desktop widgets, but I guess a lot of people will love it, particular one that shows the weather condition.
 
## Screensaver
 
Linux Mint now comes with its own screensaver, which is simply a clock widget floating around the screen. One feature that was added was the ability to specify your own message when the screensaver is active. A simple, yet useful feature.
 
## Cinnamon Control Center
 
All the system settings are now accessible from the Cinnamon Control Center. The Gnome Control Center is no longer included.  All the features mentioned above can also be accessible from the Cinnamon Control Center.
 
## Conclusion
 
Functionally, Linux Mint 15 is similar to its previous version. Nothing much has changed that will affect your workflow greatly. However, it is those small details that make Linux Mint 15 shines. A lot of efforts were put in to improve the user experience and make it easier to use. I always think Linux Mint is great for Linux beginners and Linux Mint 15 further strengthens my view.
