Title: You Won't Believe Why the Adhesive On Ifixit's New Battery Isn't Sticking to Older Macbook Pro Models!

Introduction:
Ifixit recently released a new battery for older MacBook Pro models that has been causing some confusion among customers. Many are finding that the adhesive on the battery isn't sticking properly, causing the battery to move around inside the laptop. So, what's causing this issue?

Background:
Before we dive into the issue at hand, let's go over some background information. Ifixit is a popular website that sells repair parts and provides instructional guides on how to fix various electronics, including laptops. Apple's MacBook Pro is a laptop model that has been around for over a decade, with various versions and updates throughout the years. Ifixit's new battery is made specifically for some of the older MacBook Pro models, dating back to 2009.

The Issue:
The adhesive on Ifixit's new battery isn't sticking properly, causing the battery to move around inside the laptop. This issue only seems to occur on some of the older MacBook Pro models, specifically those with a removable battery compartment. The battery compartment on these models is made of a rubber material that can break down over time, causing the adhesive to lose its grip.

The Solution:
If you're experiencing this issue with Ifixit's new battery, don't worry, there's a solution. Ifixit recommends cleaning the battery compartmeBynt thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol, allowing it to dry completely, and then applying a double-sided adhesive tape on the battery before installing it. This extra step should provide enough sticking power to keep the battery in place.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, if you're trying to replace the battery in your older MacBook Pro using Ifixit's new battery, be aware that you may encounter some issues with the adhesive not sticking properly. However, with the solution provided by Ifixit, this issue is easily remedied. By cleaning the battery compartment and using double-sided adhesive tape, your new battery should stay securely in place.

## Chosen Solution
 Has anybody else had this issue? Replaced the stock battery following ifixit video and all went perfectly except I now notice the battery didn’t stick to the chassis. So now it flops around inside when I carry the laptop.   Wondering if this battery is old stock, or adhesive is from a bad lot.

 Open it up and feel the adhesive.  The stock would have to be pretty old for the adhesive to not stick.
Also make sure the chassis is completely cleaned of dust and old adhesive from the previous battery.  Dirty chassis will make new adhesive not sticky.
Worst case you can buy some double sided adhesive, I’d recommend red tape for it, and re-adhere battery to the chassis if the above doesn’t help.

 Same for me. The chassis was perfectly cleaned and dried. Battery is quite new. According to the specs it is two months old. After few days it’s just all over the chassis.

 I’m actually having the exact same issue with my Late 2013. New iFixit battery but shows MFG date of Novmber 2019, and it’s July. though I put it in a while back It only stayed adhered for maybe a couple of days and that was it, now it flops all over. Going to try some tape and maybe something to shim it up from the bottom case just to keep it from rattling. Rather annoying, and bottom case was clean as could be with alcohol and the adhesive remover that was used to remove the battery. Or perhaps the ones from 2019 had some adhesive issues? This thread is from the exact same timeframe as my battery’s date of manufacture.

 Exactly same problem here. I’ve cleaned it quite well using the included adhesive remover before putting  in the new battery. I think that the reason why it happens is because there is a tension created by the plastic frame of the battery, pushing against the macbook’s frame. So the battery doesn’t lay evenly and adhesive can’t do its job. I think that the adhesive layer should be much thicker to compensate it.
Not sure what to do. I am afraid doing any DIY because of the high temperatures and potential expansion of the battery.

 Yes, just replaced my 2015 MacBook Pro battery with the ifixit battery. Cleaned old adhesive completely but the new battery is obviously clunking around. Hope it doesn’t damage the new trackpad cable.
