Is Your Asus Ux331Un Losing Battery Life Fast? Blame It on this Surprising Culprit - High Definition Audio Device in Modern Standby Mode!

If you're an Asus Ux331Un user and have been noticing a fast battery drain, it could be due to a surprising culprit - the High Definition Audio Device in Modern Standby Mode. This device often runs in the background, draining your battery without you realizing it. In this article, we'll dive deeper into how this device affects your battery life and what you can do to fix it.

First, let's understand what Modern Standby Mode is. It's a new feature in Windows 10 that allows your laptop to stay connected to the internet, sync data, and receive updates while it's in sleep mode. It works by allowing specific devices to remain active even when the laptop is in sleep mode. The High Definition Audio Device is one such device that remains active in Modern Standby Mode to allow your laptop to play audio even while it's asleep.

While this feature might seem useful, it can lead to a fast battery drain since the High Definition Audio Device is continuously running in the background. This device can consume up to 1% of your laptop's battery every hour, even when it's not in use.

So, what can you do to fix this issue and save battery life? Firstly, you can disable Modern Standby Mode altogether. While disabling this feature will mean that your laptop won't be able to stay connected to the internet or sync data while it's in sleep mode, it will save you a considerable amount of battery life.

To disable Modern Standby Mode, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Windows search bar and type "Control Panel."

2. Click on "Power Options."

3. Click on "Choose what closing the lid does."

4. Click on "Change settings that are currently unavailable."

5. Uncheck the box next to "Turn on fast startup (recommended)."

6. Click on "Save changes."

7. Restart your laptop.

Alternatively, you can disable the High Definition Audio Device in Modern Standby Mode specifically. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Windows search bar and type "Device Manager."

2. Expand the "System devices" menu.

3. Find "High Definition Audio Controller" and click on it.

4. Right-click on "High Definition Audio Controller" and choose "Properties."

5. Navigate to the "Power Management" tab.

6. Uncheck the box next to "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."

7. Click on "OK."

8. Restart your laptop.

In conclusion, the High Definition Audio Device in Modern Standby Mode can be a surprising culprit for a fast battery drain on your Asus Ux331Un. By disabling Modern Standby Mode or the High Definition Audio Device specifically, you can save a considerable amount of battery life on your laptop. We hope this article has been helpful in solving your battery issues!


## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys, been having this for a long time from my  newly bought laptop. There's a huge battery drain (2-3% per hour) when I put my laptop to sleep (Modern Standby). After running Sleep Study I've found out that it's mainly due to  High Definition Audio Device.
I've tried :
Updating my Realtek DriversUninstalling Realtek and using generic driversLooked up all over forums, but the problem others have is about "Audio stream is currently in use" - which isn't what I have encountered.
Here is my sleepstudy report attached, Any help please?


Update (06/09/2018)
Hi guys !
So I disabled my Realtek drivers.
Interestingly the fault still shows up as Audio device, but my device drain has been 0% for the past 9 hours!
Not sure if this is normal, I'll do another round of tests.
In the meantime- any ideas on what is going on here?
Cheers guys!

 hi guys,
just a quick update- i've given up on this. speakers are the problem and it doesn't seem like a driver issue, could be one on some other software bug.
I've given up on this and have resorted to shutting down the computer :"(

 Have the same problem on my new ASUS Zenbook. Reached out to support 3 times, spoke with 4 different techs, as well as myself who is in IT and one of my buddies. This happens when headphones are plugged in.  ASUS solution is to restore to factory default, but, it has been doing it since I bought it. Now it is ship it to them, but, I am sure this is more of a common problem than they think.
Disabling the Audio Drivers ultimately turns of the sound all together which does not seem to be an viable option. Simple thing unplug the headphones or have the battery drain 10% every 2 hour, as opposed to 1%.
