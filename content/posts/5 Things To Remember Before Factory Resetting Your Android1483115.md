TITLE: WARNING: Don't Factory Reset Your Android Without Reading These 5 Critical Tips First!

If you're experiencing issues with your Android device, such as slow performance, frequent crashes, or malware infections, it might be tempting to factory reset your phone or tablet to restore its original state. But before you hit the reset button, there are a few critical tips you should consider to avoid losing important data, damaging your device, or compromising your security.

Here are five essential things to consider before factory resetting your Android device:

1. Backup Your Data

The first and most crucial step before factory resetting your device is to backup your data. This includes your contacts, messages, photos, videos, music, and any other files you want to keep safe. There are several ways to backup your data, including using cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive, or transferring the files to a computer or an external hard drive.

2. Remove Your SIM and SD Cards

Before resetting your device, remove your SIM card and SD card if you have one. SIM cards contain sensitive information like your phone number, contacts, and other personal details that you don't want to lose or expose to unauthorized parties. Also, take out your SD card if you have one, as it may contain files that you want to keep safe, like photos, videos, and music.

3. Disable Factory Reset Protection

If your device has Factory Reset Protection (FRP) enabled, you'll need to disable it before performing a factory reset. FRP is a security feature introduced in Android 5.1 Lollipop that requires you to enter your Google account credentials after a factory reset to verify your identity and prevent unauthorized access to your device. To disable FRP, go to Settings > Security > Google > Security > Factory Reset Protection and turn it off.

4. Verify Your Google Account Details

Before factory resetting your device, make sure your Google account details are correct, and you have access to your password and recovery email address. This is crucial if you have FRP enabled and need to verify your identity after the reset. Check your Google account settings to ensure your phone number, recovery email, and password are updated and accurate.

5. Use the Right Method

Finally, make sure you use the right method to factory reset your device. There are two ways to perform a factory reset on Android: through the device's settings menu or by using a hardware button combination. The former is the most common and easiest method, but it may not work if your device is bricked, locked, or unresponsive. The latter method involves pressing a specific combination of buttons on your device during startup to access the recovery mode, where you can perform a factory reset. Make sure you follow the right procedure for your device model and brand.

In Conclusion

Factory resetting your Android device can be a quick fix for many issues, but it's not a decision to be taken lightly. Before hitting that reset button, ensure you've backed up your files, removed your SIM and SD cards, disabled FRP, verified your Google account details, and used the right method for your device. These tips will help protect your valuable data, minimize the risk of damage or security breaches, and ensure a smooth factory reset experience.

During the stone age, a mere wooden stick may have been considered a prized possession but it’s all about smartphones in the 21st century. Irrespective of demographic variables which vary among different regions of the globe, smartphone usage can definitely be regarded as a common factor among humans today.
 
“With greater technologies comes greater issues” and one of the issues we face today is the disruption of our perfectly balanced life due to smartphone issues. Smartphones have obviously become few of the most important objects without which survival in today’s world would be next to impossible.
 
One of the best solutions recommended for software issues is to do a factory reset for which one of the prerequisites includes taking a regular backup of your smartphone data. This would also prove beneficial in case of physical damage, theft or exchanging your phone for a newer one. But before taking this one major step solution of factory reset there are a few preliminaries that one should not avoid.

### 1. Backup
 

 
Cambridge dictionary defines backup as “ a copy of information held on a computer that is stored separately from the computer “. This definition becomes relevant when the word ‘computer’ is substituted by the word ‘smartphone’. Before performing a factory reset, one must take a backup of the contacts, SMSs, app purchases, calendar, photos etc. Google has the technology to carry out automatic backup, if the required permission has been provided. However, sometimes it is advisable to take matters in your own hands and for that it is important to know as to what should be backed up.
 
a) Contacts
 
These include all the telephone numbers of people you communicate with. Generally, they are saved in your sim card and are visible after you reset your phone or purchase a new one, but there are times when the contacts are saved in your phone memory instead.
 
- To avoid loss of those precious contacts, Google has provided a facility of Backup & Restore which once synced will not only save your contacts but also calendar, photos and music to its servers. This can be achieved with two or three taps and restored back on your formatted or new device. Before resetting, ensure all your data has been backed up recently by heading over to Settings > Accounts (tap Google) > Select Google account > check everything you want to sync.
 - Alternatively, you can export a .vcf file to your SD card/Flash drive and import the same file on your formatted or new phone. This can be done by your default ‘Contacts’ app.

 
b)  SMS
 
If you want to view your valuable SMS texts, as they were before formatting your smartphone, the only option is to take a backup. For this you would need a third-party app which would save all your messages on your Google drive and then restore them later. I recommend using SMS Organizer from Microsoft Corporation which would not only backup and restore your messages but also organize them as per their content into predefined folders like spam, personal, transaction etc.
 
c) App Data. Some apps like ‘WhatsApp’ provide in-app backup features where all the chats and content can be backed up on Google Drive and later restore once you install WhatsApp back on your formatted phone. Apart from some software, it is not recommended to take a backup of all apps as one of them might be reason for the non-smooth functioning of the device which led to the factory reset in the first place.
 
### 2. Copy Files and Folders
 
Before resetting your smartphone, it is recommended to connect your phone to an external storage drive. A few basic mobile accessories would be required such as:
 
A) SD card/Flash drive with OTG connector. Make sure that the smartphone supports OTG data transfer and the drive is not less than 16 GB.
 
or
 
B) Data cable. All new chargers come in two units, a wall socket with USB Port and a wire with USB and Micro USB connector. The USB connector can be inserted into the computer’s USB port which would then access the smartphone as an external drive.
 
The main purpose of this would be to copy your smartphone content which include media files like photos, audio and video files, documents like eBooks, pdfs, spreadsheets etc. and miscellaneous files like installation files (.apk), contact files (.vcf) and other app specific files.
 
 
 
### 3. Battery percentage must be more than 70%
 
If you want to do a factory reset on your android phone, make sure that the phone battery is above 70% to ensure a smooth formatting. If the phone runs out of power while reset, it could lead to a bricked phone.
 
### 4. List of apps and Screenshots
 
One of the easiest ways to restore the previous look of your smartphone is to make a list of all the important third-party apps which can be installed later by logging into the Play Store > My apps and games > Library. Also screenshots of all the home screens and application launcher screens can help you to redesign your formatted smartphone back to the way you wanted.
 
### 5. Exit Micro SD card
 
The final step after taking all backups and copying all files, is to remove any MicroSD card from your smartphone to avoid accidental deletion of files on the card during factory reset operation.
 
Factory reset is an irreversible action. One must take heed and exercise caution while carrying out this process and it is always recommended to back up your data to Google servers so that it can be restored later. Alternatively, backup can be done on the SD card and most OEMs today provide backup facilities to their respective cloud servers as well.
