If you own a 2015 Jeep Renegade, you know how important it is to have a functioning rear windshield wiper. Not only does it improve visibility during rainy or snowy weather, but it also helps you maintain a clear line of sight while driving. But what happens when your wiper blade starts to deteriorate or become damaged? Replacing it may seem like a daunting task, but it's actually quite simple. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps required to replace the rear windshield wiper on your 2015 Jeep Renegade.

##What you'll need
Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools on hand:

- New rear windshield wiper blade
- Flathead screwdriver
- Pair of pliers

##Steps to replace the rear windshield wiper blade
1. Remove the old wiper blade: Start by lifting the rear windshield wiper arm off the windshield and locating the small tab at the base of the wiper blade. Gently lift the tab with a flathead screwdriver and slide the blade away from the arm.
2. Prepare the new wiper blade: Take your new wiper blade and make sure it matches the size and style of your previous blade. Many auto parts stores will have a guide that will help you select the correct blade for your Jeep Renegade. Once you have the right blade, slide it onto the wiper arm, making sure it snaps into place.
3. Tighten the arm: Once the new blade is in place, use a pair of pliers or your hands to tighten the arm onto the blade. Be sure not to over-tighten, as this could damage the blade or the arm.
4. Test the wiper blade: Test your new wiper blade by turning on your Jeep's wiper system and ensuring it operates smoothly and efficiently.

And that's it! Replacing the rear windshield wiper blade on your 2015 Jeep Renegade doesn't have to be a complicated task. With the right tools and a little patience, you can have a new blade installed in no time. By following these simple steps, you'll ensure that your Jeep Renegade is ready for whatever weather comes your way.
