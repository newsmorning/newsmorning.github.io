## Chosen Solution
 I have a TOSHIBA 32L5650VN, Opera TV powered smart TV. Every TV has a way to access the Service Mode. BUT I CAN’T. I TRIED EVERY METHOD AVAILABLE
(Mute button method, 9302 method and else…). Please, if you know the way to access the service mode, write it. THANKS

 @xwintech since we do not know what methods you found lets start with finding common ground so we do not have to guess a lot. Try these and let us know.

Remember that you are dealing with a Toshiba device. Toshiba is just as friggin paranoid as Apple, Vizio and John Deere and will be of no assistance at all.

 Press menu button and 4725 that should work but I've tried changing the things but it won't let me
