If you own an iPhone 4S, you may be shocked to learn that it performs a series of mysterious actions every time you turn it on. These actions are so secret and hidden that many iPhone owners may not even realize what is going on.

So what exactly is happening when you turn on your iPhone 4S? According to recent research, your device is going through a secret process known as "Self-Diagnostics."

Self-Diagnostics is a process that occurs during the boot up phase of your iPhone. When you turn on your device, before the Apple logo appears, your iPhone is performing a series of checks to ensure that all hardware components are functioning properly.

During this process, your iPhone is checking the display, camera, and other components to ensure that they are working correctly. If any of the hardware components fail to pass the test, your iPhone will display an error message indicating the issue.

Additionally, your iPhone will perform a thermal calibration during the boot-up process. This process involves measuring the internal temperature of your device and adjusting the performance of the CPU and battery accordingly.

It's important to note that Self-Diagnostics is only applicable to iPhone 4S devices. Newer models of the iPhone no longer go through this process during boot up.

Many iPhone users may not even realize this process is happening since it occurs so quickly. If you want to see the Self-Diagnostics process in action, you can hold down the Home button while turning on your iPhone. This will cause your device to display a white screen with the Apple logo in the center.

In conclusion, if you own an iPhone 4S, it's fascinating to learn about the secret Self-Diagnostics process that occurs every time you turn on your device. While it may seem like a small detail, understanding how your iPhone works can help you better maintain and troubleshoot your device in the future.

## Chosen Solution
 My iPhone has some white/yellow/blue lines when turning on or unlocking, and some white/black faded lines across the screen with some text. Is this a screen issue, or something worse? And either way, what parts will I need to fix?
