Title: Revive Your Old MacBook with These Genius Battery Hacks - Say Goodbye to Core 2 Duo Battery Woes!

Introduction:
Apple makes high-quality, long-lasting devices, but even the best batteries eventually start to degrade with age. If you're still using an older MacBook model with a Core 2 Duo processor, you're likely experiencing battery problems. The good news is that there are some simple hacks you can use to revive your old MacBook and extend its battery life. In this article, we'll show you how to get the most out of your old MacBook with these genius battery hacks.

Section 1: Understand Your Battery Life
Before you dive into the hacks, it's important to understand how your MacBook's battery life works. Apple's batteries are designed to last for a certain number of charge cycles. After this point, the battery capacity starts to degrade, and you'll notice a shorter lifespan. You can check your battery cycles by clicking on the Apple icon in the top left corner, selecting "About This Mac", clicking "System Report," and finally, "Power." 

Section 2: Reduce the Brightness 
Dimming your screen brightness is one of the easiest ways to extend your MacBook's battery life. Go to "System Preferences", "Displays", and lower the brightness of the screen. You'll notice the battery life in your MacBook will significantly increase.

Section 3: Turn Off Energy-Hungry Settings and Applications
The MacBook's Core 2 Duo processor is outdated, and it can struggle to handle modern, energy-intensive applications. Closing applications and tabs that you're not currently using can reduce the burden on your battery. You can also turn off energy-hungry settings such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and the backlit keyboard. By disabling these features, you'll save battery life.

Section 4: Perform A Battery Calibration
Calibrating your MacBook's battery is important to ensure that your device is accurately reading your battery's charge level. To do this, fully charge your MacBook, unplug it, and use it until the battery drains completely. Once it shuts down, wait a few hours before recharging it back to 100%. By performing this calibration, you'll ensure an accurate reading of your battery life.

Section 5: Replace Your Battery
If your MacBook's battery is too far gone or doesn't hold a charge any longer, consider replacing it with a new one. You can purchase a new battery from Apple or third-party sellers. Some models allow you to replace the battery yourself, but in other cases, you'll need to take it to a professional.

Conclusion:
There's no reason to suffer from short battery life on an older MacBook. By implementing these simple, yet effective battery hacks, you can extend the life of your device and get more use out of it. Remember to know your battery's cycle count, reduce the brightness, turn off energy-hungry settings and applications, perform a battery calibration, and even replace the battery if it's necessary. Say goodbye to your Core 2 Duo battery troubles and get your MacBook running smoothly again!

## Chosen Solution
 Some time ago my Model A1181 Macbook started to refuse to charge its battery.  I have replaced the battery (new) and the battery interface cable/board (used) to no effect.
The magsafe connector is almost always green.  It is not green for about a minute after boot or a minute after I plug in the battery.  It thinks for this minute and then decides the battery does not exist.  Black X. Despite this, starting with a running laptop plugged in to AC power with a charged battery.... the computer draws power (runs happily) from the battery it doesn't think exists when you unplug the AC power. I have tried all of the various resets and battery updates.
Is there anything which could be broken on the motherboard or hacked to become fixed?
From system profiler during the minute where its thinking about whether the battery exists:
Battery Information:
Charge Information:
Charge remaining (mAh):    0
Fully charged:    No
Charging:    Yes
Full charge capacity (mAh):    0
Health Information:
Cycle count:    0
Condition:    Normal
Battery Installed:    Yes
Amperage (mA):    0
Voltage (mV):    0

 Resolution
Shut down, then remove and reinstall the battery. Test for the issue(s) again.
Connect the MagSafe power adapter (if you haven't already) and see if the behavior continues.
If the issue(s) persist, download and install the Mac OS X v10.4.9 Update.
If the issue(s) persist, download and install Battery Update 1.3.
If, after installing the Mac OS X v10.4.9 Update and Battery Update 1.3, a black "X" still appears in the menu bar, follow the steps in MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air: Battery not recognized after being fully drained.
If the battery charge status still shows zero percent, yet appears to show a nearly full charge shortly thereafter, see Calibrating your computer's battery for best performance.
