Not only does it give access to new features, but it also enables the player to craft higher tier items and increase their experience gain. With this simple trick, players can upgrade their lab without spending any extra resources or wasting any time.

First and foremost, make sure to complete all the lab quests available to you. These quests will provide you with necessary resources such as lab points, which are essential for upgrading the lab. Once you have sufficient resources, it's time to use that simple trick - reset your lab level.

Once you reset your lab, all lab points, items, and resources you've previously acquired will be returned to you.

Now that you've reset your lab, you can obtain rewards and resources faster by repeating lab quests and missions. In this process, focus on the higher-tier quests to gain more resources and move up the ranks quickly.

Repeat this process until you reach level 3. Once you've hit level 3, you will see the benefits of your efforts. You can craft higher tier items, earn more experience points, and access new features such as advanced blacksmithing and engraving.

To summarize, upgrading your lab to level 3 is a crucial step in gaining ultimate power in Lost Ark. However, it can be a time-consuming and resource-draining process. To fast-track this process, reset your lab level and repeat the lab quests to obtain resources and level up quickly.
