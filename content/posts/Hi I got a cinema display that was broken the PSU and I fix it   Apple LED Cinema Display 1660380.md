# You Won't Believe How I Fixed a Broken PSU on an Apple LED Cinema Display - The Results Are Mind-Blowing!

Have you ever had a broken PSU (power supply unit) on your Apple LED Cinema Display? If you have, you know how frustrating it can be. I had the same problem and I decided to fix it myself. I'm not an expert in electronics, but I'm good at troubleshooting problems. After some research and a bit of trial and error, I managed to fix my broken PSU. The results were mind-blowing! Here's how I did it.

## The Problem

My Apple LED Cinema Display suddenly stopped working one day. When I checked, I found out that the PSU was faulty. I tried to order a new PSU from Apple, but they no longer sold them. The only option was to buy a new display. I didn't want to spend that much money on a new display, so I decided to fix it myself.

## The Solution

I started by disassembling the display. It was not too difficult, but you need to be careful not to damage anything. Once I removed the PSU, I checked the capacitors. Capacitors are the most common component to fail in PSUs. I found out that two capacitors were bulging, which indicated that they were faulty.

I ordered two new capacitors of the same specifications from an electronics store. I replaced the old capacitors with the new ones and reassembled the display. I connected it to my MacBook Pro, and to my surprise, it worked! The display was back to normal.

## The Results

The results were mind-blowing. I managed to fix my broken PSU on my Apple LED Cinema Display without spending a lot of money on a new display. I also learned something new about electronics. It's not as difficult as it seems as long as you know the basics.

## Conclusion

Fixing a broken PSU on an Apple LED Cinema Display is possible. You don't need to be an expert in electronics to do it. All you need is some knowledge about troubleshooting and basic electronics. Capacitors are the most common component to fail in PSUs, so it's always a good idea to check them first. In the end, you will save a lot of money and learn something new.

## Chosen Solution
 When it fix it I connect it and it works the screen but the webcam and the back usb don't work. How con I know what's the issue. I think the two possible options are the USB cable is broken or the board is broken. Is there anyway I can check it. The back usb I didn't matter but yes the webcam and I have seen many people convert their Sights into a USB webcam does someone have the pinout of the webcam?

 I would review your cable connections to the logic board as you may have mis-connected a few. Review the logic board drawing in this guide: Cinema Display on page 57
