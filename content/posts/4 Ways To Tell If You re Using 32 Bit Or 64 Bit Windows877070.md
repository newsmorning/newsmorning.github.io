# Is Your Computer Running on 32 or 64 Bit? Find Out in 4 Easy Steps Now!

Are you wondering if your computer is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system? It's important to know whether your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit because it affects the performance and compatibility of your system. Some software programs are designed to work only with 32-bit or 64-bit systems. In this article, we'll show you four easy steps to determine if your computer is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.

## Step 1: Open System Properties

To determine if your computer is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system, you need to open the System Properties window. There are several ways to do this, but the simplest method is to right-click on the "This PC" icon on your desktop and select "Properties" from the drop-down menu.

## Step 2: Check the Installed Memory (RAM)

Once the System Properties window is open, look for the "Installed memory (RAM)" section. If your computer is running on a 32-bit operating system, it will display a value of 4GB or less. If your computer is running on a 64-bit operating system, it will display a value of 4GB or more.

## Step 3: Check the System Type

Next, look for the "System type" section on the System Properties window. This section displays information about whether your computer is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system. If your computer is running on a 32-bit operating system, it will display "32-bit operating system" under the System type section. If your computer is running on a 64-bit operating system, it will display "64-bit operating system" under the System type section.

## Step 4: Check the Processor Information

Finally, you can also determine if your computer is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system by checking the processor information. To do this, scroll down to the "System" section of the System Properties window and look for the "Processor" information. If your computer is running on a 32-bit operating system, it will display an "x86-based processor" under the Processor section. If your computer is running on a 64-bit operating system, it will display an "x64-based processor" under the Processor section.

In Conclusion

Determining whether your computer is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system is important because it can affect the performance and compatibility of your system. By following the four easy steps outlined in this article, you can quickly determine if your computer is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system. Knowing this information can help you make better decisions about the software and hardware you install on your computer.

Although we’re gradually transitioning into a fully 64-bit PC world, not everyone is currently running a 64-bit version of Windows. Knowing if your Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit is important when it comes to installing some software, especially drivers.
 
Finding
out if you’re running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows isn’t difficult,
though, and there are multiple ways for you to do so. In this
article, let’s look at four of the most simple and easy ways to
determine which version of Windows is running on your PC.
 
### System Information
 
My
pick for the simplest and most straightforward way to determine if
you’re using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows lies within Windows’ system
information.
 

 
To locate this, press the Windows + X keys, then click on System. A new About window will pop up, first showing your PC’s protection status. 
 
Halfway down this page, you’ll find the Device Specifications heading.
 
Here,
the information listed as your System Type will plainly state
which version of Windows you’re running.
 
### Command Prompt
 
Another
simple way to figure out the architecture of your processor and if
you’re running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows is by using the Command
Prompt.
 
Type cmd into the search bar of your Windows Start Menu. The best match should be Command Prompt. Rather than opening it like you would normally, right-click on the search result and select Run as Administrator.
 
When the Command Prompt terminal has opened, type in the set pro command. After hitting the Enter key, the prompt will return a list of information about your machine’s processor and operating system. 
 
Here, there are three ways to determine which version of Windows you’re running:
 
- PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE
 - PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER
 - ProgramFiles(x86)

 
The processor-specific flags should indicate whether you’re using a 32-bit or 64-bit processor. 
 
Unless you’ve changed your PC’s hardware, the presence of the ProgramFiles(x86) flag should tell which version of Windows you’re running. This will only appear if you’re on a 64-bit version of Windows.
 
### Program Files
 
This
simple trick is a spinoff of the Command Prompt method. Again, if
your machine has never gone through a hardware change since
installing Windows, the presence of multiple Program Files folders
tells you everything that you need to know.
 
First,
navigate to your C: drive in Windows Explorer.
 
If you’re running a 32-bit version of Windows, you should only see the Program Files folder (and all programs inside of it will be 32-bit). 
 
However, for 64-bit versions of Windows, the Program Files folder will contain 64-bit applications, while the Program Files (x86) folder will contain all 32-bit applications.
 
The 64-bit versions of Windows have backward compatibility with 32-bit applications, but the 32-bit versions of Windows cannot run 64-bit applications. This is why the folders are structured this way. 
 
If you’d like to know more, check out Help Desk Geek’s article explaining why 64-bit Windows needs two Program Files folders.
 
### Task Manager
 
While
this method takes a bit more effort than the others, it also provides
information specific to the applications you’re currently running.
 
- To get started, press the Windows + X keys, then click on Task Manager. Another common shortcut is by pressing the Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys.When the Task Manager window pops up, the first thing you need to do is be sure that you’re seeing the full details. In the bottom-left corner, if it reads Fewer details then you are. If it reads More details, click the arrow icon to the left of this text to expand this window.Now, switch to the Details tab. By default, the information we need to see is not shown here. To display it, right-click on any of the column headings (Name, PID, etc.) and click on Select Columns. In this window, fill in the checkbox beside Platform and click the OK button.

 
There will now be a Platform column that displays the software architecture of each of your running processes. 
 
It should quickly be easy to figure out which version of Windows you’re running based on this: 32-bit will have no 64-bit applications shown, while 64-bit versions of Windows are apparent if even a single application is 64-bit.
 
As
the number of newly released systems running a 32-bit architecture
continue to plummet, the confusion between 32-bit and 64-bit versions
of Windows will become less of a problem. Until then, though, it’s
better to be safe than sorry!
