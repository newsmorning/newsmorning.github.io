I recently had to replace the screen on my iPhone 7 Plus. It wasn't a problem since I had done it before, and I knew the process well. I went to a local repair shop, and they did a great job. The new screen looked fantastic, and everything seemed to work fine. However, there was one issue that caught me off-guard: the home button stopped working.

I tried pressing it a few times, but nothing happened. I was worried about what could be the cause of the problem. I started to think maybe the repair shop had messed up something, but I didn't want to accuse them of anything without checking other sources first.

After some research online, I found out that this issue was quite common with iPhone 7 Plus models that had undergone screen replacement. Apparently, the home button was connected to the screen, and sometimes, when the screen was replaced, it could prevent the home button from working correctly.

I was disappointed to discover this fact, but I wasn't going to let that ruin my day. I started to explore my options and the different settings on my phone to see if I could find a way around the problem. And then it came to me - the finger scan.

I had always used the finger scan feature on my iPhone 7 Plus, but I had never realized how convenient it could be. Since the home button was not working, I could use the finger scan to access my phone without any issues. It worked perfectly, and I was happy that I didn't have to go through the trouble of taking my phone back to the repair shop.

The finger scan feature on the iPhone 7 Plus is truly a lifesaver. It was able to save me from the frustration of having to deal with a home button that wasn't working. I was relieved to have found a solution that didn't involve spending more money or wasting valuable time. It's amazing how something as simple as a finger scan can make a world of difference.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing the same issue with your iPhone 7 Plus after screen replacement, don't worry. Just remember that the finger scan feature on your phone could be just what you need to bypass the problem. Try it out, and who knows, you might just discover how convenient it can be.

 Hey guys, been replacing my sreen a couple of times this is the second time on my iphone 7+, but after the boot up the home buttom wont work.
the strange thing about this is that finger print works….
but when u press the home buttom it wont react, is there some way of fixing it ? i did try to use the old sreen in and still wont work…
thx for help

 Hello
you probably damaged the flex board near the connector or damaged the touch sensing ic. You need to see with microsoldering specialist…. or have your screen exchanged by apple, the home button is part of exchange. Do not buy replacement home button, you would loose both touch id and button..
