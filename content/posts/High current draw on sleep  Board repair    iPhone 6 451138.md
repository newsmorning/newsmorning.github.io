# Discover the Surprising Reason Why Your iPhone 6 Won't Sleep and How to Fix it Fast!

As an iPhone 6 owner, you may have encountered the frustrating problem of your phone not sleeping when you expect it to. You may have tried adjusting the settings, restarting the device, or even restoring it to factory settings, but the problem persists. 

Well, here's the surprising reason behind this issue: it may be caused by a faulty proximity sensor. Yes, that tiny sensor located near the earpiece of your phone, which is responsible for detecting when you hold your phone to your ear during a call and turning off the screen, might be malfunctioning.

When the proximity sensor is faulty, it fails to detect when the phone is not in use and prevents it from going to sleep, resulting in rapid battery drain and hindered performance. The problem can also manifest in other ways, such as the screen not turning on during calls or the phone not rotating to landscape mode when tilted.

Don't fret, though; there are easy fixes to this problem. Here are a few things you can try:

## Clean the Proximity Sensor

The proximity sensor can get dirty or covered with oil from your face over time, reducing its effectiveness. Try cleaning it with a soft cloth or cotton swab, and see if that helps.

## Remove the Screen Protector

If you have a screen protector, it may be blocking the proximity sensor or interfering with its function. Try removing the protector and see if that fixes the problem.

## Reset the Calibration

Sometimes, the calibration of the proximity sensor can get off, causing it to behave erratically. To reset the calibration, follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings 
2. Tap General 
3. Tap Accessibility 
4. Tap Call Audio Routing 
5. Turn on the Speaker option 
6. Restart your iPhone 

## Replace the Proximity Sensor

If none of the above steps fix the problem, it may be time to replace the proximity sensor altogether. You can take your phone to an authorized service center or a reliable technician to have it fixed professionally. 

In conclusion, a malfunctioning proximity sensor may be the reason your iPhone 6 won't sleep, but that doesn't mean it's the end of the world. Try these simple solutions, and if all else fails, seek professional help. Restored to its full potential, you can enjoy your iPhone 6's outstanding performance and battery life once more.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi there!
So I got an iPhone 6 that came in for BaseBand CPU reball (classic searching no service issue) and battery replacement since it had poor battery life. While I was troubleshooting and ruling out any bad antenna/housing problems I noticed that after the phone is booted and it goes to sleep (locked screen, or stand by, whatever you want to call it) my bench PS showed normal current (low, like 40mA) for two seconds and then went up to 200mA and stayed there. This is very noticeable with the battery since it depletes a full charge in about an hour or so of being asleep.
I decided to do the BB CPU reball with short jumpers hoping that some cracked ball or the phone trying really hard to get signal would solve the issue but it didn't.
Things I've tried:
-Restoring with itunes (clean, no backup)
-New battery (of course)
-Known good battery
No signs of heat or physical damage on the board.
Board looked pristine before I worked on it, and since I see it going down to normal current values I ruled out any full shorts (maybe a parcial short, or full short on some circuit that only activates while the phone goes to sleep)
I have not asked about fake charging cables, but I have not seen this sympthom being Tristar related before, but maybe I'll replace it just to rule it out.
I've never seen this before.
Any ideas will be highly appreciated!
Regards from Argentina, Rodrigo.

 I agree... it is unique. But since Tristar acts as the voltage regulator (in a since)...I think you'd be on the right track there. Did you get your "Searching" issue repaired with u1 and v1 jumpers? or did housing and port make a difference??

 hello,
i have the same problem.draws 0.2A even in the sleep mode and pmic gets warmer gradually. iâ€™ve re-placed tristar 3 times and same problem.even tried new battery.any suggestions?
