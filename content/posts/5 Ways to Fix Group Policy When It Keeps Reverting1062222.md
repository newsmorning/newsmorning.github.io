# Group Policy Reverting Again? Here Are 5 Easy Fixes You Need to Know!

If you have ever administered Windows in a corporate environment, you know the importance of Group Policy. Group Policy is a powerful tool that could help you manage users and computers in your organization effectively. It enables you to enforce security policies, customize settings, and ensure compliance with regulations.

However, if you are experiencing Group Policy reverting again and again, all your efforts in administering the policies could be for nothing. It could make it challenging to maintain a secure and controlled environment, which is the very purpose of Group Policy to begin with. If you are struggling with the issue, here are five easy fixes you need to know.

## 1. Check the Event Viewer

The Event Viewer is a utility that enables you to view logs about your computer's system, security, and application events. It could help you identify what is causing the Group Policy to revert. To check the Event Viewer:

1. Click on the Windows Start menu and type "Event Viewer" in the search box.
2. Open the Event Viewer and navigate to Windows Logs > Application or System.
3. Look for any error or warning messages related to Group Policy.

If you find any errors, you could research the error code to find a solution or contact your system administrator for assistance.

## 2. Ensure that the Group Policy Object (GPO) is linked correctly

Sometimes, GPOs might not be linked correctly to the required Organizational Unit or Domain. If a GPO is not linked correctly, it might not apply, or it might apply partially, causing the Group Policy to revert. To ensure that the GPO is linked correctly:

1. Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
2. Navigate to the OU where the GPO is supposed to link.
3. Right-click the OU and select "Link an Existing GPO."
4. Check that the correct GPO is linked.

## 3. Ensure that there are no conflicting GPOs or settings

Sometimes, conflicting GPOs or settings might cause the Group Policy to revert. For example, if you have one GPO that enables a setting and another GPO that disables the same setting, the Group Policy might revert. To ensure that there are no conflicting GPOs or settings:

1. Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
2. Navigate to the OU where the GPO is supposed to link.
3. Right-click the OU and select "Group Policy Results."
4. Run a Group Policy Results wizard on a test computer to see if there are any conflicts.

## 4. Verify that the Group Policy is not being overwritten by a registry value

Sometimes, registry values could overwrite a Group Policy setting, causing it to revert. To verify this:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows.
3. Check that there are no registry values in the folders that represent the GPOs.

If there are, you could delete them, or modify them to match the GPO settings.

## 5. Ensure that the computer has the latest updates and service packs installed

Sometimes, an outdated computer or server might not apply Group Policy correctly. To ensure that the computer has the latest updates and service packs installed:

1. Click on the Windows Start menu and type "Windows Update" in the search box.
2. Open Windows Update and check for any available updates.
3. Install any updates or service packs that are available.

In conclusion, if you are experiencing Group Policy reverting again, and you have tried troubleshooting unsuccessfully, you might need assistance from your system administrator or support team. However, you could try these five easy fixes to see if they resolve the issue. By carefully administering Group Policy, you could maintain a secure and controlled environment for your organization. Good luck!

Have you encountered an issue where Group Policy keeps reverting? It turns out that this is a common issue. Group Policy settings in Windows are used to keep devices up to date and compliant with settings.
 
## Policy changes are a necessity and here's how to make yours stick
 
- Group Policy can be a powerful tool for managing your Windows environment, but it may also be a bit of a pain when it comes to troubleshooting.
 - If your changes cannot be saved and keep reverting to previous settings, you could have a case of corrupt Group Policy settings on your hands.

However, at times, Group Policy is stuck at applying or keeps reverting the changes you’ve made. This is no fun at all but let’s look at ways to make your changes long-lasting, shall we?
 
## Why do Group Policy settings keep reverting?
 
If you have been working with Group Policy for a while, you may have noticed that every now and then it seems like the policies just don’t stick. After applying Group Policy changes, the next time you log in the policies have reverted back to their previous state. 
 
Wondering why this happens? Here are a few reasons:
 
- Policies not applied correctly – The most common cause of this issue is that policies are not applied correctly. If you have a lot of domain controllers, there can be delays in applying the policies due to replication. This can result in the policies being applied on one domain controller, but not another.
 - Incorrect permissions – To apply Group Policy, your user account must have permission to edit group policies on the target computer. If you don’t have permissions to perform this operation, then any changes made through group policies will be lost until they are applied again by an administrator account.
 - Conflict in GPOs – The Group Policy settings that you have created for your domain can be managed using a tool called the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). This tool allows you to manage the GPOs in your domain, as well as view their settings. If there is a conflict between two GPOs in your network, then GPMC will display an error message and revert the GPOs.
 - Corrupt user profile – If your user profile is corrupted then this can cause issues with group policies. In order for group policies to work properly, all users must have their profile configured correctly. If any of your users’ profiles are corrupt then group policies won’t be applied correctly and will need to be reverted back to their default state.

 
So let’s look at how we can fix it.
 
## How can I fix Group Policy when it keeps reverting?
 
Before you start troubleshooting Group Policy, it’s important to perform preliminary checks to ensure that the problem isn’t something else. To do this, follow these steps:
 
- The first thing you should do is check the time on your computer. If it’s off by more than a few minutes, it can cause problems with Group Policy.
 - Ensure you are using an administrator account. For more insight, check out the difference between an administrator and a standard account.
 - Restart your PC.

 
### 1. Refresh policy settings
 
- Hit the Windows key, type cmd, and select Run as administrator.
 - Type in the following command and press Enter: GPupdate/force

 
### 2. Reset Group Policy Editor
 
- Hit the Windows key, type cmd, and select Run as administrator.
 - Type in the following commands and press Enter after each one: RD /S /Q "%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicyUsers" && RD /S /Q "%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicy" gpupdate /force
 - Restart your PC.

 
### 3. Restart Group Policy Service
 
- Press the Windows + R keys simultaneously to open the Run command.
 - Type in services.msc, then press Enter.
 - Navigate to the Group Policy Client, right-click and select Properties.
 - Select the General tab and change the Startup type to Automatic.
 - Click on Start, then Apply.
 - Hit OK to save the changes.

 
### 4. Use GPMC to troubleshoot
 
GPMC is a great tool for managing Group Policy in your network environment. If you have already installed it but aren’t using it regularly, spend some time learning how to use it properly — it will make managing Group Policy much easier.

### 5. Switch user profiles
 
If users are having problems logging on because of a corrupted registry key, switching their user profiles might fix the issue. This only works if the corruption is local to the computer or if the corruption is being replicated from another domain controller (DC).
 
Remember to set the account as an administrator account to grant it the necessary permissions required to make changes to Group Policy.
 
Sometimes Group Policy gets stuck because of faulty drivers or services that aren’t starting correctly when Windows starts up. 
 
Restarting in Safe Mode will allow them to start without any third-party services running and give you time to troubleshoot any issues with those services before they start up again normally.
 
You may also encounter an issue where Group Policy is slow in generating reports but we have covered how to boost speed in our detailed guide.
 
Also, check out what steps you should take if you find out that your version of Windows doesn’t have the Group Policy Editor.
