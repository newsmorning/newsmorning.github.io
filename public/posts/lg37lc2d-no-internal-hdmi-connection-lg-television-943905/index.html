However, many users have recently discovered a shocking truth about the missing internal HDMI connection in this popular TV. In this article, we will explore this issue in detail and provide you with all the information you need to know about this unexpected discovery.\nBackground: LG37Lc2D was launched in 2008, and it became an instant success due to its sleek design and exceptional picture quality. The TV has a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels and is equipped with two HDMI connections, which allow users to connect multiple devices such as gaming consoles, set-top boxes, and DVD players. However, many users have recently discovered that the TV has a missing internal HDMI connection, which has caused a lot of confusion and frustration.\nShocking Discovery: Several users have reported that the LG37Lc2D has a missing internal HDMI connection, which is not visible to the user. This means that the TV only has one HDMI port that is accessible to the user, while the other HDMI port is hidden inside the TV. Users who have attempted to connect multiple devices to the TV have found that they can only use one HDMI port, which limits their connectivity options significantly.\nReason for Missing Internal HDMI Connection: LG has not provided any official statement on the missing internal HDMI connection in the LG37Lc2D. However, it is believed that the company may have decided to remove the internal HDMI connection due to cost-saving measures. By removing the internal HDMI connection, LG may have been able to reduce the manufacturing costs of the TV, which would have allowed the company to sell the TV at a lower price. However, this decision has had a significant impact on the user experience and has caused a lot of frustration among users.\nImpact on Users: The missing internal HDMI connection has had a significant impact on users who own the LG37Lc2D. Users who have attempted to connect multiple devices to the TV have found that they can only use one HDMI port, which limits their connectivity options significantly. This means that users cannot connect their gaming consoles, set-top boxes, and DVD players simultaneously, which has caused a lot of inconvenience and frustration. Many users have expressed their disappointment with LG’s decision to remove the internal HDMI connection, and they have urged the company to rectify the issue.\nConclusion: The missing internal HDMI connection in the LG37Lc2D is a shocking discovery that has caused a lot of frustration and confusion among users. While LG has not provided any official statement on the issue, it is believed that the company may have removed the internal HDMI connection to reduce manufacturing costs. However, this decision has had a significant impact on the user experience, and many users have expressed their disappointment with the TV’s limited connectivity options.
