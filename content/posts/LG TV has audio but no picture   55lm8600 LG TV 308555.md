# You Won't Believe What Happened When Our LG TV Lost Its Picture! 

## Find Out How We Fixed It Without Breaking the Bank - 55LM8600 LG TV Audio Only Crisis Solved 

Recently, we experienced a crisis with our 55LM8600 LG TV. One day, while we were watching our favorite show, the screen suddenly went blank. The audio was still coming through, but we had no picture. I'm sure many of you have experienced similar issues with your televisions. It's frustrating, isn't it? But what's even worse is the price tag that often comes with fixing the problem. 

We decided to take matters into our own hands and to try and solve the problem ourselves. We did some research, and as it turns out, the issue we were experiencing was a common one. One of the main causes of this problem is a faulty T-CON board. The T-CON board is responsible for converting the video signals and transmitting them to the screen. When this board fails, you may experience a picture loss or other issues, but the audio signal will still come through. 

## Spotting the Problem 

After a little bit of investigation, we found that our T-CON board was indeed faulty. There were clear signs of damage on the board, indicating that it was the problem. We ordered a new T-CON board and replaced the faulty one, which solved our problem. 

## Fixing the Issue 

The process of replacing the T-CON board is relatively simple. Anyone with basic technical knowledge can do it since all you need is a screwdriver and a replacement board. You can easily find a replacement online for a reasonable price. 

If you're not familiar with how to replace the board, there are plenty of tutorials online that can guide you through the process. However, if you're still unsure, it's best to take your TV to a professional repair shop. They may charge more, but they will guarantee that the issue is fixed correctly. 

## Conclusion 

Overall, we're glad that we were able to solve the issue without breaking the bank. The process of replacing the T-CON board was simple, and it saved us a lot of money. We hope that this article will help those of you who are dealing with similar issues with your LG TV. Remember that before you throw out an old TV, it's worth trying to fix it yourself or taking it to a repair shop. You might be surprised at how simple and cost-effective the solution can be.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
It seems as though there is a backlight problem.
Here are some relevant pages from the service manual that may help you to find out where the problem is i.e. the backlights themselves, the PSU or perhaps the mainboard telling the PSU to turn the backlights off.
no video / normal audio troubleshooting flowchart
video error - no video normal audio tests.
expected voltages on the power board Not sure what the voltage should be on pin 18 but this is the pin that the mainboard signals the PSU to either turn on or off the power to the backlights, so maybe you can check its’ value during the brief time that the backlights are on and then when they’re not to see if it changes or not.

 Hi  check ur inner led panel lights power as u can see the image inside with dark.
