It feels like Infinix is launching a new device every other day. And yes, that’s kinda true. In the past few months, we’ve seen the Infinix Zero 8, Infinix Hot 10, Infinix X1 TV among others.
 
Infinix has just announced yet another device coming. This time, the successor to the Infinix Note 7 launched earlier this year.
 
In a bunch of early teasers aimed at drumming up excitement for this device, we get a glimpse of what to expect in the soon to be launched device. Well, devices.
 
According to reports, Infinix is planning to launch not just one, but two devices in the Note 8 lineup. These are the:

See, the Infinix Note 7 received glowing reviews from various quarters including us. So, how does Infinix plan to follow that act with the Note 8 series?
 
The Note 8 series, from what we gathered, is a slight improvement from the Note 7 series. Here are the specs for the Note 8 from what we know so far.
 
## Infinix Note 8 Key Specs
 
Perhaps one of the disappointing aspects of this specsheet is the display. HD+ resolution span out across close to 7-inches results in a pixelated experience as we pointed out in our Note 7 review.
 
While this is acceptable, we were hoping to see at least a 1080p panel. What is not disappointing is the USB-Type C port. It is good to see Infinix sticking to this modern connector.
 
The 5200mAh battery paired with the lower resolution display should result in respectable battery life, an aspect where Infinix Note devices have been known to dominate.
 
In the camera department, the Note 8 sports a dual selfie shooter with a 16MP primary lens and a 2MP portrait sensor. At the back, there’s an array of 4 lenses; a 64MP main, a 2MP Portrait, another 2MP for Macro and an ‘AI Camera’.
 
## Pricing and Availability
 
The Infinix Note 8 family of devices should be available in the country soon but pre-orders are already open starting October 12.
 
To be among the first people to get this device when it drops, you need to visit an Infinix Store with KES 3,000 (down payment). When the device is available, pre-orderers will get a gift hamper with their units worth KES 5,000. 
 
We still don’t have an official RRP but if history is anything to go by, the Note 8 should start at around KES 21,000. 
 
We shall update as soon as we get more inf
