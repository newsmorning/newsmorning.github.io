Title: Dead Rising 4: The Disastrous Zombie Debacle that Crushed Gamers' Hopes - Shocking Reviews Reveal the Bitter Truth!

Introduction:

Zombies have been an ever-present fixture in the world of gaming for years, and over time, game developers have explored various ways to make these brain-eating undead creatures more interesting and challenging. Dead Rising 4, the fourth instalment in the popular zombie franchise, was released with much fanfare in December 2016, but it turned out to be a disappointing experience for many avid gamers. Reviews of the game revealed multiple issues, leading to questions about the future of the series. In this article, we'll explore some of the reasons behind Dead Rising 4's poor gameplay, story and design, and what it means for the future of the franchise.

Weak Storyline:

One of the most significant downsides of Dead Rising 4 is the uninspiring storyline that left gamers feeling underwhelmed. The narrative follows Frank West, a photojournalist who covers the zombie apocalypse in Willamette, Colorado, but it lacks the engaging characters, thought-provoking conversations, and twists and turns that gamers have come to expect. Additionally, the game's cutscenes often lack the cinematic quality necessary to engage the player.

Gameplay Issues:

Dead Rising 4 has been criticised for various gameplay-related problems, including shallow and repetitive missions, lack of innovation, and clunky controls. The escort missions were overly frustrating as Frank has become slower and zombies become stronger. The game also takes place in an open world with no in-game timer, this removes any sense of urgency to obey the game's story, increasing the monotony and boredom of the gameplay. Moreover, the lack of substantive multiplayer mode further agitates gamers who were looking for more engaging modes, co-op, or versus system.

Design Problems:

Dead Rising 4's design problems are well documented, with the most significant issue being that it has strayed too far from its roots. The game prioritizes loot games and weaponry, rather than adding genuine, immersive content. However, the weapons are noticeably weaker than the previous games, and the crafting system lacks variety. The game also lacks creativity in zombie design, and the new zombie type, called Evo zombies, has made the game a little harder but is ultimately annoying.

Conclusion:

Dead Rising 4 may have had many issues, but that doesn't mean the series is dead yet. Game developers have often made mistakes, and it is up to them to learn from their errors and make improvements. The franchise could benefit from a back-to-basics approach, which focuses on the series' original innovative qualities. Players need more variety in weapons and gameplay, more engaging storyline and character development, and a multiplayer mode that rewards teamwork and strategy. It is yet to be seen if the developers will take note of what was wrong with Dead Rising 4 and make the necessary changes to revitalize the franchise.

## What others have said about Dead Rising 4
 
At first look, Dear Rising 4 reviews don’t look great in general. Some sites gave the game an exceptional, or an above average grade, while some went hard on Capcom, calling Dead Rising 4 the worst game of the series. So, let’s finally see what others have said about the game:
 
AngryCentaurGaming – Jeremy Penter – Wait For Sale:
 
CGMagazine – Elias Blondeau – 4 / 10 (XB1):
 
In much the way an MMO needs to be balanced, at times especially with updates, so to does Dead Rising 4. Frank’s faster. Frank’s more deadly. Frank works better overall and does more damage to enemies, and yet it doesn’t feel like the entire game world at all has been upgraded with him, even with the new types of enemy AI. It has some issues with difficulty and they absolutely need to be fixed. I did find myself, at times, unengaged, because the game didn’t require it. […]  Is this a bad game? No, but it is one that’s less connected overall structurally, to the Dead Rising series, and more connected because the creators just sorta tell you it is.
 
COGconnected – Alex Everatt – 80 / 100 (XB1):
 
An unfunny and unfun mess of a game, Dead Rising 4 is a shambling corpse of a once-great franchise. Capcom would be wise to put it out of its misery.
 
GameSpot – Scott Butterworth – 7 / 10 (XB1):
 
Dead Rising 4 took everything that was great about Dead Rising 3, removed the timer, and brought back the franchises most prominent protagonist in a big way. The game isn’t without it’s faults. You’re more than likely going to encounter the occasional glitch, some of which may require reloading a previous checkpoint. The lack of co-op in the main campaign is a huge disappointment, but the separate co-op campaign is an okay compromise (but why not include co-op in both modes?!). Dead Rising 4 is an absolute must for fans of Dead Rising, but if you’ve never played a Dead Rising game before, I would strongly suggest playing the first three Dead Rising games before, otherwise the story might be lost on you.

Polygon – Arthur Gies – 8 / 10 (XB1):
 
Dead Rising’s core combat remains simplistic, but the expanded open world, compelling central mystery, and added combo weapons refresh the formula enough for some light, bloody fun.
 
IGN – Brandin Tyrrel – 8.1 / 10 (XB1, PC):
 
Dead Rising 4 isn’t always smart, but it’s rarely boring
 
Worth Playing – Brian Dumlao – 8 / 10 (XB1):
 
Dead Rising 4 has the best core gameplay the series has ever seen. Its inventive and humorous ways to put down the dead are something I still haven’t tired of, and its surprisingly interesting plot is more than just a zombie-killing delivery system. Despite the technical blemishes that come with the series, its lack of co-op story mode play, and the fun-yet-unreliable multiplayer, Frank West’s return brings the series some fresh ideas, a ton of bloody mayhem, and a whole lot of cracking wise. Here’s hoping he sticks around for a while.
 
It is worth mentioning that Dead Rising 4 received mostly unfavorable reviews on Metacritic. The game has a 4.6 Metacritic score.
 
In the end, Dead Rising 4 is a solid game that is an enjoyable experience for series fans and newcomers. The “use anything, make anything” mechanics that have made zombie-smashing so fun are still intact, and some changes only amplify the experience when dealing with the expansive world. While the story is good on its own, Frank’s presence provides a nice balance between silly and serious, and the multiplayer also finds a sweet spot. The title has some issues, but they aren’t enough to dampen the sheer fun this game provides. DR4 is a worthy pick-up this holiday season.
