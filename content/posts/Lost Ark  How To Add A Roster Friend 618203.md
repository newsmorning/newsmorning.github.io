We understand how frustrating it can be to play multiplayer games without friends. But, worry no more! We bring to you the 5 Epic Tricks to add a roster friend in Lost Ark. Follow these foolproof tips, and you'll never have to play alone again.

## Trick 1: Using the In-Game Friend System

Lost Ark has an in-game friend system that allows you to add friends and create a roster. To add a friend, follow these simple steps:

1. Click on the character menu (by default, it is "C") when you're in the game.
2. Click on the Social tab present at the top of the screen.
3. Click on the "Friends" button present on the left side of the screen.
4. Click on the "Add" button and enter your friend's character name.
5. Click on the "Search" button and send a friend request.

Your friend will receive the friend request, and on accepting it, they will appear on your roster.

## Trick 2: Using Game Forums

Many online gaming forums exist where players can interact, discuss, and find gaming partners. To find a gaming partner on a forum, follow these steps:

1. Search for a Lost Ark online gaming forum on Google.
2. Browse through the forum and look for players who are interested in adding friends to their roster.
3. Send them a private message or reply to their post, asking them to add you as a friend.

This trick will help you find reliable gaming partners who are also looking for friends to add to their roster.

## Trick 3: Using Social Media

Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Discord are excellent mediums that can help you find gaming partners. To use social media to find a gaming partner to add to your roster, follow these steps:

1. Search for Lost Ark groups on Facebook or Discord.
2. Join the group and post about how you're looking for friends to add to your roster.
3. You can also search for players who have posted about wanting new friends and then send them a direct message, asking them to add you.

1. Search for Lost Ark partner-finding websites on Google.
2. Sign up for the website and create a profile.
3. Search for players who are looking for friends to add to their roster, and then send them a request.

This method is a bit risky as some websites are not reliable, and you might end up falling into a trap. Make sure to join reputable websites only.

## Trick 5: Joining a Guild

Joining a guild in Lost Ark is an excellent way to make new friends and find gaming partners. A guild is a group of players who band together to complete quests and activities in the game. To join a guild, follow these steps:

1. Search for guilds on Lost Ark's official website or in-game.
2. Browse through the guild list and apply to the guild that interests you.

## What is A Roster Friend in Lost Ark?
 

 
Say you have a friend with whom you have been playing regularly. But all this while, your friend has more than one character that he plays with. Roster Friend allows you to add all the Lost Ark characters of your friend. So the next time your friend plays with a character that you are not familiar with, you can still play with them.
 
Roster Friend is best used to manage all the characters that one can have. It makes finding your friends much simpler as you won’t have to worry about what character they might be using.
 
### How to Add a Roster Friend
 
Adding a Roster Friend is not that different from adding a friend. Almost the entire process remains the same. Here’s what you need to do to add a Roster Friend:
 
- While in the world of Arkesia in Lost Ark, head to the options at the bottom right and click on Community.
 - Next, from the pop-up window, click on Friends. You can also press U for the same.
 - After that, besides the Friends tab, you have the Requests tab that you need to open.
