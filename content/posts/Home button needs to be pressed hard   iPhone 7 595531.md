As an iPhone user, you may have experienced issues with the home button on your iPhone 7. You press it, but nothing happens, or perhaps you need to press it harder to get it to work. It can be frustrating, especially when you rely on your phone for so many aspects of your daily life. But have you ever wondered why this is happening?

The shocking truth is that the reason behind this issue is not a software problem but a hardware problem. Apple has designed the home button on the iPhone 7 with a new mechanism that requires pressure to be applied for the button to click. This new mechanism is called the "haptic feedback" system.

The haptic feedback system uses a small motor to create a vibration that simulates the feeling of clicking on the home button. This system was introduced as part of Apple's overall plan to ditch the traditional mechanical home button to make the iPhone 7 water-resistant. However, it has caused significant issues for iPhone 7 users.

This issue has been so severe that Apple has implemented an on-screen home button in the latest versions of iOS. This feature is available for users who have experienced problems with their home button and need an alternate method to access their home screen.

But what can you do if you're experiencing issues with your home button and don't want to rely on the on-screen alternative? Here are some suggestions:

1. Restart your phone - This may seem simple, but often restarting your phone can solve many problems, including issues with the home button.

2. Reset your phone's settings - If restarting your phone doesn't work, you may need to reset your phone's settings. This will not affect your data, but it will reset your settings to their factory defaults.

3. Take your phone to an authorized Apple service center - If your home button is still not functioning correctly, take your phone to an authorized Apple service center. They will assess the problem and advise you on the best course of action.

In conclusion, the haptic feedback system on the home button of the iPhone 7 has caused significant problems for users. However, there are ways to fix this issue, and it is important to note that Apple is aware of the problem and is working towards a solution. If you're experiencing issues with your home button, try the suggestions above, and if all else fails, take it to an authorized Apple service center for repair.

## Chosen Solution
 Around two months ago I opened my iPhone 7 to replace the dock assembly. So in order to do that I had to pretty much disassemble everything from the phone. Nonetheless ever since I did that, my phone has been working perfectly fine… until today, as the home button stopped working properly out of the blue.
Now I need to press hard the home button for it to work. As a result I can even see a “rainbow effect” in the screen when I manage to make the home button respond. The touch ID works just fine.
Do I need to retighten something inside the phone? Or is a phone component inside the phone in the need of a new replacement?

 based on your operation, there should have been no need to touch anything on the screen, but as a precaution, i'd remove the home button bracket (4 trilobe screws) and reconnect it.  i don't think it's necessary to disconnect/reconnect the home button connector to the screen, but if you can do it safely, might be worth a try.
other things to consider, make sure the video and button connecters are properly seated.  i don't recall which is which, but if if the connector is just showing bare metal, you might want to get an adhesive foam pads (check the ifixit store) on them to help the bracket hold them in.
other than that, there's not much from a simple troubleshooting standpoint since there's no mechanical action, the button reads something from the presence of a finger to read a "button press" then use the taptic engine to provide the feedback of a click.
it is possible, i've seen it, where the button portion of an Apple home button stops working (or working well) even though the Touch ID is still good.  the only option here is to replace with a 3rd party home button (JC or YF - no bluetooth or soldering required) which gives you home button functionality but you lose Touch ID function, but you do get a working home button again.
Hope this helps
Good luck
