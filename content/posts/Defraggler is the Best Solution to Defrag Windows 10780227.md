# Revamp Your Slow Windows 10 with Defraggler and Experience Lightning Fast Speeds!

Are you using Windows 10, and is your PC running slow? The cause could be fragmentation, which happens as files become fragmented and scattered across the hard drive. This can lead to slower performance as the system struggles to access the fragmented files. Luckily, there's a tool that can make a significant difference - Defraggler!

Defraggler is a free and user-friendly tool from the developers of CCleaner. It works by rearranging fragmented data on your hard drive so that your computer can access files more quickly, resulting in faster performance.

Here's how to use Defraggler to revamp your slow Windows 10 and see lightning-fast speeds:

Step 1: Download and install Defraggler

You can download and install Defraggler from its official website for free. Once downloaded, install the software by following the on-screen instructions.

Step 2: Open Defraggler

After installation, launch Defraggler by double-clicking on the icon on your desktop or by searching for it in the Windows Start menu.

Step 3: Analyze your hard drive

Start by clicking on the 'Analyze' button to get a report on how fragmented your hard drive is. This process may take some time, depending on the size of your drive.

Step 4: Review the report

Once the analysis is complete, you'll see a report that displays how fragmented your hard drive is. Defraggler will suggest the best strategy to optimize your hard drive. Review the report and decide which strategy works best for you.

Step 5: Defragment your hard drive

Once you have selected the best strategy for your hard drive, click on the 'Defrag' button to start defragmentation. This may take some time, depending on the size of your hard drive and how fragmented it is.

Step 6: Monitor the progress

As Defraggler is defragmenting your hard drive, it will display a progress bar indicating how much of the process has been completed. You can monitor the progress and check the estimated time left for defragmentation.

Step 7: Reboot your PC

Once Defraggler has completed defragmentation, reboot your PC. This will allow Windows to update its system files and configurations based on the new layout of your hard drive.

Conclusion

Defragmentation is a crucial process to maintain the optimal performance of Windows 10. By using Defraggler, you can rearrange fragmented data on your hard drive and improve the speed and overall performance of your PC significantly. Follow the above steps to revamp your slow Windows 10 with Defraggler and embrace lightning-fast speeds!

Defraggler is one of the best tools to use if you want to defrag your Windows 8 hard drive or even individual files. I’ve been using it on Windows 8.1, and you can read below what were my impressions

Piriform is a respected company in the software world, probably most known for having released such programs as CCleaner, which is now compatible with Windows 8.1. Piriform is one of the first companies to have released support for Windows 8 for its programs, and Defraggler was made compatible with Windows 8 at the end of January, 2012, even before Windows 8 was released.

The company has respected their schedule and when Windows 8.1 was released, they made Defraggler compatible with Windows 8.1 in version 2.16. But only these days did I install Defraggler as I seriously needed to optimize my Windows 8.1 computer. I’ve used WiseCleaner’s Wise Care 365 software and have also cleaned the Windows 8 registry, but a few more improvements needed to be made.
 
First of all, what makes Defraggler different than other software that can defragment your system is the fact that besides tweaking your hard drive, it can also defrag individual files. The version that I have used, as I’ve mentioned before, was Defraggler 2.16. Let’s have a quick look at its main features, improvements and what it can do for your computer:
 
- Organizes empty disk space to further prevent fragmentation
 - Defragments your hard drive, an entire file, a folder, or a single file
 - Defraggler uses the Windows safeguards to prevent data loss
 - Defraggler is very lightweight, the installation file is only around 3MB
 - Defraggler shows you an interactive drive map
 - Quick Defrag mode
 - Scheduled defragmentation

 
## Using Defraggler to defrag Windows
 
Also, here are some of the latest improvements made to Defraggler – minimize to tray, right-click Move File to end of Drive feature, improvements to dree space calculation, fixed exclusions in df.exe, SSD drives are now handled correctly when drives are queued for defrag, improved drive map block calculation for very small drives, shortcuts are now correctly interpreted when calculating fragmentation levels, improved support for /minpercent parameter for df.exe.
 
With regards to the confusion surrounding SSDs and defragmentation, here’s what Martin Brinkmann from Ghacks explains:
 
When you will first run Defraggler, an interactive map of your drive will be displayed. You will be able to do the following things – analyze, defrag, quick defrag, and also to defrag folders, files and advanced option as checking the drive for errors and defrag freespace. Before running the analyze, it will ask if you want to empty the recycle bin, which, in my case, was around 20 GB (ouch!). So make sure you’ve recovered all the files you might need.
 
There is still some confusion in regards to SSDs and defragmentation. The general consensus seems to be that you should not defragment Solid State Drives for two reasons: first because of the write operations that the operation causes, since it may impact a drive’s lifespan especially if it is an early generation drive. Second, because Solid State Drives can access data a lot faster than regular hard drives so that the performance gains are minimal at best. Running a Trim command or using the secure erase feature of the hard drive will improve performance by a much larger margin.
 
In Defraggler, look at the Media Type column to distinguish regular hard drives from Solid State Drives. It is still recommended to defrag platter-based hard drives whenever their fragmentation reaches a level that is affecting performance. Defraggler does not provide you with any recommendations, but if you spot two-digit fragmentation percentages, you should probably run a defrag on the drive in question.
 
The analysis will be very swift, and will let you know about your disk’s health. After that, you can choose to view the analyzed files or to benchmark a certain drive. On my computer the benchmark lasted for about five minutes. The Windows 8 disk defragmentation will take much more time, so make sure you can keep the computer open. The time estimate will decrease, though, so don’t be afraid. You can stop the process at any time if something unoccured happens.
 


 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.

After the defragmentation was finally completed, I can tell you that my Windows 8.1 laptop suddenly felt faster and snappier. Therefore, I suggest Defraggler as it seems to be, at least in my opinion, the best way do perform disk defragmentation in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Stay tuned as we will soon talk about the performance of Speccy and Recuva programs on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Let’s hope that some day we will also see a Defraggler app optimized for Windows 8 touch devices, as well.

### Defraggler alternatives in Windows 10

- Smart Defrag
 - O&O Defrag
