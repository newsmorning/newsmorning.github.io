# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed My Iphone 5 Screen - Codes And Failures Galore!

## Background

I had been using my trusty Iphone 5 for almost five years, and it had served me well. But like all good things, even my Iphone 5 had to give up on me. I had dropped it on the ground, and the screen had cracked badly. There was no other option but to replace the screen. So, I took my phone to a local repair shop and got the screen replaced.

## The Problems Started

That's when the problems started. The phone turned on without any issues, but as soon as I started using it, I noticed that the touch screen was not working correctly. The phone was behaving weirdly, and there were random taps and swipes happening on the screen even though I wasn't doing anything. I thought I might have missed something during the installation of the new screen and took it back to the repair shop. 

## The Codes and Failures

The repair shop took the phone apart again and checked everything multiple times. They even tried with a different screen, but the issue persisted. They then connected the phone to a computer to try to diagnose the problem. And that’s when we saw it: error codes and fail logs started popping up on the computer screen. There was a whole bunch of codes.

At this point, the repair technician was scratching his head, and I was getting worried. The technician then advised me to take the phone to an Apple store to get it checked by an Apple engineer. And that's exactly what we did.

## Apple to the Rescue

The Apple engineer took one look at the phone and recognized that the replacement screen was a cheap copy that wasn't compatible with the Iphone 5's hardware. The cheap screen had also damaged the phone's internal circuits, resulting in the error codes and failures. The engineer advised me to replace the phone's motherboard, which would fix the issue.

I was relieved to finally figure out what the problem was, but the repair was going to be costly. But, in the end, I decided to go ahead with the motherboard replacement because I didn't want to lose all my data on the phone. 

## Happy Ending

Once the motherboard was replaced, the phone started working correctly, and there were no more error messages or weird behavior. It was like having a brand new phone. 

The experience taught me a valuable lesson – always use genuine Iphone parts when repairing your Iphone. The quality of the parts used can have a significant impact on the phone's performance and longevity.

So, if you have an Iphone that needs repair, make sure you invest in genuine parts and don't fall into the trap of using cheap replacements. It will save you time, money, and frustration in the long run.

## Chosen Solution
 So I changed the screen. Prior to this the phone was working. Now at startup, the logo is shown as usual for a few seconds. Then the logo turns grey and I get codes from the top of the screen. Nothing happens after this. What should I do?

 Hello disconnect the frint camera cable and turn on again see does that fix it..
Usually a faulty camera flex causes this fault

 There is three cables connecting the screen to the motherboard. Try disconnecting them, then reconnect them. Did this work?
