# Is Your Acer Aspire One Pav70 Dead? Find Out the Shocking Reason Why it Won't Turn On!

If you're an owner of an Acer Aspire One Pav70 and it won't turn on, you're not alone. Many users have reported facing this frustrating issue at some point in time. But don't give up on your trusty laptop just yet. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the possible reasons why your Acer Aspire One Pav70 won't turn on and what you can do to fix it.

## Is the Battery Dead?

One of the most common reasons why your Acer Aspire One Pav70 won't turn on is because the battery is dead. The solution is quite simple. Plug your laptop into a power source and wait for it to charge. Once the battery has enough charge, you should be able to turn on your laptop.

However, if your laptop won't charge or hold a charge, you may need to replace the battery. You can do this by getting a new battery from the manufacturer or a reliable third-party seller.

## Is the AC Adapter Faulty?

Another reason why your Acer Aspire One Pav70 won't turn on is because the AC adapter is faulty. This may happen due to a power surge or a defect in the adapter.

To check if this is the case, try plugging in another device, such as a phone or a tablet, into the same outlet using the same adapter. If that device charges, then your adapter is not faulty. But if it doesn't charge, you may need to replace the adapter.

## Is the Power Button Broken?

If your Acer Aspire One Pav70 won't turn on even when the battery is charged and the AC adapter is working, it's possible that the power button is broken.

Try pressing the power button a few times to see if it responds. If not, you may need to take your laptop to a repair shop to get the power button fixed.

## Is the Motherboard Damaged?

Sometimes, the reason why your Acer Aspire One Pav70 won't turn on is because the motherboard is damaged. This usually happens due to power surges, overheating, or physical damage.

If you suspect that your motherboard is damaged, you'll need to take your laptop to a professional technician to diagnose the problem and fix it.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are several reasons why your Acer Aspire One Pav70 won't turn on. However, most of these reasons have a simple solution. Just make sure to check your battery, AC adapter, and power button before jumping to conclusions.

And if none of these solutions work, don't hesitate to take your laptop to a repair shop. With the right expertise, you can get your Acer Aspire One Pav70 back to its former glory.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Acer Aspire One PAV70 that does not turn on.  The blue power light will turn on for maybe 4 seconds and any usb devices will power up but the screen does not turn on.  I have tried removing the battery, resetting the CMOS and testing it with another stick of RAM that I believe to be good.

 Try to drop out the hdd drive and to boot it then, i've seen on the net that faulty drives might prevent them from booting properly, also u can try to run it barebones on the table to make sure ur case isnt shorting out

 I have the same system, same problem, did the following:
Take out HDD, turn it on.
Take off the Ram, turn it on. (Of course, nothing happens)
Tried a static discharge (Pressing the power button for around 15sec with de PC unplugged)
When i placed the ram and HDD back on it worked just fine.
Maybe it was a ram issue, maybe it resetted the mboard. I really dont know what was THE issue but this worked somehow.
