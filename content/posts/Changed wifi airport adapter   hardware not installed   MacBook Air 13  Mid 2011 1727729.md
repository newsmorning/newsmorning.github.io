## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
My macbook was working fine until i dropped water at him.
I dried all computer and turned on. Everything were working well, except the wifi that are showing the message: "No hardware Installed."
I tought weird, because bluetooth was still working, but wifi doesn't.
Even that, i bought an airport adapter and installed. But the message still there: "No hardware installed".
What could be the problem? What can i do to solve that?
Best regards!

 If you got a new Airport card and still are having issues, the connector on the motherboard may have been damaged.  I would check the 'About the Mac' window and look at the system report to see if the system detects an airport card. If not, you could try an OS X restore.  Otherwise, this issue is hard to fix...
