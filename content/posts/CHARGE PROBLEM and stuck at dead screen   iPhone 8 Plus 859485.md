## Chosen Solution
 my phone wont charge i;ve gotten mutiply new batterys and charging ports and it says its charging but wont go up ive tried to restore already nothing will work plx help
it died then went to the plug in dead screen I plugged it in then it goes black

 It could be a bad tristar ic. It's what controls the charging and data transfer. It can be damaged by using an aftermarket charging cable that was not MFI Certified and cause voltage spikes. I would take it to a repair shop and have them test the tristar ic. It only takes a minute and they will probably do it for free.
