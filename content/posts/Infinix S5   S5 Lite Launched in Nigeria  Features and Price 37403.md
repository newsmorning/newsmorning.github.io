The Nigerian smartphone market has witnessed tremendous growth in recent years, thanks to the influx of affordable and feature-rich devices from various manufacturers. However, there is one brand that stands out from the rest- Infinix Mobility. This Hong Kong-based smartphone manufacturer has established itself as one of the most popular brands in Nigeria, offering powerful and affordable devices that cater to the masses.

Infinix Mobility has unleashed its latest game-changers- Infinix S5 and S5 Lite, which have taken the Nigerian smartphone market by storm. These devices come packed with unbelievable features and are priced to sell like hotcakes.

Let's take a look at what makes these devices stand out from the competition.

Design and Display

The Infinix S5 and S5 Lite come with a tall and narrow 6.6-inch IPS LCD display with HD+ resolution. The aspect ratio of the screen is 20:9, which is perfect for watching videos and playing games. The device is available in Quetzal Cyan, Midnight Black, and Violet colors. The back has a new pattern design, which is pleasing to the eye.

Camera

The camera is the most significant selling point of the Infinix S5 and S5 Lite. Both devices come with a quad-camera setup at the back. The primary camera is a 16MP sensor, accompanied by a 5MP wide-angle lens, a 2MP depth sensor, and a dedicated low light sensor. The front camera on the Infinix S5 is a whopping 32MP sensor, while the S5 Lite features an 8MP sensor. Both these cameras come with AI-based features that can enhance your images' quality.

Performance and Battery

Under the hood, both devices pack the octa-core MediaTek Helio P22 chipset and run on Android 9.0 Pie-based XOS 5.5. The Infinix S5 comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, whereas the S5 Lite comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, which is expandable via microSD cards. Both devices can handle day-to-day tasks with ease, thanks to their software optimization.

The battery on the Infinix S5 is a massive 4,000mAh which can quickly charge via the 10W fast charging adapter. The Infinix S5 Lite, on the other hand, comes with a 4,000mAh battery without fast charging support.

Pricing and Availability

Both devices are priced very competitively. The Infinix S5 costs N83,500, while the S5 Lite costs N45,000. They are available in stores across Nigeria and can also be purchased online.

Conclusion

The Infinix S5 and S5 Lite are excellent devices that pack outstanding features at an affordable price. With their quad-camera setup, powerful battery, and performance, these devices can take on any competition in the market. If you are looking for a budget-friendly phone packed with features, the Infinix S5 and S5 Lite are undoubtedly worth considering.


Just about 7 months after released the highly-revered Infinix S4 (the first device from the OEM to have a waterdrop-shaped display notch and triple rear-camera setup), Infinix Mobility is here with a new flagship for the Hot S series.
 
Dubbed the Infinix S5, the device comes with improvements in aesthetics, camera, and storage. Price-wise, the device is also a bargain. It also comes on four different variants to give users a variety to choose from — depending on their budget. Basically, there’s a Hot S5 for every price-class out there.
 
Let’s check out the features of the device.
 
## Infinix S5: Design
 
In terms of body build and size, the Infinix S5 is just a little bigger and heavier (178 g) than its predecessor. And this is because it comes with a bigger screen and more components like an extra camera, etc.
 
On the rear, the fingerprint sensor is close to the top of the device and the quad-cameras are aligned vertically at the top-left corner of the device. The quad-LED flash lighting set-up can be found close to the rear camera arrangement too. Taking a closer look at the rear of the device, you’d notice some patterns on it.
 
These patterns, according to Infinix, were inspired by a bird (called the Quetzal bird) and helps give the device it’s gradient-like appearance. The three color variants (Nebula Black, Quetzal Cyan, and Violet) of the Infinix S5 are also inspired by the device.
 
The design of the Infinix S5 is impressive, an improvement from the predecessor. One thing that remained the same, however, is the presence of a Micro-USB port at the bottom of the device. It’s 2019, Infinix, USB-C is the in-thing now. Aside that, everything else looks and feels good. Then the display…
 
## Display
 
The Infinix S5 sports what the OEM calls the “Infinity-O display”, a similar bezel-less display concept pioneered by Samsung. At the top-right corner of the 6.6-inch LCD display, you’d find a tiny punch-hole cut-out that houses the device’s front-facing camera. This makes the Infinix S5 the first smartphone from the brand to sport a punch-hole cut-out. Impressive, I must say.
 
The punch hole gives the device’s display more room and helps reduce the bezel. The screen comes boasts of an HD+ (720 x 1600 pixels) resolution, a display density of 270 ppi, and a 90.5% screen-to-body ratio. You’d surely enjoy a cinematic experience while watching movies or playing HD games on the device.
 
## Software and Processor
 
This is where the Infinix S5 disappoints. The device comes with the exact software and processor configurations as its predecessor, the Infinix S4. Software-wise, it is based on the Android 9.0 Pie operating system. There’s no word from Infinix on the possibility of an Android 10 update in the future but we expect it to.
 
Underneath the super appealing aesthetic of the device, a Mediatek MT6762 Helio P22 chipset that sports an Octa-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU powers the operation of the Infinix S5 while a PowerVR GE8320 GPU handles graphics. This is the same chipset, CPU, and GPU that powers the Infinix S4.
 
## Camera
 
Asides from packing a total of four cameras (a first from Infinix), the S5 boasts of impressive features camera-focused features like upgraded Facial Recognition technology, accurate facial sharpness, accurate backlit portraits, improved 3D face beauty function, AR stickers, face beauty in video calls (only available in WhatsApp), etc.
 
For the Infinix S5, the four cameras on the rear are configured accordingly: a primary 16MP lens, a secondary 5MP ultra-wide-angle/macro lens, a tertiary 2MP depth field lens, and lastly, the AI lens.
 
The Quad-LED smart flashlight is also positioned close to the quad-camera setup for improved lighting in low-light environments.
 
On the front, the selfie camera is a 32MP sensor that features improved AI technology, enhanced low-light and backlighting, and true-to-life capturing.
 
### For the Infinix S5 Lite
 
The camera configuration of the Infinix S5 Lite is a little different. It comes with three cameras on the rear, one less than the regular S5.
 
The S5 Lite sports a 16MP primary lens, a secondary 2MP depth field camera, and a tertiary AI lens. It lacks an ultrawide-angle/macro lens. The front-facing camera is also pegged at 16-megapixels and, like the S5, it also supports 3D AI Beauty and Face beauty video-calling (currently available in WhatsApp only)
 
## Storage
 
There’s a lot of improvement in this section. First off, the Infinix S5 comes with a dedicated SD card that lets users boost their storage up to 256GB, an improvement from the S4’s 128GB.
 
Per RAM and built-in storage combination, the Infinix S5 is available in two different variants: a 6GB RAM + 128GB ROM and a toned-down 4GB RAM + 64GB ROM variant.
 
### Infinix S5 Lite
 
The Infinix S5 Lite is also available in two storage variants: a 4GB RAM + 64GB ROM variant and a smaller 3GB RAM + 32G ROM version for people on a smaller budget.
 
## Battery
 
Both the S5 and S5 Lite ship with a 4,000 mAh Lithium-Polymer battery and can be charged via the Micro USB port at the bottom of the device. Infinix says the battery is capable of a 50 Hours Talktime and 32 Days of standby.
 
## Price and Availability
 
Both the S5 and S5 Lite have been launched and are available on pre-order only. For NGN 5,000, you can pre-order the S5 and S5 Lite at any accredited Infinix retail store on or before November 12. Pre-ordering the device also comes with a free HD Bluetooth headset as a gift.
 
The regular retail price of the devices, however, are as follows;

All variants of the device will officially begin to ship/retail by November 19th. For the features that the devices pack, they are worth what they sell for.
 
What do you think? Would you be disposing of your S4 to get the S5? Or the S5 Lite?
