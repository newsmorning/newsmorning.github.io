Title: Is Your Acer S231Hl Monitor Dead? Find Out How to Revive it and Say Goodbye to Flicker Issues!

Introduction:

The Acer S231Hl Monitor is a reliable and efficient monitor that has won the trust and loyalty of many users. However, a monitor can develop flicker problems, which can be frustrating and may signify that the monitor is dead. In this article, we will show you how to revive your Acer S231HL monitor and get rid of flicker issues.

Body:

Step One: Check the Power Supply

When your Acer S231HL monitor is flickering or not turning on, the first thing you should check is the power supply. Ensure that the power cable is securely connected to the power source and the monitor's power port. Also, check if the adapter is working correctly. If there is a problem, consider getting a new adapter.

Step Two: Check the Video Cable

Sometimes, the flicker issue may be caused by a loose or faulty video cable. Check if the cable is correctly connected to both the monitor and the computer. If necessary, try a different cable or connect the monitor to a different computer to confirm if the monitor is the problem.

Step Three: Adjust the Display Settings

If none of the above steps solves the flicker issue, consider adjusting the display settings on your computer. Right-click on your desktop and select 'Display settings.' From there, try adjusting the refresh rate, resolution, or color quality to see if any of these settings resolve the issue.

Step Four: Update Your Graphics Driver

Outdated graphics drivers can cause flicker issues on your monitor. To update your graphics driver, go to the manufacturer's website, download the latest driver, and install it on your computer.

Step Five: Reset Your Monitor

If your Acer S231Hl monitor is still flickering, you should try resetting it. To do this, turn off the monitor and unplug it from its power source. Next, press and hold the power button for about 30 seconds before plugging it back in and turning it on.

Conclusion:

Flickering issues on your Acer S231Hl monitor can be frustrating and annoying. However, before concluding that your monitor is dead, follow the steps outlined in this article. Often, it is a minor issue that you can solve with minimal effort. If none of these steps work, consult an expert or consider getting a new monitor.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an Acer S231HL monitor. It was having a problem where it would turn on and work after flickering on and off for a while, but after turning off due to standby or powering it off, it wouldn’t come back on unless I’d unplug the HDMI cable for a while.

I opened it to look for any blown capacitors, and during a test power run, I’m pretty sure I accidentally bridged connections on the boards by not elevating them from the back (the screen was face down with the boards sitting on its metal backing plate), because when I turned it on the power light was flickering. I stupidly lifted the inverter board off the back metal plate of the monitor while this was happening instead of turning it off first, and now the monitor doesn’t turn on at all. No power light or anything. I’m guessing I shorted something on the inverter board when I lifted it, and from what I’ve read, replacing the inverter was the solution to the initial issue as well.
Here's how everything is situated when the monitor is fully assembled (the button board in the top-left there sits in the bezel normally):

Here's how the boards sit in their caddies, which i assume are supposed to put space between the boards and backplate of the LCD, as well as act as grounds:


Here's how everything was situated for the test run, except obviously the screws weren't there and everything was plugged into each other properly:

Mainboard:

Inverter board:

Backs of both of those boards:

Does anyone know if I need to replace the inverter board, main board, or both?

 I don't know if anyone is still checking this but I had this same monitor. I also was having screen flickering issues were it would go black and the Acer logo would flash in a loop.Unplugging and replugging gave temporary relief but ultimately the issue came back.When checking the power brick I found that it was very hot...not hot enough to warp it or anything but it was hot!I replaced the power brick with a laptop power brick and cord and it the flickering error went away. Hopefully this helps. Try replacing the power supply first.

 @adinga  hard to say without seeing it. Since you get absolutely nothing from this monitor I would suggest that you start checking the power board first. Your description and your monitors symptoms sound like a bad power board. Post some GOOD pictures of your boards with your Question so that we can see what you see.
