# Apple Users Beware: Screen Replacement for iPhone 6S Causes Home Button Nightmare!

If you own an iPhone 6S, you will understand the value of its home button. This button is the key to unlocking your phone, taking you back to your home screen, and launching Siri. But what happens when you replace your screen, and your home button is no longer working? This is the nightmare iPhone users have been experiencing lately.

The iPhone 6S was launched in 2015, and it has a very distinct home button that uses a Touch ID sensor. This feature was incredibly innovative during its time and made life much easier for iPhone users. However, as time has gone on, more and more iPhones have been suffering from problems relating to the home button, including not responding to button presses, and failing to recognize fingerprints.

The problem seems to stem from replacing the original screen with a third-party one. Apple has always advised against using third-party screens, warning that they may not be of the same quality as the original. But many users still opt for cheaper third-party screens, which, apart from the lower quality, appear to cause issues with the home button.

The problem is so widespread that Apple has even issued a statement that reads, "Important note on iPhone and iPad display replacement: If you replace your iPhone or iPad display with a third-party display, some third-party displays may cause the touch ID sensor to become unresponsive." This tells us that Apple has acknowledged the problem and is advising users against replacing their screens with third-party ones.

If your home button has stopped working altogether, you will need to replace it. Apple recommends taking your phone to an authorized Apple technician for repair, as this will ensure that the repair is carried out by an expert who knows the ins and outs of the phone.

It is essential to be cautious when replacing your iPhone screen. Cheap third-party screens may save you money, but they are not worth it in the long run. If your home button is not responding, take your phone to an Apple authorized repair center and have them take a look at it. This will save you time, money, and a whole load of trouble.

In conclusion, if you're an iPhone 6S user who is thinking about replacing your screen, be very careful. The home button's Touch ID sensor is highly sensitive, and third-party screens may cause the sensor to become unresponsive. Take your phone to an authorized Apple technician for repair, and don't be tempted by cheap third-party screens. Remember, your iPhone is an expensive and essential device that needs to be taken care of. By doing so, you'll be able to enjoy your phone for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, so I know this is a commonly asked question, but I can’t find anything like my situation. I got a replacement 6s screen a while ago, installed it fine, didn’t rip any cables or anything, the only thing I noticed was that the home button was really loose and would shift around a lot. I reconnected everything correctly, but I didn’t snap in the clips holding the screen down because I wanted to make sure it worked. The LCD issues were fixed, but the home button was very finicky and would only work about half the time or when I held it down for a few seconds. After trying it for a while it just stopped responding at all. I disconnected the battery, digitizer cables, etc. to make sure everything was good, and it seemed totally normal. Now I don’t know what to do. Please help me out, thanks. I never had Touch ID enabled so I don’t know if that works.

 Might be a home button gasket loose, or the home button cable might be loose, you can buy a gasket here: iPhone 6s and 6s Plus Home Button Gasket Without replacing the gasket, the home button will feel loose and that might have ripped the cable. Open it up and check the cable, if it is the gasket, you can replace it easily.

 To clarify is the screen right now not turning on? If yes try shining a flashlight to the screen to see if there is a dim apple logo appearing when you reseat the battery connector and then the phone on.
Note that if the screen connectors were touched while the battery was still plugged in this can cause the backlight circuit to blow.
If that is the case the phone will need to be taken to a local reputable phone repair shop that does board repairs to fix the backlight circuit.
