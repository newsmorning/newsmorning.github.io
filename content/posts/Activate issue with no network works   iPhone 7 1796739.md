# You Won't Believe It: How to Fix Your iPhone 7's Network Issue WITHOUT Any Internet Connection? Click Here to Find Out!

If you're an iPhone 7 user, network issues might be a common frustration for you. Whether it's slow data speed, a weak signal, or no connection at all, these problems can seriously hinder your experience with your device. On top of that, fixes for network issues often require an internet connection. But what if we told you that there's a way to fix your iPhone 7's network issue without any internet connection? Here's how.

## Step 1: Reset Your Network Settings

The first step in fixing any network issue on your iPhone 7 is to reset your network settings. This will erase all of your current Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth connections, but it can often fix issues caused by a misconfiguration of your settings.

To reset your network settings, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. Enter your passcode, and confirm that you want to reset your network settings. Your iPhone 7 will restart and your network settings will be restored to their default values.

## Step 2: Turn Airplane Mode On and Off

If resetting your network settings didn't fix your network issue, try turning Airplane Mode on and off. This can often help if your iPhone 7 is having trouble connecting to a specific network, or if you're experiencing slow data speeds.

To turn Airplane Mode on and off, go to Settings > Airplane Mode. Tap the switch to turn Airplane Mode on, wait a few seconds, and then tap the switch again to turn it off.

## Step 3: Perform a Hard Reset

If resetting your network settings and turning Airplane Mode on and off didn't fix your network issue, try performing a hard reset. This will force your iPhone 7 to restart, which can often clear up any software-related issues.

To perform a hard reset on your iPhone 7, hold down the Power button and the Volume Down button until the Apple logo appears on the screen. Once your iPhone 7 restarts, see if your network issue has been resolved.

## Conclusion

Dealing with network issues on your iPhone 7 can be frustrating, but there are ways to fix the problem without an internet connection. By resetting your network settings, turning Airplane Mode on and off, and performing a hard reset, you can often clear up any issues with your device's network connectivity. Give these steps a try the next time you're experiencing network issues on your iPhone 7.

 I solved that issues by changing BBPMU IC on iPhone 7 and restore via iTunes then my problem solved.This videos help me to find the solution.Hope this works.

 This is a known issue with the iPhone 7 modem. Send in for repair with Apple: https://www.apple.com/support/iphone-7-n....

 I had this issue with iPhone 7.
Did a chat with apple representative and they had me go to my iTunes and make sure I was updated first. Then turn phone off and connect to computer. Then open iTunes and let it install update.
It didn’t work.
She next had hold down the power and volume up button for about a minute or two until your phone shows that it is connected to iTunes, then the iTunes screen on my laptop was showing that it was extracting, then when it was done it started to update.
Phone turned off after installing and I was able to set my phone up.

 some people with this case get their phone back with changing baseband power ic on the machine board. May be y’all wanna try it too.

 if the model is of those : A1660, 1680 , A1779  then there is no issue coz apple said it, you can read this link :https://support.apple.com/iphone-7-no-se...

 Fixed by adding another device to my account(iphone 6) then i removed my iphone 7 from list of trusted phones. That allowed me to activate.
