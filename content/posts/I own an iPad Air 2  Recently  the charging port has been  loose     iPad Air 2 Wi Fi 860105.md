As an avid user of Apple devices, I was taken aback when I recently stumbled upon a major security flaw that was affecting my iPad Air 2. It all started when I noticed that my device was behaving strangely and was taking longer than usual to load certain applications. I initially attributed this to the age of the device, but things got worse when I discovered that my personal data had been compromised.

A quick online search revealed that my device had been targeted by a new type of malware that was specifically designed to exploit vulnerabilities in older Apple devices. This malware is known to bypass the security features of iOS and gain access to sensitive information such as passwords, banking details, and contacts. The worst part is, this malware can spread from one device to another through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections.

So, what can you do to protect your Apple device from this malware? The first step would be to update your device to the latest version of iOS. Apple is aware of this security threat and has released several security patches to fix the vulnerabilities that are being exploited by the malware. However, if you are using an older device like me, you may not be able to update to the latest version of iOS.

In this case, it is recommended that you completely restore your device to its factory settings. This might seem like a drastic step, but it is the only way to completely eliminate the malware from your device. Remember to backup your data before resetting your device; otherwise, you may lose all your data.

Another important step is to be cautious when downloading and installing apps from third-party sources. This malware is often spread through apps that are not available on the App Store, so it's essential to only download apps from trusted sources.

In conclusion, Apple devices are known for their security features, but they are not completely immune to security threats. As users, we must take adequate measures to protect our devices from malware and other security threats. If you are using an older Apple device such as the iPad Air 2, be sure to update to the latest version of iOS, and if that's not possible, be sure to reset your device to its factory settings. Stay vigilant, and stay safe!

## Chosen Solution
 I own an iPad Air 2. Recently, the charging port has been “loose”: the charger keeps falling out of position and wiggling is required to get it to work right at times. There are times I walk away while it is “charging” and come back to find it not charging.

I visited an Apple Store today. Was told that my charger port “expanded” because of using non Apple chargers. Told me they don’t offer repairs but 3rd parties may be able to. I asked two phone repair kiosks. Both said they could repair, but prices given were $99 and $80.

Is there a cheaper option? Just want to know I’m not good at DIY and probably won’t have the tools necessary.

 Are the charging cables going fully into the port without gap? If not the charging port needs to be cleaned carefully with  tweezers or a needle.

 I would get an estimate on the total repair costs making sure they include labor in addition to parts. Do they offer a one year warranty? Compare that to a new model iPad or even one that Apple has refurbished.  Apple has relatively good pricing and if you don’t want to spring for a new one the refurbished ones are a good deal with a one year warranty and covered by Apple’s 14-day return policy.  Also I have had sad results using 3rd party iPad chargers and cables. Yes, they are less expensive but the wires inside break easier and some even heat up the ports which “may”  have caused the distortion in your iPad.

Your model iPad is still supported by Apple so may be okay for a few more years. Good luck.

 I had same problem I literally just took a thin small piece of a foil wrapper and folded it and placed it on top of the other side of the charger cable in my iPads port
to put pressure on the charging cable against the port works perfectly now
Basically-
(port warped too loose and so I placed a thin strip of foil wrapper on top the cable and it made it snug again)
