Have you ever noticed a blinking code, "1 7", on your refrigerator display and wondered what it means? Many refrigerators use this flashing code to indicate a problem with the appliance. The flashing code 1 7 is a warning sign that indicates that the refrigerator is not cooling properly, and it needs maintenance before food spoilage occurs.

In this article, we will discuss the causes of the flashing code 1 7, how to identify the problem, and what you can do to solve it.

**What Causes the Flashing Code 1 7?**

The flashing code 1 7 is a warning sign that your refrigerator is not cooling properly. There can be several reasons for this malfunction, such as:

- Dirty or clogged condenser coils
- Faulty defrost thermostat
- Malfunctioning evaporator fan motor
- Broken compressor relay
- Malfunctioning temperature control thermostat

If you notice any of these issues, it can lead to food spoilage, and you should schedule a repair service immediately. Ignoring the flashing code 1 7 can result in costly repairs, food wastage, and even health problems.

**How to Identify the Problem?**

If you see the flashing code 1 7 on your refrigerator display, the first sign of identifying the issue is to check the temperature inside the appliance. If the temperature is above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, then it's clear that the refrigerator is not cooling adequately.

To check the evaporator fan motor, open the freezer compartment and check if you can hear the fan running. If you cannot hear the fan, then it's likely faulty and requires replacement.

You can also check the condenser coils behind or beneath the refrigerator. If they're dirty or clogged with dust, it can cause the refrigerator to work too hard and malfunction.

**What to Do if Your Refrigerator is Flashing Code 1 7?**

If your refrigerator is flashing code 1 7, then you must take the following steps:

1. Unplug your refrigerator and wait for at least 10 minutes before plugging it back in. This may reset the control board, and the flashing code may disappear.

2. Check the temperature inside the refrigerator to ensure it's not above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

3. Check the freezer and refrigerator doors to ensure they are not open. Sometimes, a flashing code may appear due to an open door.

4. Check the condenser coils behind or beneath the refrigerator and clean them thoroughly to remove any dirt or dust.

If none of the above works, then it's time to call a professional repair service.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the flashing code 1 7 on your refrigerator is a warning sign that your appliance needs maintenance. It's essential to identify the problems that can cause the flashing code and take immediate steps to prevent food spoilage. Regular maintenance and cleaning of the refrigerator can help avoid such issues and keep your fridge working efficiently for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I actually have a LG refrigerator with the freezer on the bottom. The display panel inside the fridge is not digital. The panel reads 1-7, warm to coldest. There are 2 adjust buttons on each side and an ice plus button in the center. When it is working properly, the number it is set to will light up green. Right now each number lights up green and moves on to the next number, over and over again and it is not cooling. I've called LG and they don't seem to have current info on this model, it is outdated apparently. Does anyone have any advice that I could try?

 Hi @scate5 ,
Disconnect the power to the refrigerator for ~5 minutes and then reconnect it.
After it starts (or tries to) check what is being displayed on the freezer temp settings side of the display panel.
Normally it should display a 4 for both the refrigerator temp and freezer temp settings if everything is OK at startup.
Hopefully the lights will remain steady and give you an error code.
Here’s the  service manual for the refrigerator. Go to p.27 to view the error codes and what their causes may be. Remember to only look at the freezer temp lights as according to the manual the refrigerator temp lights should be off if there is an error detected.
If no good try to get into Test Mode, as described on p.28 and see if you can run the diagnostics to find out what’s wrong.
If the refrigerator controls locks up or it doesn’t respond etc, simply disconnect the power to the refrigerator for a few minutes and then plug it in again.
