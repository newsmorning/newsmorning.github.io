The combination of powerful subwoofer and two satellite speakers delivers crystal clear sound with deep bass that truly immerses you in the experience. The bass is especially impressive, providing a rich, full sound that is often lacking in other PC speakers.

Finding a perfect blend between useful features, size, and audio quality is tough for computer speakers, given all the varied tasks they’re used for. The Logitech Z337 speakers aim to find that balance while also working under a very low price tag. They may not have the absolute best sound quality for their price, but they have several advantages over their competition, and they’re good-looking.

 
##   Design and Accessories: Tiny monsters with lots of character  
 

There are few desks that are too small to accommodate the Logitech Z337 speakers. The two satellite speakers are 4.3 inches wide and 3.5 inches deep, about the size of a coaster, and stand short at 7.6 inches. The subwoofer is a little larger, its longest side measuring 9.1 inches, but it’s still small enough to not interfere with legroom.

 

They have a beautiful finish to them, a dark grey sandstone texture, and cloth-covered drivers that will accentuate your decor. Underneath the veneer, the speaker bodies are made of plastic, which isn’t the best material for audio transmission, but at this price point, other materials are hard to come by.

 

The subwoofer is the heart of this set, since it’s the component that connects to power and to the other speakers. All the cables are 5-7 inches in length, although they’re easy to kink and quite flimsy. Unfortunately, the power cable and the control pod cable are permanently attached to the subwoofer, so if they break, repairing the system is much more complicated than just swapping out the bad cable for a new one.

 

If the subwoofer is the heart, the control pod is the brain. This 2-inch puck controls main volume, power on/off, and Bluetooth. The volume knob is big and chunky, very pleasant to use. The control pod also has a headphone input for 3.5mm auxiliary connectors.

 

The speakers’ line inputs are located on the subwoofer: RCA and 3.5mm auxiliary. While the kit comes with an included 3.5mm cable, it’s disappointing Logitech didn’t provide an RCA cable, as well. 

 
##   Setup Process: They’re beginner-friendly, but you’re on your own  
 

Setting up the Z337 speakers is easy enough, but there is little in the box to help you get started. The packaging itself has a couple of wordless diagrams, and that’s it. I’ll try to walk you through the setup process, but in case you’re more of a visual learner, Logitech has a more detailed setup guide on their website.

 

Before you start connecting your speakers, you should position them properly for the best sound. You want the satellite speakers to form a triangle with your head, each speaker pointing toward your ears. They should be about as far away from each other as they are from you. The subwoofer should be on the floor, out of the way so you don’t kick it.

 

The wires to connect the speakers to the subwoofer are color-coded, so connect the speakers to the corresponding port. Connect the subwoofer to power. To connect the system to your PC, you have two options: 3.5mm or RCA. 

 

You can adjust the subwoofer (bass) volume with the knob on the rear of the subwoofer, but I recommend keeping it at midlevel and adjusting its volume with EQ software to minimize bass distortion. 

 

The on/off switch is on the control pod. Finally, if you want to use Bluetooth, press the Bluetooth button on the control pod and connect to “Logitech Z337” on your other device. 

 
##   Sound Quality: An upgrade for the casual listener  
 

The Logitech Z337 is no audiophile speakers, but they’re not bad. Music is pleasant to listen to, and dialogue in movies is crisp and clear. Their lack of spatial depth makes them a poor choice for reflex-based games, but they’re still leagued better than your built-in PC speakers. 

 

Highs on these speakers are clear and sparkly. The treble has no problem cutting through the rest of the audio, and while it’s not shrill, I found it fatiguing after prolonged use. The bass is pleasantly clear thanks to the subwoofer. If you like a thundering bassline, I recommend keeping the subwoofer’s physical volume at or below 50 percent and EQing the bass volume in software, since the subwoofer distorts at higher volumes. As for the satellites, they also distort at higher volumes, although their max volume is louder than most desk users would ever desire. 

 

The mids are these speakers’ weak point, as the 3-inch drivers present a muddy and loose sound. They’re undoubtedly clearer than your integrated PC or monitor speakers, but they notably lack the precision and refinement you can find in bookshelf speakers of the same price. For casual listening, the Z337 speakers are fine, but if you need something more serious, such as for video editing or competitive gaming, you should look elsewhere.

 
Music is pleasant to listen to, and dialogue in movies is crisp and clear. 
 
##   Price: Well priced for its balance of performance and features  
 
##   Competition: The Z337s are jack-of-all-trades, master of none  
 

The way these speakers are built, one part fails and the whole system fails with it. The Z337s also lack remarkable audio quality or features for their price, so the competition against it is stiff.

 
For about $80, these speakers are a good basic set that will get the job done.
 

 

 
Solid speakers for general computer use, but lacking higher-end sound quality.
