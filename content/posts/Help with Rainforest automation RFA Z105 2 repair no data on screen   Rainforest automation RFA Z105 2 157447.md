# 5 Quick Fixes for Your Rainforest Automation Rfa Z105 2 - Turn Your Blank Screen to Brilliant!

The Rainforest Automation Rfa Z105 2 is a great device for monitoring your home's energy usage. However, like any technology, it can have occasional issues. One of the most common problems that users encounter is a blank screen. Here are 5 quick fixes to help you turn your blank screen to brilliant!

## 1. Check the Power Supply

The first thing you need to do is check the power supply. Sometimes, the device may not be getting enough power, causing the screen to go blank. Make sure the device is plugged in and the cable is securely attached. You may also want to try a different power outlet if the current one is not functioning properly.

## 2. Restart the Device

If the power supply appears to be working properly, try restarting the device. Sometimes, these types of devices can experience software issues that can be resolved by restarting. Unplug the device from the power source and wait a few minutes before plugging it back in. Upon restarting the device, the software should reset, and the screen should come back on.

## 3. Update the Firmware

Updating firmware is another possible solution if your device’s screen is blank. Navigate to the Rainforest Automation website and download the latest firmware for your particular device model. Follow the instructions provided to update the firmware of the device. Make sure the device is not disconnected during the update process as this can cause serious damage.

## 4. Check Network Connection

Your device’s screen may also be blank because it’s losing or has lost the network signal. Check that the device has a stable network signal by looking at the signal bars on the device's screen. If the signal is not working, you may need to restart your router or modem or contact your internet service provider to help to troubleshoot network issues.

## 5. Reset the Device to Factory Settings

If all of the above quick fixes have not resolved the blank screen problem, the last option is to try resetting the device to its factory settings. To do this, press and hold the reset button (usually located at the back of the device) for a few seconds. You should see the lights on the device flicker, indicating that the device has been reset. Note that resetting the device will erase all stored data and settings, so be sure to back up any important data before resetting.

Conclusion

The Rainforest Automation Rfa Z105 2 is a great device that helps monitor your home's energy usage, but screen blanking can be quite frustrating. Luckily, the fixes discussed above should help you resolve this issue quickly. With this, you can continue to monitor your house's energy consumption and save more money on electricity bills.


## Chosen Solution
 Need to repair a Rainforest EM-2.  Screen shows no data
Thanks...Bill

 Sounds like no power to the unit. There is an AC adapter (wall wart), but also batteries for back up power inside.
Make sure the AC adapter has power, and is plugged into the unit.
Replace the internal batteries.

Ok, didn't know it had backlight etc.
Since the indicator lights are functioning, the processor is probably working and LCD isn't getting data or power. Some LCD's are socketed and have been known to creep out of their socket. These days that's a long shot tho.
In this case you will have to call the manufacturer. It may be a pattern failure with this model. They will know that, although they may not admit it without a little social engineering haha.
Good luck.
