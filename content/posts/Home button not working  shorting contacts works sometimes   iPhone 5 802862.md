As iPhone users, we all know how important the home button is. It is used to go back to the home screen, switch apps, and even access Siri. However, after years of use, the home button may stop working properly. If you've experienced this issue, you're not alone. Many iPhone users have been facing this dilemma and are not aware of how to solve it. But, fret not because there's a solution that may surprise you.

A secret hack has been discovered that can solve your home button dilemma. The trick is to use the "AssistiveTouch" feature that is already built into your iPhone. It is a feature that is designed for people with disabilities to use their device without the need for a physical button.

To activate the feature, simply go to "Settings," then "General," and "Accessibility." From there, scroll down until you find "AssistiveTouch" and turn it on. You'll see a small, round button appear on your screen that resembles the home button. You can now use this button to go back to your home screen, switch apps, or even activate Siri. 

But the hack doesn't stop there. You can customize the AssistiveTouch button to perform multiple functions. To do so, go to the "Customize Top Level Menu" option that you'll find under AssistiveTouch. Here, you can add additional features that you use frequently on your iPhone, such as taking screenshots or adjusting volume.

This hidden gem of a hack has left many iPhone users astounded. The feature is already built into your device, and it is accessible with just a few taps. It's a lifesaver for those who have been struggling with their home button and don't want to spend money on costly repairs or replacements.

It is a feature that is already built into your device, and activating it is quite easy. The best part is that you can customize the feature to suit your needs.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently replaced both the battery and the lighting connector assembly. Everything works fine except for the home button. I am still using the OEM home button assembly and the contacts are still correctly attached to the back of the digitizer. It appears that they come into contact with the metal prongs on the lightning assembly but the home button doesn't activate. I then removed the screen and tried shorting the contacts but nothing resulted from it. However, and this is what confuses me, if I hooked a paper clip under one and pressed it against the other and jiggled it around a little the connection was made and a home button press was triggered. I then removed the home button from the display and touched the contacts agaianst the metal prongs and depressed the button, again nothing, I tried again this time pressing down on the conctacts, firmly, untill they were fully depressed. This time, the home button worked and reliably too. So my question is, what is faulty... and how do I fix it?

 I have had something similar happen and although the prongs work at times depending on what you do it's still a faulty charge port.  I had an iPhone 5 that did the same thing.  I could decompress the button and nothing.  I then tried another home button flex cable and nothing.  I shorted the two prongs and it would trigger sometimes 10 times in a row and then miss a few.  I replaced the charge port and never had the issue again.
