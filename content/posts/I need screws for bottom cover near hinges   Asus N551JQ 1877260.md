Title: Desperate for Screws – Asus N551Jq Bottom Cover Near Hinges About to Fall Off!

Introduction:
If you are the owner of an Asus N551Jq laptop, you might have encountered the issue of the bottom cover near hinges falling off. The reason behind this could be the loss of screws that hold the cover in place. Losing screws is a common problem that many laptop users face, and finding a replacement becomes a struggle, especially when you are in desperate need of them. However, fret not, as there are a few ways to handle this situation.

Body:
The screws that hold the bottom cover of Asus N551Jq laptops in place are easily removable, and it is common for this to happen, as over time, they tend to loosen up, and eventually fall off. This can cause the bottom cover near the hinges to become loose, and in the worst scenario, fall off. Losing screws can occur due to various reasons, such as misplacing them, getting damaged, or they might be worn out due to overuse.

If you have noticed the bottom cover near hinges getting loose, the first and foremost thing to do is to stop using the laptop until you find a solution. This is because the hinges of the laptop could be under a lot of pressure, which may cause them to snap, and thereby, damaging the laptop further.

Now, you may be wondering where to find these tiny screws that have gone missing. Finding replacement screws might become a daunting task, but with a little effort, you can find a solution to your problem. Here are a few ways that could help you get screws for your Asus laptop:

1. Contact Asus: The best way to obtain screws for your Asus laptop is to contact the official Asus customer support team. They can provide you with the product details and the screws’ specifications, and you can then order them online, or they might be able to send you the screws.

2. Visit Computer Repair Shops: If you are unable to contact Asus or are struggling to find a way to get the screws, then you can visit any computer repair shop near you. These shops may have spare screws, or they may be able to order them for you.

3. Online Shopping Platforms: There are several online shopping platforms such as Amazon, eBay, or Alibaba, where you could find screws for your Asus laptop. However, before purchasing, ensure that you check the specifications of the screws, and also the compatibility with your laptop.

Conclusion:
Losing screws is a common problem that most laptop users face, but finding a replacement can become a tedious process. If you are the owner of an Asus N551Jq laptop and are dealing with the issue of the bottom cover near hinges falling off, then you need not worry. You can contact the official Asus customer support team, visit computer repair shops, or opt for online shopping platforms to find screws for your laptop. Remember to be cautious when using the laptop with the loose cover as it may further damage it.


## Chosen Solution
 Got a Asus N551Jq trying desperately to find a screw that will secure bottom case to the front case hinges stay shut. (the two holes on bottom cover) requires I believe two long screws anyone know where I can purchase this? Or know screw type looking everywhere.

 Hi all,
just in case anyone needs it in the future.
Red: 2 screws (M2.5*10L) / connect bottom - hinge - topcase
Blue: 4 screws (M2*5L)
Purple: 2 screws (M2*3L)

Here you’ll need 2 longer screws (M2*16L)

These 6 screws (M2.5*4.5L) connect hinges to the bottom case

Basically, this list is applicable to both gaming (ROG G551 / GL551 / G58 series) and non-gaming (N551 series) models. Some minor differences may exist for TOUCH models.

 And a bit more detailed overview for the FX504GM:

 Hi,
Don't know if this is a help to you or not.
Here is a link that shows ''all'' the parts that are available for your laptop.
Scroll down and click on the screw link to get a list of the screws and their sizes,
e.g. M2.5*10L = metric screw 2.5mm wide x 10mm long

 Hi @Dante Xavier
Not the same detail as above but here are all the screws sizes available for the laptop model.
Just select the "Screw (14)" checkbox.
