Water damage is one of the most common problems iPhone users face. Whether it's a spilled drink or accidentally dropping your phone in water, water damage can cause the center button to become faulty or stop working entirely. But in a recent case, there was a surprising outcome that left the owner of the iPhone 3G in disbelief.

A few weeks ago, a customer brought in her iPhone 3G, which she had accidentally dropped in a puddle of water. Her phone had been experiencing some issues, and she suspected water damage was to blame. When our technicians inspected the device, they found that the center button was not functioning correctly.

The center button is a critical component of the iPhone, allowing users to navigate back to the home screen, activate Siri, and access the app switcher. Without this button, the user experience can be severely impacted.

Our technicians quickly got to work, carefully examining the device's hardware and determining the extent of the damage. They found that the water had seeped into the phone through the charging port, causing the center button to malfunction.

But what happened next was nothing short of extraordinary. After opening up the device, our technicians noticed that the water damage was not as severe as initially suspected. And to everyone's surprise, the center button was not damaged at all! The water had only affected the external components, including the charging port and the surrounding hardware.

Our technicians carefully cleaned the components and replaced the damaged parts, returning the iPhone 3G to its pristine condition. When the customer came to pick up her device, she was delighted to discover that the center button was working perfectly fine.

The lesson here is clear: Don't jump to conclusions about water damage. It's always best to take your phone to a professional who can diagnose the issue and provide an accurate assessment of the damage. Additionally, taking immediate action by turning off your phone and heading directly to a professional can save you a lot of trouble down the line.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing issues with your iPhone 3G or any other iPhone model, our expert technicians are always here to help. We pride ourselves on our ability to provide quick and effective repairs and offer exceptional customer service.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys,
So I took an 16gb 3G off of my grandfather's hands in an effort to sell it (as he had two for some reason). Anyway... I soon find out that the center button works about 75% of the time and sometimes refuses to work for a few hours - its under warranty but when I take it to Apple they tell me water must of sneaked up the charging area and therefore the warranty is no good.
The phone works in perfect condition other than this minor problem which only seems to happen every once in a while..... is there anyway to fix it? What am I looking at in terms of costs? Any insight is appreciated. Thanks

 well, sell it with the known fault honestly to the buyer
or FIX it yourself and end up with a phone that may not be any better and has a damaged shell.
if it is as you describe, someone easily will buy it as is, as opposed to a 'attemted fixed' one

 Can ifixit fix it?
