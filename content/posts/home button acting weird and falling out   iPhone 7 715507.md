# Is Your iPhone 7's Home Button Falling Out? Don't Panic - Here's What to Do!


If you're an iPhone 7 user, you might have noticed that the home button on your device is loose or wobbly. In some cases, it might even have fallen out completely. While this can be a concerning and frustrating issue, there are a few things you can do to address it.

First of all, it's important to understand why this problem is happening. The iPhone 7's home button isn't a physical button like it was on older models. Instead, it uses haptic feedback to simulate the sensation of pressing a button. This technology relies on a part of the phone called the Taptic Engine, which sits behind the home button.

Over time, the Taptic Engine can become damaged or displaced, which can cause the home button to become loose or fall out. If this has happened to your iPhone 7, here's what you can do to fix it.

## Check Your Warranty

Before you do anything else, check your iPhone 7's warranty. If your device is still covered, you may be able to get it fixed or replaced for free. Apple provides a one-year limited warranty on all new iPhones, and you can also purchase AppleCare+ for additional coverage. If your warranty is still valid, contact Apple support to arrange for a repair or replacement.

## Try a Calibration Reset

If your iPhone 7 is out of warranty, or if your warranty doesn't cover this type of issue, you can try a calibration reset. This will reset the Taptic Engine and may help to reposition it or fix any damage. Here's how to perform a calibration reset:

1. Open a stock app like Apple's built-in Clock app.
2. Hold down the power button until the "slide to power off" screen appears.
3. Release the power button and press and hold the home button until the screen returns to your home screen.
4. Wait a few seconds and see if the home button feels more secure.

If this doesn't work, you can try repeating the process a few times. If the home button is still loose or falls out, you may need to consider more drastic measures.

## Replace the Taptic Engine

If your iPhone 7's home button is still loose or falling out after trying a calibration reset, you may need to replace the Taptic Engine. This is a delicate and complex process, so it's not recommended for most users. However, if you're comfortable with electronics repair and have the necessary tools, you can purchase a replacement Taptic Engine online and follow a guide to install it.

If you're not comfortable with repairing your iPhone 7 yourself, you can take it to a professional repair shop. Just be aware that this can be an expensive option, and there's no guarantee that the repair will be successful.

## Consider Upgrading

If your iPhone 7 is out of warranty and you don't want to attempt a repair or pay for professional help, you may want to consider upgrading to a newer iPhone model. The iPhone 7 is now several years old, and newer models offer better performance, camera capabilities, and other features. The newer models also have more durable home buttons, so you're less likely to run into this problem in the future.

In conclusion, a loose or falling out home button on your iPhone 7 can be frustrating, but it's not necessarily the end of the world. You may be able to fix the issue with a calibration reset, or you may need to replace the Taptic Engine. If all else fails, you can consider upgrading to a newer iPhone model. Regardless of what you choose to do, don't panic - there are always options available.

## Chosen Solution
 It's a refurbished iPhone, presumably there was a screen replacement (judging by paled colors compared to my iPhone 5s with an original display). The button worked fine at first until I dropped the phone (the hit came on the top edge, the screen haven't been broken). After that Touch ID and the button functionality still works but now button reacts on any touch and doesn't react to pressure difference. I mean, it's enough to slightly touch it to have a response. I had to turn off Siri because it was activating faster then Touch ID.
In addition to that, the button have separeted from the screen and I can pull it out half way with something sharp.
Did anybody had something like this or does anybody know what is the problem?

So, i finally got my "Y" screwdriver and opened up my phone to try to fix that issue.
What I found out is that my "button" was probably replaced/repaired during refurbishing process. I think so, because it's not in one-piece anymore (steel cover on the back side of the button is separated from front side, where it is supposed to be welded). I tightened that screw anyway. But I can't confirm that it worked as intended, because I've cut one of the screen connecting flat wires

while trying to slide screen down to separate it. I guess that wire was responsible for 3D touch and home-button, because I lost 3D Touch, Touch ID. Home-button still works but now it's completely unusable (now it requires unreasonably hard press to get a response).
Is this cable replaceable, and if so, where can I buy it?
Should I make a separate question about it?

 The phone needs to be opened and have the screws tightened for the home button. There are 4 tri-wing screws that hold the home button bracket down.
