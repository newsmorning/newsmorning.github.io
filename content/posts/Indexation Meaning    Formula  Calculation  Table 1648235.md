Unlock the Secrets of Indexation! Learn the Formula, Calculation and Table for Ultimate Success!

Indexation refers to the process of adjusting values of a security or asset to account for inflation or changes in prices. It is a critical mechanism employed by financial analysts and investors to accurately evaluate the worth of an investment. Proper indexation helps to ensure that the value of investments is not eroded by inflation, and helps to provide a more accurate calculation of returns.

Indexation can be a complex subject, but understanding it is essential for success in the world of investing. In this article, we will explore the formula, calculation and table for ultimate success in indexation.

The Formula

The formula for indexation is relatively easy to understand. Essentially, it involves dividing the current value of an asset by its value at a base time, then multiplying the result by 100. This gives us what is known as an index value.

For example, suppose you have an investment worth $1,000 today, but its value 10 years ago was worth only $500. To calculate the index value, you would divide $1,000 by $500 and multiply the result by 100. The index value would, therefore, be 200.

The Calculation

The calculation of indexation involves a few additional steps beyond the basic formula. Firstly, you need to identify the base year that you are using as your reference point. This will be the year in which the investment was initially made.

Next, you need to find the consumer price index (CPI) for both the base year and the current year. The CPI measures the average price of a basket of goods and services over a specific period, and provides an indication of the inflation rate.

Once you have the CPI values for both the base year and the current year, you can then use the formula to calculate the index value.

The Table

To make the process of indexation easier, many financial analysts and investors use a table known as an index table. An index table lists the CPI values for each year between the base year and the current year, along with the corresponding index value.

Using an index table can save time and reduce the chances of errors in calculations. When using an index table, simply locate the CPI value for the current year and the base year and read off the corresponding index value.

Conclusion

Indexation is a key tool in the evaluation of investments, and understanding the formula, calculation and table is vital for success. By properly accounting for inflation and changes in prices, investors can better assess the true value of their investments and make informed decisions.

Whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting, mastering the art of indexation is a crucial step in your journey towards financial success. So take the time to learn the formula, calculation and table for ultimate success, and unlock the secrets of indexation today!

## Indexation Meaning
 
Investors commonly use this method to reduce taxes on the sale of investments. Since the adjusted purchase price of an asset (which is often higher than its actual purchase price) is considered, the return values are curtailed—lowering taxable income.

Key Takeaways

 
- Indexation is the mechanism of adjusting the values of various goods, services, assets, investments, and wages based on inflation. The indexation formula is as follows:                                                 Indexation = (Goods Value in the Given Year/Goods Value in the Base Year) × 100. It is a crucial technique used for ascertaining the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Cost Inflation Index (CII), Consumer Confidence Index (CCI), Business Confidence Index (BCI), Composite Index (COMP), and the Raw Material Price Index.

### Indexation Explained
 
Indexation helps recognize the adjusted value of goods, services, assets, and investments in a given year by comparing its value with a base year. The changes are mainly caused by inflation. For example, if the base year index of goods is taken to be 100, then its value in the given year is adjusted to identify a change. It is a crucial metric used by governments and businesses to adjust prices. 
 
Every financial year, the government issues an inflation index to show the impact of inflation on the prices of different products or services. The inflation index determines the real value of long-term investments. Further, it plays a key role in ascertaining consumer price indexConsumer Price IndexThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average price of a basket of regularly used consumer commodities compared to a base year. The CPI for the base year is 100, and this is the benchmark  point.read more, composite index, consumer confidence index, business confidence index, and raw material price index. Indexation is computed by registered authorities. In addition to inflation, It is used to adjust the cost of goods and discrepancy in wages.
 
### Indexation Table and Chart
 
An indexation table lists the index values of various investments, assets, goods, services, and wages. These values range over consecutive years and are presented in a tabular format. Given below is an example of the table:
 
This Consumer Price Index (CPI) table represents the changes in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) every month.
 
An indexation chart is the graphical presentation of the data mentioned in the corresponding indexation table. Analysts and viewers use it to determine the ups and downs of the index values quickly. Now, let us see the graph for the example mentioned above:

### Formula
 
It is the change in the value of a particular asset over time. It can be derived as the value of the goods in a given year divided by its value in the base year, multiplied by 100. The equation is as follows:
 
Here, the given year is the relevant fiscal year for which the index of goods or services is evaluated. The base year is the purchase year, and the price so stated is the actual purchase price of the product, asset, or investment.
 
### Calculation
 
Indexing requires an accurate calculation of the values and the choice of a suitable base year.
 
- The first step is to ascertain the relevant base year. This is usually done by authorized agencies.The next step is to ascertain the value of the goods in the base year.Then, the value of goods for the given year is ascertained. To determine the final value, apply the indexation formula:Indexation = (Goods value in the given year/Goods value in the base year) X 100.

 
The result obtained is the price index for the particular product and can vary from year to year. Thus, comparing various time frames is essential to predict future price indexes. On top of expertise in the field, preparing an index requires knowledge of the locale’s prevalent economic and social scenarios.
 
### Indexation Example
 
Let us look at a numerical. The last six years gold prices for the US are listed below:

Now, based on the above data, determine the gold price index for all mentioned years. Use 2017 as the base year.
 
Solution:
 
Clearly, January 2019 price index is slightly lower than January 2018 price index. But after that, the trend reversed. The price index accelerated all the way to 158.38 in January 2021. After 2021, the value falls a bit, down to 151.71 in January 2022.
 
### Benefits
 
Indexing is beneficial for the following reasons.
 
- The Cost Inflation Index (CII) aids in reducing the tax burden of investors by lowering the taxable incomeTaxable IncomeThe taxable income formula calculates the total income taxable under the income tax. It differs based on whether you are calculating the taxable income for an individual or a business corporation.read more because the adjusted value of an investment (usually higher than the actual purchase price) shows lesser profits.Enterprises employ this technique to remove worker wage disputes. Indexes standardize pay—workers get fair wages even during economic downturns.The companies use raw material price indexes to normalize fluctuations in raw materialRaw MaterialRaw materials refer to unfinished substances or unrefined natural resources used to manufacture finished goods.read more costs. This eventually helps modify the cost price and selling price.It even facilitates the adjustment of the prices among two substitute goods available in the market.In addition to price indexation, the confidence level among the businesses and consumers is also calculated.It helps the government determine the change in goods and service values due to inflation—Consumer Price Index (CPI).It is used in determining the cost of living for different demographics.
