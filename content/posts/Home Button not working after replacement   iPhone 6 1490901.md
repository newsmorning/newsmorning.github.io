Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Replace My iPhone 6 Home Button… Hint: It's Driving Me Crazy!

Introduction
As an iPhone user, I understand the importance of having a functional device. The home button is one of the primary components of the iPhone, and its functionality is crucial for navigating the device. Recently, my iPhone 6 home button started acting up, and I decided to replace it. Little did I know that my mission to fix the problem would lead to an even bigger issue. 

The Issue
The problem with the home button began as a minor inconvenience, with the button not working smoothly. It required more force than usual to register a click, but it wasn't a significant issue. I took the device to the local repair shop, and they advised me to replace the home button. I decided to purchase a home button replacement online, which was much cheaper than getting it fixed at the repair shop. 

Replacing the Home Button
Replacing an iPhone home button requires some level of technical know-how. However, I was confident in my abilities as I had fixed a couple of iPhones before. I watched several YouTube tutorials and read step-by-step instructions online. Everything seemed straightforward, and I followed all the instructions carefully. After an hour of carefully dismantling and reassembling the device, I was confident I had done a great job. 

The Aftermath 
I turned on the iPhone to test the new home button and to my surprise, the device just wouldn't boot up. It only displayed the Apple logo before turning off again repeatedly. I was shocked and devastated, to say the least. I tried several times to boot it up, but the problem persisted. I decided to take it to the technician, and he informed me that the replacement of the home button was the problem. 

Ultimately, he was able to fix the device, but at a higher cost than I had planned. The technician explained to me that replacing the home button of the iPhone is more complicated than it seems. It involves tampering with the logic board of the device, which is risky, and only experienced technicians should do it. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, I learned a valuable lesson on the importance of seeking professional help in repairing sensitive parts of my iPhone. It's easy to be tempted to save a few bucks by attempting DIY repairs, but it could lead to significant complications. In my case, I ended up paying more than I had planned, and the device was out of commission for days. I hope my experience assists those inclined to attempting DIY repairs to be cautious and ensure they understand the risk before making the decision.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I have replaced home button on my iPhone 6 and the touch ID is not working (as expected) but now the home button it self is playing up. I have to use Sleep/power button to wake up the screen. if i press home button (when the screen is turned off) nothing happens but when i use the sleep/power button the the screen wakes up, once the screen is on the home button works perfectly. I tried calibrating the home button and tried factory reset no joy, Can anyone please help me.
Regards,

 The button will not wake the phone up once it's gone off. It will only work for around 5 seconds after
