# Is Your GoPro Hero4 Black at Risk?! The 4 Most Common Component Failures You NEED to Know Before It's Too Late!

If you're an avid adventurer, sports enthusiast, or just someone who loves capturing the moment, the GoPro Hero4 Black is the perfect companion for you. With its high-quality video and photo capabilities, rugged design, and versatility, this camera has become an essential accessory for many. However, like any device, it is susceptible to damage, and components can fail over time.

In this article, we'll explore the four most common component failures of the GoPro Hero4 Black and provide tips on how you can avoid them to ensure your device lasts as long as possible.

## Battery Failure

One of the most common problems with the GoPro Hero4 Black is battery failure. Battery life degrades with use and time, and it's not uncommon for the battery to die quickly, even when fully charged. If your GoPro's battery is failing, you'll notice shorter recording times, difficulty powering on the device, and frequent shutdowns.

To avoid battery failure, store your GoPro in a cool, dry place when not in use. Avoid charging the battery overnight and leave it to charge for no more than two hours at a time. Also, invest in a backup battery or two so that you can always have a charged spare on hand.

## Lens Scratches

The lens is the most critical component of your GoPro Hero4 Black because it's what captures your memories. Unfortunately, the lens is also susceptible to scratching, which can impact photo and video quality. Scratches can occur when the camera is not stored in a protective case or when it's dropped or scraped against a rough surface.

To avoid lens scratches, always use a protective case when you're not actively using the camera. Invest in a high-quality lens protector, and replace it if there are any signs of damage. When cleaning the lens, use a soft, dry cloth to avoid scratching the surface.

## Button Failure

Another common component failure of the GoPro Hero4 Black is button failure. The device's buttons can wear out over time, making it challenging to start and stop recordings, switch between modes, and navigate settings.

To avoid button failure, avoid using excessive force when pressing the buttons. Be mindful of your surroundings and avoid exposing your GoPro to excessive vibrations and shocks. If you notice button failure, take your device to a professional technician or contact GoPro customer support.

## SD Card Corruption

The GoPro Hero4 Black relies on SD cards to store photos and videos. SD cards can experience corruption due to a failure in the card's hardware, a data error, or a virus attack. Corrupted SD cards can result in the loss of all your data, making it essential to maintain the integrity of your SD card at all times.

To avoid SD card corruption, use a high-quality, compatible SD card with your GoPro. Avoid removing the SD card while it's still writing data, and always unmount it from the device before removing it. Be sure to format the SD card regularly to prevent data errors and virus attacks.

In conclusion, the GoPro Hero4 Black is a powerful and versatile device that can help you record your most exciting moments. By being mindful of common component failures like battery failure, lens scratches, button failure, and SD card corruption, you can ensure that your device lasts as long as possible. With proper care and maintenance, your GoPro can continue to capture and inspire for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 new  Hero 4  black submerged in salt water for 7 minutes.  After thoroughly rinsing with distilled  water then drying the camera, I let it  rest in rice for  5 days. Now it won't power up, make noise, or` give any indication of life left.

 I had a GoPro Hero 4 Black sit at the bottom of the ocean for three days in a leaking waterproof case until a diver friend retrieved it for me.
Amazingly, I was able to get it to power on.
But I did the following first:
Dismantled the GoPro immediately and washed all components in isopropyl alcohol.Ensure that all traces of corrosion (white) were washed off and that all metal contacts were cleanLet the components dry for several days
Now the GoPro didn't work 100% and required some parts to be replaced.
What worked:
WiFiHDMI outputLens & sensorPower and WiFi/Setup buttons
What didn't work:
Some of the LEDsThe LCD displayThe shutter buttonThe SD card expansion slotThe battery (it swelled and oozed)
Considering that your GoPro was only submerged for 7 minutes, chances are that yours is in better condition than mine was and so you may be able to salvage much of it and even possibly repair it to fully working order.
