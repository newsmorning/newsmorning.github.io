Title: You Won't Believe the Secret Adhesive We Used to Fix Our Fitbit Ionic After Battery Replacement!

The Fitbit Ionic is an incredible fitness tracker and smartwatch that is known for its long battery life. However, even the best batteries can wear out eventually, and you might need to replace them. As easy as it may seem to replace the battery, fixing a Fitbit Ionic after battery replacement can be daunting. The challenge of ensuring that the battery stays in place and that the device still looks sleek can be overwhelming.

Recently, we faced this challenge when we had to replace the battery of a Fitbit Ionic. We tried different types of adhesive, but they either failed to stick to the device or ruined the aesthetics of the smartwatch. That’s when we stumbled upon a secret adhesive that worked wonders and helped us fix the Fitbit Ionic like new.

The adhesive we used is called Double-Sided Adhesive Tape, which can be found at any hardware store or online retailer. This tape is incredibly strong, with a thickness of 0.6mm and a tensile strength of 25lbs. Its adhesive is protected by a paper backing that peels off easily, making it simple to apply. The tape can be trimmed to size and can be cut around the battery compartments, creating a custom fit that will keep your device in place.

We were impressed by how effective and easy it was to use Double-Sided Adhesive Tape. The tape held the battery in place with a strong grip, and it also gave the watch a polished and professional look. The tape is also waterproof, so it was a bonus that we no longer had to worry about sweat or water damage.

We recommend using the Double-Sided Adhesive Tape for any type of smartwatch repair, including battery replacements. It is inexpensive and easy to use, and you can get it from most hardware stores or online retailers. Just make sure to trim the tape carefully to avoid obstructing any sensors or buttons.

In conclusion, if you’re looking for a secret adhesive to fix your Fitbit Ionic or any other smartwatch after battery replacement, try the Double-Sided Adhesive Tape. You won’t believe how easy it is to use, and your device will look as good as new. Give it a try and see the difference it can make!

## Chosen Solution
 I am in the process of replacing the battery in my Fitbit Ionic but I don’t see adhesive listed under the parts or tools list, which is needed (and noted) for proper reassembly.  Can someone recommend something similar to what Fitbit uses?  I’m not going to use super glue in case I need to replace the screen battery again.  Thank you.

 typically you can use something like Tesa 61395 Tape
or
Polyimide Tape
be sure to read the descriptions on them to see what would work better for you
good luck
