If you're the proud owner of an LG OLED65B7AU TV, you may have come across a common issue that has left many scratching their heads. The problem is a steady red LED and four slow blinks that appear when you turn on your TV – which implies that there's something wrong with it.

But what exactly does this mean? And what can you do to fix it?

In this article, we'll dive into the details of this issue and give you some tips on how to tackle it head-on.

Understanding the Steady Red LED and Four Slow Blinks

When you turn on your LG OLED65B7AU TV, you'll see a steady red LED light on the front panel. This light typically stays on for a few seconds before turning off. However, if there's an issue with the TV, the light may stay on for an extended period of time, indicating a problem.

More specifically, if you notice four slow blinks accompanying the steady red LED light, it's likely that there's an issue with your TV's power supply.

Why Does This Happen?

The main reason for the steady red LED and four slow blinks is a faulty power supply. This could be due to various factors such as a power surge, a blown fuse, or a defective component within the power supply unit.

Whatever the reason, the issue with the power supply is preventing the TV from turning on correctly, thus leading to the blinking red LED.

What Can You Do About It?

Luckily, there are a few things you can try to fix the issue with your LG OLED65B7AU TV.

1. Power reset: Try resetting the TV by unplugging it from the power source and waiting for a few minutes before plugging it back in. This can sometimes help reset the power supply unit and get the TV back up and running.

2. Check the fuses: If a fuse has blown, it can interrupt the TV's power supply and cause the red LED to blink. Check the fuses on the TV's power board to see if any have blown and replace them if necessary.

3. Contact LG: If neither of the above work, it's best to contact LG's customer service for assistance. They may be able to help troubleshoot the issue further and provide a solution.

In Conclusion

If you come across the steady red LED and four slow blinks on your LG OLED65B7AU TV, don't panic. It's likely a fixable issue stemming from a faulty power supply.

Try resetting the TV or checking the fuses on the power board. If those steps don't work, reach out to LG's customer service for further assistance. With some patience and perseverance, you can get your TV up and running again in no time.


## Chosen Solution
 I have been searching online for an LED code reference or service manual without luck. I am hoping this is an easy fix like replacing the power supply board. If you have a link to a service manual or any information such as checking voltages I would really appreciate you sharing it. Thanks.

 Hi @charlescc
Don’t know the model but here’s the service manual.
Unfortunately it’s not for free but it may be worth buying it anyway.
