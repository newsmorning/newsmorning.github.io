# Desperate for your HBO Fix? Here's the Ultimate Guide to Fixing HBO Go or HBO Now Not Working!

As a fan of hit HBO shows like Game of Thrones, Westworld, and True Detective, there's nothing worse than having technical issues with your HBO Go or HBO Now app. Whether the app isn't loading, the video is buffering, or the sound isn't syncing, these issues can be frustrating and may prevent you from enjoying your favorite shows. If you're desperate for your HBO fix and struggling with technical issues, here's the ultimate guide to fixing HBO Go or HBO Now not working!

## Check Your Internet Connection

Before troubleshooting the app itself, it's important to check your internet connection. These apps require a stable internet connection to stream content. If your connection is weak or unstable, it can cause issues like buffering, lagging, and poor video quality. You can check your internet connection by running a speed test on your device, such as speedtest.net. If your internet speed is too slow or your signal is weak, try resetting your modem or router, or consider upgrading your internet plan.

## Check Your Device and App Compatibility

Another common issue with HBO Go or HBO Now not working is device compatibility. Make sure that the device you're using to stream HBO is compatible with the app. HBO Go and HBO Now are available on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, smart TVs, and streaming sticks. However, if you're using an older device or an unsupported operating system, you may experience issues. Check the HBO website for a list of supported devices and system requirements.

## Update the App and Operating System

If your internet connection and device are compatible, but you're still experiencing issues with HBO Go or HBO Now, the next step is to check for available updates. Make sure that the app and your device's operating system are up-to-date. Outdated apps and operating systems may cause compatibility issues and technical glitches. You can check for updates in your device's app store or system settings.

## Clear Cache and Data

If you've checked your internet connection, device compatibility, and updates, but you're still experiencing issues with HBO Go or HBO Now, try clearing the app's cache and data. Clearing the cache and data can help fix issues with apps loading, freezing, or crashing. To clear the cache and data, go to your device's app settings, find HBO Go or HBO Now, and select "Storage." From here, you can clear the cache and data. Keep in mind that clearing data will delete your login information, so make sure to have your login credentials handy.

## Reinstall the App

If all else fails, try uninstalling and reinstalling the HBO Go or HBO Now app. The app may have become corrupted or damaged, which can cause issues when streaming content. Uninstall the app by going to your device's app settings, find HBO Go or HBO Now, and select "Uninstall." Then, reinstall the app by going to your device's app store and downloading it again.

In Conclusion

If you're desperate for your HBO fix and struggling with technical issues with HBO Go or HBO Now, this guide should help you troubleshoot and fix the issues. By checking your internet connection, device and app compatibility, updating the app and operating system, clearing cache and data, and reinstalling the app, you should be able to stream your favorite HBO shows without technical issues.
