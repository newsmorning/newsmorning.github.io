Title: You Won't Believe It! I Changed My iPad 4 Wi-Fi Lightning Port and Still Getting NO Response - Find Out What to Do Next!

Introduction:
The iPad 4 Wi-Fi Lightning port is the primary point of connectivity to charge and transfer data to and from the device. Without a functional charging or lighting port, your iPad 4 could be rendered useless. However, it can be frustrating when you've changed your iPad 4 Wi-Fi Lightning port, and you're still getting no response. So, what can you do next? In this article, we'll explore some troubleshooting tips to help you get your iPad 4 functioning again.

Step 1: Inspect the Lightning cable
The first thing to check when experiencing problems with your iPad 4 Wi-Fi Lightning port is the Lightning cable. Check to see if there are any cracks or breaks in the wiring or if the pins are bent or corroded. If there are any issues with the cable, you should replace it with a new one. Also, ensure that you're using a compatible Lightning cable that's designed for the iPad 4 Wi-Fi.

Step 2: Clean the Lightning port
Sometimes, dirt, dust, and other debris may accumulate and prevent the Lightning port from making a strong connection. If the port's connections are weak, you'll experience problems like not charging or transferring data. So, use a soft-bristled brush or a toothbrush to clean the port gently. You could also use a can of compressed air to blow out any debris or dirt. Be cautious not to put too much pressure on the port or use water or any fluid as this may cause further damage.

Step 3: Hard reset
If cleaning the port didn't solve the problem, try performing a hard reset. It's a simple process that involves holding down the home button and power button for about ten seconds until the screen goes black. Release the buttons and then hold down the power button until the Apple logo appears. If your iPad 4 was not damaged by water, this should restart the device and refresh its systems.

Step 4: Restore your iPad 4
If none of the above steps resolves the problem, you can try restoring your iPad 4. This process involves erasing all the data and settings on your device, so you'll need to back up your files before attempting this step. Connect your iPad 4 to your PC or Mac using iTunes, and follow the on-screen instructions to restore the device to its factory settings. After restoring the device, you can then restore your files and settings from your backup.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the iPad 4 Wi-Fi Lightning port is essential for charging and transferring data from the device. However, problems may arise from time to time, and you may encounter situations where changing the port doesn't solve the issue. These troubleshooting tips should help you get your iPad 4 back in working order. Whatever you do, it's important to be gentle and cautious when handling the port and other parts of your system. Our recommendation always is, if in doubt, seek the advice and support of a professional.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I was given a 4th gen ipad and the previous owner had tried to solder in the lightning port- no this is not a typo, he actually tried to solder in the lightning port!! I have now managed to successfully (kinda) change the lightning port. I still have no response and charging it for an hour. I have tried holding the power button, and I have tried holding both the power button and home button simultaneously to do a hard reset- still nothing
I downloaded the latest version of itunes and plugged my ipad into the computer, it does not register a device being plugged in. I don't know where to look next, power button? battery?
or should i just cut my losses on the lightning port and adhesive strip and not waste any more time?
thanks in advance for any advise,
Cody

 Hello!
Can the new port be damaged? Change the port only or the complete flex?
The previous owner may damage the plate if soldered with the battery connected and some component of the plate will work.
If you are sure that the load flex is OK, look for something that is not between the plate and the battery contact. Nor would it be enough to disconnect it a few seconds and reconnect. After this, if everything seems correct, connect it to the computer and leave it connected 1h. If after this itunes does not recognize the ipad, it could be a damaged battery or a motherboard failure. Anyway, I would not rule out a defective cargo flex.

 Do you mean he soldered the lightning cable in or the port on? either way, seems its having problems.
