# You won't believe what Logitech and Tencent have created for gaming on the go!

In the world of gaming, nobody wants to be tethered to a desk for hours on end. That's why Logitech and Tencent have teamed up to create the ultimate gaming experience on the go with their new Mobile Gaming Touchpad. If you're a gamer who wants to game anywhere, anytime, and on any device, you're going to want to check this out.

The Mobile Gaming Touchpad is a portable gaming accessory designed to work seamlessly with your smartphone or tablet. It's a small, but powerful, device that looks like a trackpad but functions like a controller. You can use it to play games like PUBG, Fortnite, and Call of Duty, and you'll be blown away by how much it enhances your gaming experience.

One of the best things about this device is its size. It's small enough to fit in your pocket, making it incredibly easy to take with you wherever you go. It's designed to work with both iOS and Android devices, so no matter what kind of phone or tablet you have, you'll be able to use it. And with a battery life of up to 70 hours, you won't have to worry about it dying on you in the middle of a game.

Another great feature of the Mobile Gaming Touchpad is its customization options. You can customize the buttons and layout to fit your specific needs and preferences. The device also comes with a companion app that lets you create and save multiple custom layouts, so you can switch between them depending on the game you're playing.

Perhaps the most impressive thing about the Mobile Gaming Touchpad is its accuracy and responsiveness. It uses Logitech's exclusive Delta Zero sensor technology, which delivers precise, reliable, and fast movement with minimal lag. Whether you're aiming down sights in a shooter or executing quick turns in a racing game, you'll feel like you're using a top-of-the-line controller.

So, if you're a gamer who wants to take your gaming on the go, you should definitely check out Logitech and Tencent's Mobile Gaming Touchpad. With its portability, customization options, and accuracy, it's the ultimate gaming accessory for anyone who wants to game anywhere, anytime, and on any device.

Tencent Holdings and Logitech G are joining forces to make... a handheld gaming console?

 

Don't expect Tencent and Logitech's hardware to be a direct Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch competitor, though, as the device (which looks to still be in the planning stages) will act as a hub for cloud gaming. So you won't buy physical games for it or purchase digital copies on a company-specific online marketplace. Instead, you'll be able to access multiple cloud gaming services from one travel-sized device.

 

"Multiple cloud gaming services" will be supported, with Logitech mentioning it's also working with NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Xbox Cloud Gaming on the project. Whether or not this means the new device will support those services, only those services or additional as-of-yet unnamed services remains to be seen. Regardless, it does mean you'd be able to carry around a handheld gaming system with the potential to play just about any PC game—provided it's available on the service.

 

Neither Logitech nor Tencent have indicated how they plan to deal with the limitations of game streaming, however. These kinds of services can still be somewhat hampered by connection issues or slow internet connections—problems that are more likely to crop up when traveling. Unfettered access to multiple game streaming libraries may not be as impressive if you can't find a strong enough signal in your hotel or while on the train.

 

For now, the only thing we know for sure is this handheld game streaming device is in development. Dates, specifications, and a full list of supported cloud gaming services just aren't available right now. However, if you'd like Logitech to keep you in the loop, you can sign up for email updates.
