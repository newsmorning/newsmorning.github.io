But like any other operating system, Ubuntu can become sluggish over time. Fortunately, there are several strategies you can employ to rev up your Ubuntu game and supercharge your system. Here are six easily implementable steps to make your Ubuntu system snappier, faster, and more efficient.\nUpgrade your Ubuntu operating system First and foremost, you need to ensure that your Ubuntu operating system is updated to the latest version. Ubuntu is updated regularly with new features, bug fixes, and security patches. By updating your system, you can ensure that your operating system runs smoothly and is optimized for best performance.\nTo check for updates, click on the notification icon in your system’s upper right corner. If any updates are available, follow the prompts to install them.\nGet rid of old and unused packages Over time, Ubuntu accumulates old and unused packages that take up valuable disk space and slow down your system. To get rid of these packages, go to the terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nThis command removes all packages that are no longer needed and frees up valuable space on your hard disk.\nUse lightweight applications While many applications have rich user interfaces and advanced features, they can also hog system resources and slow down your system. To speed up your Ubuntu experience, switch to lightweight applications that do not consume your system’s resources.\nFor example, instead of using resource-intensive applications like Firefox or Chrome, use lightweight browsers like Midori or Lynx. Similarly, instead of a heavy editor like LibreOffice, use something like Gedit or Mousepad.\nOptimize your Ubuntu kernel By tweaking your system’s kernel, you can significantly boost your system’s performance. The kernel is responsible for managing your system hardware and tasks, and a poorly configured kernel can slow down your system.\nTo optimize your kernel, download and install the Ubuntu Mainline Kernel utility. This utility allows you to install newer kernels, which can improve performance and resolve issues.\nUse SSD for Ubuntu boot Solid State Drives (SSDs) are much faster than traditional hard drives and can significantly speed up your boot time. Installing Ubuntu on an SSD will result in shorter load times and faster system access.\nEnable TRIM When using an SSD for your Ubuntu system, it is essential to enable TRIM. TRIM is a command that helps the SSD to erase unused blocks of data, improving performance over time.\nTo enable TRIM, enter the following command into the terminal:\nsudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer\nConclusion\nBy following these six easy steps, you can supercharge your Ubuntu system and improve its performance. Upgrading your system, removing unused packages, using lightweight applications, optimizing your kernel, installing an SSD, and enabling TRIM are all simple tweaks that yield remarkable results. Rev up your Ubuntu game today by implementing these six steps and enjoy a faster, smoother, and more efficient operating system.\nHave you noticed your Ubuntu system’s performance has slowed down? Even though Ubuntu 18.04 (the most recent version) is a very powerful Linux distribution, over time, your installation can become sluggish.\nThere are a variety of factors that can affect the speed of your system, including:\nThe number of programs you have downloadedLow virtual memoryNot enough free disk spaceConfiguration settings that are not optimal Below are six easy ways to speed up and optimize your installation.\nRestart Your Computer Although this step might sound like an obvious one, it isn’t for regular Linux users. The reason for this is that generally there is no need to restart a Linux system.\nIt is well known for its ability to run for a long time without needing to reboot your computer. However, over time, the running processes may accumulate and drag down your speed.\nRather than manually deleting temporary files, it’s much easier to restart your computer.\nIf your system has slowed down to a point where you can’t access the system menu, hold the power button until it powers off.\nEdit Auto Startup Applications When you start your machine, you have many applications that are set to begin once your device has booted.\nHowever, do you really need all of them set to auto-start? This takes up a lot of memory. Which applications are launched when rebooting can be edited in the Startup Applications utility.\nThe process is simple.\nClick on the Startup Applications icon.You will see a screen like the one in the above image.See which items are listed in the startup application.Choose add, remove, or edit.If you don’t need any app selected to run at startup, click remove. Only include the most important software or Ubuntu applications that you always need and remove the ones that you don’t.\nUse Preload Preload is a background service that monitors and keeps track of the applications you use frequently. It remembers the binaries and libraries used and caches them in memory.\nThe result is your apps will load much faster than they would without using Preload.\nAs an example, if you always use Firefox when you start working on your computer, the files are loaded into memory. So, when you log into your computer, Firefox will load faster.\nNot all distributions of Ubuntu install Preload by default. It’s easy to install. Simply run the command below:\nsudo apt-get install preload\nPreload will run in the background of your system and speed it up. If you have a lot of memory, the increase in speed can be significant, anywhere from 20% to 60%.\nIt will take a little bit of time for Preload to learn which applications you use most frequently.\nFree Up Disc Space It is always helpful to clean up clutter in your system storage to make room for new files and programs. This is most important if you have limited storage capacity.\nEven though Ubuntu is a light operating system, it may present an issue with storage mainly because it doesn’t delete downloaded and installed software packages.\nEmpty Trash Removing temporary and trash files from your computer not only gets rid of files you don’t need; it also frees up hard drive space.\nOpen your file manager and right-click on the trash icon. To permanently delete these files, select the “empty trash” option.\nDelete Temporary Files There are many files on your computer that take up a lot of space. For example, temporary files, browser histories, and caches.\nDeleting these files will free up some space on your system. Look in your Software Center for the cleanup program called BleachBit.\nOnce you have downloaded BleachBit, you need to install and run it. It will free up disk space and guard your privacy.\nAnalyze Your Disk Usage It is possible that you have very large files that you don’t need taking up too much space. Ubuntu Linux has a tool called the Disk Usage Analyzer.\nIt will scan your folders and files and show you a graphical view of which directories are taking up the biggest chunk of space. You can access this tool through your Ubuntu dashboard.\nModify Grub Configuration By default, the Grub Configuration provides a delay of 10 seconds to choose from which operating system you want to boot. You can go into that configuration and reduce the time to 2 seconds. This would save you 8 seconds to reboot.\nTo set this command, change:\n“GRUB_TIMEOUT=10” to “GRUB_TIMEOUT=2”\nSoftware Updates Mirror Choose the best server for Ubuntu to get its updates. Go to Application Drawer.Search for Software \u0026 Update.Select Ubuntu Software.Choose Best Server. This is especially helpful for those with a slower Internet connection. Your system will start a test in search of the closest server where it will access the update files faster when performing an upgrade or update.\nNot only will this speed up your Ubuntu system, but it will also install any required drivers that are missing and include all new security bug fixes.\nTaking these six steps will speed up your Ubuntu installation.\n","wordCount":"1346","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Stephen Forbis"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/6-easy-ways-to-speed-up-your-ubuntu-installation883591/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Rev Up Your Ubuntu Game In 6 Easy Steps: Supercharge Your System NOW!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1346 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Stephen Forbis</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#restart-your-computer>Restart Your Computer</a></li><li><a href=#edit-auto-startup-applications>Edit Auto Startup Applications</a></li><li><a href=#use-preload>Use Preload</a></li><li><a href=#free-up-disc-space>Free Up Disc Space</a><ul><li></li></ul></li><li><a href=#modify-grub-configuration>Modify Grub Configuration</a></li><li><a href=#software-updates-mirror>Software Updates Mirror</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Rev Up Your Ubuntu Game In 6 Easy Steps: Supercharge Your System NOW!</p><p>Ubuntu is one of the most popular operating systems used worldwide, popular for its stability, security, and ease of use.
