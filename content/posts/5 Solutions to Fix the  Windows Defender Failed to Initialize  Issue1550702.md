7. Click "Add or remove exclusions" and then "Add an exclusion."
8. Choose "Folder" and add the "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender" folder.
9. Restart your system and reinstall Windows Defender.

Solution 5: Use a Reliable Third-Party Antivirus Program

If all the above solutions fail to work, you may explore using a third-party antivirus program, as they can provide better protection than Windows Defender. Ensure that you choose a reliable software program, and it is used to protect your system from any potential security threats.
