# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed My iPhone 4S Charge Port - Home Button Fails!

It was a regular day when I decided to change my iPhone 4S charge port. I had used my phone for a couple of years, and the charge port had started to act up. It was getting harder to charge my phone, and I had to position the charger just right, or it wouldn't charge at all. I looked for some DIY tutorials on how to replace the charge port, and I found one that looked easy enough. So, armed with the necessary tools, I embarked on a journey to fix my phone.

The first step was to dismantle the phone. I had watched the tutorial several times, and I was confident I knew what I was doing. I started by unscrewing the screws holding the phone's back panel, and then I carefully removed the panel. I could see the battery, the logic board, and the charge port. I then disconnected the ribbon cables that connected the screen to the logic board and unscrewed the logic board to gain access to the charge port.

The next step was to remove the old charge port and replace it with a new one. I carefully detached the old charge port and replaced it with the new one. I screwed everything back together and reconnected the ribbon cables. It was time to test if the charge port was working correctly.

I plugged my phone to a charger, and voila! It worked perfectly. I felt a sense of satisfaction that I had fixed my phone, and it wasn't going to die on me anytime soon. My joy was short-lived when I noticed that the home button had stopped working.

I tried pushing the button a couple of times, but nothing happened. I thought I had accidentally detached a cable or misplaced a screw. So, I decided to open up the phone and check what was wrong. It turned out that the home button cable was now disconnected, and I had to reconnect it.

I reconnected the home button cable and tested it. It worked! The home button was back to life, and everything was working correctly. I must admit that I was a bit nervous during the whole process, but I was glad that I had managed to fix my iPhone on my own.

If you're thinking of changing your iPhone's charge port, just know that it might affect other components like the home button. Be sure to follow the tutorial correctly, and if you're unsure, seek professional help. Changing the charge port may not be as straightforward as it looks, but with the right tools and knowledge, you can do it.

## Chosen Solution
 So I replaced my charge port on my iPhone 4S and now that works like a charm, but now my home button does not work at all. Any thoghts?

 Did you reconnect the home button flex to the new charge port connector? Or home button flex  is not connected correctly. Home button flex could have been damaged during repair. New charge port may be faulty.

 Could be a monkey wrench stuck in there. Or a yard gnome.
But seriously, EXACTLY the same symptoms here.
