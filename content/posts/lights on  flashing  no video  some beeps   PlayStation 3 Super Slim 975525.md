## Chosen Solution
 Haven’t used my ps3 for a while. looks like its powering up, green light, yellow HDD flashes, but no video. any ideas?

 I bought a replacement PS3, it had the same issue. tried both units on a different TV and both worked fine. the original TV works fine with other devices like roku and cable tv, but there was something about the interaction between the PS3 , HDMI cable and the TV. I ended up adding a HDMI switch between the PS3 and the TV and it started working again.
