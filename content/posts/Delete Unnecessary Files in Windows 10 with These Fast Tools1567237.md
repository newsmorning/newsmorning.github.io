You can take the manual approach, but it isn’t always very effective and is highly time-consuming and risky. Many inadvertently removed critical system files and had to reinstall the OS.
 
Use specialized software to clean up your PC to ensure you don’t delete anything valuable. And we have the perfect ones for you.
 
## What files should I delete to free up space?
 
If you are wondering how to delete junk files from your PC, here are a few quick ways:
 
- Empty the Recycle Bin: The Recycle Bin stores files for a certain period after they are deleted, but if you are certain about not needing them again, empty it right away.

However, remember that none offer the same efficiency level as specialized software. These will find even the smallest of the files created by apps and remove them all. However, when it comes to scanning and deleting junk files, there’s no match for these. 
 
Is it safe to delete junk files?
 
As long as you are careful not to delete any critical files, there’s no harm in it. And it’s recommended that you regularly scan and delete junk files in Windows. Moreover, you can choose to backup your system to make sure you can undo any damage.
