Laptops are an essential part of our daily lives. We use them for work, entertainment, and communication. Like any other gadget, laptops are susceptible to damage and malfunction. One of the most common problems laptop owners face is when their device refuses to turn on after disassembly. This can be frustrating, especially if you are not sure what caused the issue. In this article, we will discuss the reasons why Acer laptops refuse to turn on after disassembly and how to fix them.

##Reasons why an Acer Laptop will refuse to turn on

###Loose connection

When you disassemble or assemble your Acer device, there could be a loose connection that causes it to refuse to turn on. Loose connections can occur when you don't plug the cables correctly, or when the cables are damaged. When this happens, the laptop won't turn on and you will need to check the connections to fix the problem.

###Damaged power button

Acer laptops use a power button to turn on and off. If your laptop refuses to turn on after disassembly, the power button may be damaged. The power button can become defective if it is accidentally pushed too hard or if it is handled roughly. The solution for a defective power button is to replace it.

###Dead battery

If your Acer laptop refuses to turn on after disassembly, one of the reasons could be a dead battery. Laptops use rechargeable batteries, so it's possible that your battery has reached its end of life. If the battery is dead, the laptop won't turn on even if you plug it into a power source. The solution for a dead battery is to replace it with a new one.

###Hardware failure

Another reason why your Acer laptop refuses to turn on after disassembly could be hardware failure. Hardware failure can happen when one or more components of the laptop are damaged or malfunctioning. The most common hardware failures on laptops are the motherboard, hard drive, and RAM. The solution for hardware failure is to replace the damaged parts with new ones.

##How to fix an Acer laptop that refuses to turn on after disassembly

The first step in fixing your Acer laptop that refuses to turn on after disassembly is to identify the cause. Once you have identified the cause, you can proceed with the appropriate fix. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Check for loose connections. Make sure that all cables are connected correctly and that there are no signs of damage.

2. Check the power button. If the power button is defective, replace it with a new one.

3. Check the battery. If the battery is dead, replace it with a new one.

4. Check for hardware failure. If there is hardware failure, replace the damaged parts with new ones.

5. Reassemble the laptop. Once the problem is fixed, reassemble the laptop and turn it on to see if it works.

Conclusion

If your Acer laptop refuses to turn on after disassembly, there are several reasons why this could be happening. Loose connections, a defective power button, a dead battery, and hardware failure are the most common reasons for this problem. To fix the problem, you need to identify the cause and follow the appropriate solution. Remember to always handle your laptop with care, especially when disassembling or assembling it.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently bought an old Acer U13S laptop. I took it apart to use the motherboard for a project, and now I can’t get it to turn on. To clarify, the lights are on, the fan is on, the CPU heats up, and the drive makes noises, but the screen doesn’t show the Acer logo, or boot to BIOS. I checked the RAM, and disconnected and reconnected the CPU. When I plug it in to an external display via HDMI, it shows nothing. The screen turns on, ever-so-slightly changing colour. Does anyone know why this is happening, or how I could fix it?

 If the screen only changes color slightly when you turn on the computer, the problem could be with your LCD display  inverter. A laptop’s display inverter is a small circuit board, usually about the size of a pen, that illuminates the screen. If the inverter is damaged or not hooked up correctly, then the screen will not light up properly.
I would check the inverter’s connections at both ends, and then replace it if damaged.
