## Delete Previous Windows Installations (Windows.old)
 
When you upgrade from an older version of Windows (7/8) to Windows 10, your computer creates Windows.old folder and keeps the previous Windows installation files saved in this folder.
 
Windows.old folder is also created when you perform a clean installation of Windows 10 without formatting the drive containing Previous Windows installation.
 
This precautionary measure in Windows OS is designed to allow users to switch back to the previous version of Windows, if the latest version is not working properly.
 
However, if the latest version of Windows is working fine, there is no need to allow the Previous Windows Installation to take up so much storage space on your computer, especially if you have less space in C: Drive.
 
Note: If you remove previous Windows installation files, you won’t be able to downgrade to previous version of Windows (which hopefully won’t be required).
