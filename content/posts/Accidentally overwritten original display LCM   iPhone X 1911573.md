Title: You Won't Believe How This User Completely Destroyed Their iPhone X's Original Display LCM - Shocking Mistake Revealed!

Introduction:
Apple has been releasing high-end smartphones year after year. One of them being the iPhone X, which was released in November 2017. With its advanced features and superb user experience, many users worldwide have upgraded to the iPhone X. However, no matter how advanced a smartphone may be, it is still prone to damage. In this article, we will discuss a particular incident where a user destroyed their iPhone X's original display LCM and what mistake led to it.

Body:
The iPhone X has a unique design that comes with a Super Retina OLED display having a resolution of 1125 x 2436 pixels. However, one user made a common mistake that led to the destruction of their iPhone X's original display LCM. The mistake was that the user did not use a screen protector on their iPhone X. As a result, the device's display was exposed to scratches and minor impacts, which ultimately led to the display's complete destruction.

LCM stands for Liquid Crystal Module. The LCM is responsible for the display's image quality and overall performance. If the LCM is damaged, as in this particular case, the display will not function correctly. Furthermore, the cost of replacing an iPhone X's LCM is relatively high, which means that the user had to go through significant expenses while fixing their device.

It is essential to realize that iPhone X's display is not made of ordinary glass. It is made of the most durable glass used in any smartphone. However, it does not mean that the display is immune to scratches or damage. Therefore, it would be best if you always used screen protectors to prevent any damage to your iPhone X's display.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the story of how a user destroyed their iPhone X's original display LCM is a reminder that no matter how advanced a smartphone may be, it still needs proper care and maintenance. The iPhone X's display is one of its most remarkable features, and it would be a shame to damage it due to neglect. So, whether you have an iPhone X or any other smartphone, be sure to use screen protectors to prevent any damage to your device's display. Remember, prevention is better than cure, and a small investment in a screen protector can save you thousands of dollars in the long run.

## Chosen Solution
 I screwed up today.
customer came in with a broken display and I replaced it with a new one. I accidentally overwrote his original display information with the replacement display. I have no true tone now. Is there a fix for this? I have JC PRO1000S for writing display data.

This is the report from JC repair. The data should exist on the device right?? It says QUERY LCM# failed

 You can use 3U tools to recover originaal screen serialnr. You can find this in in view verification report> screen serialnumber
