Have you experienced your Toshiba Satellite P55W hinge snapping, causing your screen to split in two? You are not alone! Many of these laptops have been breaking down due to faulty hinges, but we have some good news. In this article, we will explain what happened, how to avoid it, and what to do if you are already experiencing problems. 

What Happened?

The Toshiba Satellite P55W is a highly regarded laptop due to its lightweight and sleek design, including a 15.6-inch touch screen display. However, many users have experienced problems with the hinges, which hold the screen in place, causing it to break and split in two. 

The hinges of the laptop are made of plastic, which is not very durable and can easily crack or break. This leads to problems opening or closing the laptop, and over time, injuring the screen. It can eventually crack or break the laptop's screen, making the device unusable. 

Avoiding the Problem

Prevention is better than a cure, and in the case of the Toshiba Satellite P55W, it is better to be proactive than waiting for the problem to occur. Here are some measures you can take to prevent this problem from happening: 

1. Be gentle when opening and closing the laptop: Laptop hinges are not designed to withstand rough handling. Therefore, it's essential to handle them gently when opening or closing the laptop. 

2. Get a laptop stand: Laptops can be easily bumped or dropped when placed on a flat surface. Having a laptop stand not only improves ergonomic but also enhances the safety of your laptop. 

3. Regular Maintenance: Regular maintenance of your laptop hinge can help reduce the risk of having problems with your laptop. Cleaning your hinge with a soft cloth and a small amount of alcohol can prevent the accumulation of dirt that can block the hinge. 

What to Do if You Already Have a Broken Hinge

If your Toshiba Satellite P55W has already experienced a defective hinge resulting in a split screen, there is hope. You can take the following steps to address the issue: 

1. Contact Toshiba if it is still under warranty: Toshiba offers a standard 1-year warranty on the Toshiba Satellite P55W. If your laptop is still under warranty, you can contact them to get the hinges fixed. 

2. Take it to a professional: If your laptop is out of warranty, you can take it to a professional to fix the hinges. Some repair shops specialize in laptop hinge repairs and can help replace the faulty plating or fixing the hinges. 

Conclusion

The Toshiba Satellite P55W is a highly regarded laptop that provides its users with excellent features. However, its hinges have been found to become faulty and can result in a split screen. To prevent this issue, it's essential to handle the laptop gently, get a laptop stand and maintain it regularly.

## Chosen Solution
 I bought the Toshiba Satellite Radius P55W-B5112, that has a 360 hinge so it can go into tablet mode. The hinge broke within four months of owning it. I sent it to Toshiba. They said its my fault that the hinge quit after four months not their $@$*!& manufacturing. They also said that it would cost far to much money to replace the hinge and the back of the screen.
I've fixed a broken hinge before on a previous laptop so I'm not afraid of buying the parts and taking it apart. Last time I had a manual that I could follow and a youtube video, but I can't find anything.
I was wondering if anyone had solved a similar problem with this laptop and could give me advice? Also, some of the advice for other Toshiba hinges suggested using glue or adhesive. I was wondering if anyone knew if that would work on a 360 hinge? Seriously any advice on this models hinge would be appreciated.

 My wife's Toshiba Radius is showing the same symptoms. The screen is separating from the cover like the glue is failing.
This isn't the first problem she's had with it. The previous problem is that it would reboot unexpectedly and the touch pad stopped working altogether.

 I have the same problem.  But only after I got the screen replacement.  It refuses to stay together.  It will snap on and appear tight, but as soon as I open it, it comes apart.  Any suggestions??

 It took me a full nine months of fighting with Toshiba and lodging a complaint with the California Attorney General's Consumer Affairs office before Toshiba would honor its warranty. They replaced the computer finally.
