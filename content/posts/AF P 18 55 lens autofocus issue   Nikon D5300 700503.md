Title: Warning: Is Your Nikon D5300 AF-P 18-55 Lens Causing Focusing Havoc? Discover the Shocking Truth Now!

Introduction:
The Nikon D5300 is a highly popular camera that has garnered rave reviews for its excellent ergonomics, impressive image quality and superb features. However, the AF-P 18-55 lens that comes bundled with the camera has been causing a lot of frustration among users due to its erratic focusing behavior. In this article, we will explore the possible reasons why this lens might be causing focusing havoc, and we will also provide some solutions to help you get the most out of your Nikon D5300.

Body:
The Nikon D5300 AF-P 18-55 lens is a compact and lightweight lens that promises excellent image quality and fast focusing. However, many users have reported that the lens struggles to focus accurately and is often slow to lock focus. Some have even reported that the lens makes a lot of noise while attempting to focus, which can be very distracting.

One of the main reasons why the AF-P 18-55 lens might be causing focusing issues is due to the type of autofocus system that it uses. Unlike traditional autofocus systems that have a dedicated motor in the lens, this lens relies on the camera's autofocus motor to drive the focusing elements in the lens. This can lead to slower and less accurate focusing, especially in low light conditions.

Another possible reason why the AF-P 18-55 lens might be causing focusing issues is due to the lens design. This lens has a collapsible barrel design that makes it much smaller and lighter than other zoom lenses. However, this design also means that the lens has more moving parts, which can make it less stable and more prone to vibrations. These vibrations can cause the lens to struggle with focus accuracy, especially when shooting at slower shutter speeds.

Fortunately, there are a few solutions that can help you get the most out of your Nikon D5300 AF-P 18-55 lens. One solution is to use a tripod or other stabilizing device when shooting with this lens. This will help to reduce the amount of vibration that the lens experiences, which can lead to more accurate focusing.

Another solution is to switch to manual focus mode when shooting in low light conditions. While this can be more time-consuming than using autofocus, it can also be more accurate and reliable, especially if you are shooting stationary objects.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Nikon D5300 AF-P 18-55 lens can be a great addition to your camera kit. However, it is important to be aware of the focusing issues that this lens can cause, especially in low light conditions. By understanding the possible causes of these issues and implementing some solutions, you can unlock the full potential of your Nikon D5300 and its bundled lens.


## Chosen Solution
 The lens suddenly stopped auto focusing. What may be the issue ? The camera is autofocusing with other lens but not this one. I have tried to clean it and re attach it but the problem persists.

 There seems to be an issue in the lens, since you have said you had other lenses that work (assuming they are also AF-P).  Could see if the connectors are working correctly and are clean (check the cameraâ€™s as well).
Does the manual focus work at all?  The AF-P lenses use a fly-by-wire system for the manual focusing, so if that does work, then it is likely the camera and/or lens has manual focus set, and the lens is communicationg to and from the camera, and the focus motor is working.

 Same problem with my D5500 as well. It do not auto-focus
