# Revolutionary Infinix 5 with 5 Rear Cameras to Change How You Take Photos Forever!

Infinix, the Hong Kong-based smartphone manufacturer, has brought a new revolution in the mobile phone industry with its latest release – the Infinix 5, the phone with five rear cameras! Yes, you read that right. The Infinix 5 is equipped with five camera lenses on the rear, which promises to bring a new level of photography experience to its users.

Beyond the hype of the five cameras, the Infinix 5 offers a unique design identity with a 6.8-inch full HD Infinity-O display, slim bezels, and an under-display fingerprint scanner. The phone is available in Gradient Green and Midnight Black with a sleek 3D glass back cover, making it look like a luxury flagship device.

But let's talk about its most significant feature, the five cameras. The Infinix 5 is equipped with a 64MP primary sensor, 13MP ultra-wide-angle lens, 2MP depth sensor, 5MP macro lens, and another 2MP monochrome lens. Each sensor has a distinct role, be it wide-angle shots, close-up captures, portraits, or black and white photography.

The Infinix 5 boasts an improved camera application that provides plenty of options to customize your photography experience. You can go from a regular lens to wide-angle with a single click on the app. The camera application is easy to navigate, and its redesigned interface provides a seamless photography experience for users.

Apart from the hardware and software upgrades, the Infinix 5 reinforces a strong battery performance with its 4500mAh capacity for prolonged usage periods. Equipped with a 33W fast charger, the phone supports up to two hours of battery life on just a ten-minute charge.

The Infinix 5 runs on the latest version of XOS 7.6 based on Android 11. The XOS 7.6 features power optimization, AI-powered performance, gesture-based navigation, and a host of other features that enhance the user experience.

Finally, let's talk about the price. The Infinix 5 is a budget smartphone that promises decent value for money. It comes with a retail price of $259.99 only, and for that amount, the phone packs a punch to match its competitors. It's one of the most affordable phones with such camera specifications.

In conclusion, Infinix 5 delivers a significant leap in mobile phone photography, with its five-camera setup setting the gold standard. It serves as a forward-thinking phone that keeps pace with the latest trends in design, features, and performance. Anyone looking for an affordable phone with an excellent camera performance should consider buying the Infinix 5.

Infinix is still in high gear after teasing the Infinix S4. However, a rumour above a Penta camera Infinix phone has started spreading on the web like a wildfire. The company may be all geared up to launch its first Infinix 5 rear camera smartphone. However, the rumour didn’t catch the name of the mysterious devices with the camera count of the Nokia 9 Pure view.
 
Information about this Infinix 5 rear camera device is still scanty. The device is also said to be an all screen Infinix smartphone. How about the notch? Will it have a pop-up selfie camera? Or will it have the ZTE Nubia style dual screen?
 
We have seen Transsion Holdings brands pushing technologies to the midrange and affordable spectrum, but we are surprised by the camera count.

Is it time to level the ground between highend devices that have been flossing with multiple camera types like telephoto, monochrome and more? Will this device still be affordable? That is if it’s real anyways.
 
A statement from an Infinix Mobility official said in part: “One
thing is certain in the wake of this speculation, an Infinix smartphone is
coming soon and it will be a step in the right direction. With Infinix Mobility
willing to experiment with new features in a smartphone market that is in dire
need of some new ideas, 2019 might be the year for a technology like this to
actually be released”.
