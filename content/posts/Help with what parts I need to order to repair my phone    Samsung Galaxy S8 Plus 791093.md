## Chosen Solution
 I have dropped n cracked my galaxy s8+ s front glass. The touchscreen doesnt respond. I hooked up a otg mouse and the phone still functions perfect  and picture display, camera, fingerprint sensor etc. Is all in good shape. I need to know what i need to replace.  Are the front screen and touchscreen the same thing? What all would i need to make my touchscreen function properly again? Thanks .

 You will need to order a new screen assembly with frame. You will also need the adhesive for the rear cover for the phone. If you damage the rear cover taking it off you will need to replace it also. The back cover is extremely thin glass and easy to damage taking it off. The good part is it will pretty much stay in one piece because it's lined by a thin piece of flexible plastic. But it will put tiny pieces of glass all over your work area. If you decide to do this yourself, go to YouTube and watch every video on Samsung Galaxy s8 plus screen replacement video. Some are more explaining than others. You will need a heat gun or hair dryer to soften the adhesive and and a couple of business cards or playing cards to cut open the rear cover. You will need tweezers and a plastic spugger. You will need a small Phillips screwdriver and some jewelry glue to put in the vibration unit, you might not need this because the old one will probably have a enough tackiness left. You need to be very careful if you have to pull up cables that are glued down, you will want to heat them up and work slowly. These cables are extremely thin and tear easily. If after you watch the videos and don't think you can do it check around and find the ones with the best reputation. You don't want someone who does it for cheap and bad quality work. if you feel confident that you can do it then buy quality parts. There are multiple suppliers so if someone doesn't have the parts you are looking for look around. Ifixit should have everything as the phone is fairly new.
