Title: Is Your Samsung Tablet Killing Your Productivity? Find Out Why It Takes Almost A Day to Charge!

Introduction:

In today's digital world, tablets have become an essential gadget for many people. These devices provide portability, convenience, and can handle a wide range of activities from streaming videos and playing games to browsing the internet, reading books, and working. However, Samsung tablet users have been complaining about a common issue - slow charging. This problem affects the productivity of users as they have to wait for longer periods to access their devices fully. In this article, we will explore the reasons why Samsung tablets take almost a day to charge and what you can do to alleviate the problem.

Reasons for slow charging:

1. Outdated charging cable:

One of the main reasons why your Samsung tablet takes too long to charge could be due to an outdated charging cable. Over time, cables become worn out, resulting in low voltage and slow charging speeds. You may need to replace your cable with a new one capable of delivering enough current to charge the tablet quickly.

2. Using a low power charger:

Another contributing factor to slow charging is using a low-power charger. Although it may seem tempting to use a generic charger or a charger meant for other devices, such as your phone, this can affect the charging speed of your Samsung tablet. Instead, use a charger that comes with the tablet or a charger specifically designed for Samsung tablets.

3. Too many background applications:

Running too many applications in the background can cause your Samsung tablet to slow down, consequently affecting its charging speed. When charging your tablet, ensure that all unnecessary applications are closed to free up memory and CPU resources.

4. Overuse of the tablet:

Using your tablet for extended periods without giving it a break can also contribute to slow charging. Tablets generate heat, particularly when used for extended periods. Extended use can lead to overheating, which can affect the charging speed of the device.

What Can You Do to Alleviate the Problem?

1. Update your charger and cable:

To begin with, replace your charging cable with a new one that delivers enough current for fast charging. A charger with a power output of at least 2.4A is recommended for quick charging.

2. Charge your tablet in the right mode:

Samsung tablets come with two battery saving modes - Power saving mode and Ultra-power saving mode. Ensure your tablet is set to Power Saving mode when charging to reduce energy consumption and speed up charging.

3. Close all unnecessary applications:

Closing all unnecessary applications frees up memory and CPU resources, thus improving the charging speed of the device.

4. Give your tablet a break:

Avoid using your tablet for long periods, make sure you give it a break to prevent it from overheating. This will reduce the charging time when you need to juice up your device.

Conclusion:

Slow charging is a common problem that affects many Samsung tablet users. However, with the right charging cable and charger, a few setting tweaks, and mindful tablet use, you can effectively manage this problem. Take the time to care for your tablet, and you can enjoy uninterrupted productivity with extended battery life.

## Chosen Solution
 Why does my tablet take 20 hours to charge up

 Many tablets come with their own specific chargers and they have various voltage and amperage capabilities so that the tablet can charge at the set rate of that unit. Many people loose their charger and try charging their tablets using a charger with the same type of cable since many android tablets have the same type of connector for their charger as their android phones.
But do not be fooled using the correct charger specifically the one that came with the tablet is best for rapid charging of the tablet. Also using an over powered charger for lower powered systems can also change the life of the equipment specifically the battery life span.
So are you using the specific charger or charging cable for your unit?
