Fortunately, there are several solutions that you can try to fix Kernel Security Check Failure.\nIn this article, we will discuss five life-saving solutions that can help you fix Kernel Security Check Failure in minutes.\nSolution 1: Update Your Drivers The first solution you should try is to update all the drivers on your PC. Outdated drivers can cause Kernel Security Check Failure, so it’s essential to ensure that all your drivers are up to date. You can check your Windows Device Manager to see which drivers need updating.\nTo update your drivers, you can visit the manufacturer’s website and download the latest drivers. Alternatively, you can use a driver updater tool that will automatically find and install the latest drivers for you.\nSolution 2: Run System File Checker System File Checker is a built-in Windows tool that scans your system for corrupt system files and replaces them with new ones. If you’re experiencing Kernel Security Check Failure, running System File Checker can help fix the issue.\nTo run System File Checker, follow these steps:\nClick on Start and type “cmd” in the search bar Right-click on Command Prompt and select “Run as administrator” Type “sfc /scannow” and press Enter Wait for the system scan to complete If System File Checker finds any corrupt system files, it will replace them with new ones. Once the scan is complete, restart your PC and check if the issue is resolved.\nSolution 3: Disable Overclocking Overclocking is the process of forcing your PC’s components to run faster than their factory settings. While overclocking can improve performance, it can also cause Kernel Security Check Failure.\nIf you’re experiencing this issue and have overclocked your PC, you should disable it to see if it fixes the problem. To disable overclocking, you can access your PC’s BIOS settings and reset them to the default settings.\nSolution 4: Perform a Malware Scan Malware infection can also cause Kernel Security Check Failure.

The Kernel Security Check Failure error depicts that some important system files or components failed integrity or compatibility check. The easiest way around it is to replace or update these files or components.\nWhat causes the Kernel Security Check Failure? When troubleshooting an error, it is critical to have a clear understanding of the factors that caused it. Because of this, we have highlighted some of the most prevalent causes that might trigger a Kernel Security Check Failure error:\nSystem files that have been corrupted – Even Microsoft makes mistakes from time to time, releasing flawed upgrades that cause the system to crash without the user’s knowledge or approval. Hardware that is incompatible with or malfunctioning – A stop code can be generated by unseated hard drives, RAM chips, or unsecured connectors. Check that all hardware components are securely fastened, especially if your computer was recently opened. To be on the safe side, unplug and then reseat all of these components. Drivers that are out of date or unsuitable – Oftentimes, old or incompatible program files or device drivers might cause intermittent BSOD STOP errors.
