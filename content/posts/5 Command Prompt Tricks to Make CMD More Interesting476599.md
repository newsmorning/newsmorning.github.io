Unleash the Power of Your Command Prompt: 5 Surprising Tricks to Spice Up Your CMD Game!

As a computer user, you’ve probably used the command prompt, also known as CMD, at some point in your life. But do you really know the power of this tool? Most users only scratch the surface of what the command prompt can do, and that’s a shame. With a few tricks up your sleeve, you can unleash the full power of your CMD and take your game to the next level. Here are 5 surprising tricks to spice up your CMD game!

1. Customizing Your Prompt

The default prompt in CMD is functional, but let’s face it, it’s boring. Fortunately, you can customize it to your liking. By using the command prompt, you can modify the colors of your prompt text and background, add time and date stamps, and even include information such as your computer name or username. Here’s how you can customize your prompt:

- Open CMD
- Type “prompt” followed by “/?” for a list of available options
- Experiment with various parameters until you find your perfect prompt

2. Using Aliases

Do you find yourself frequently typing long, complex commands? Save yourself some time with aliases. An alias is a shorthand for a longer command. For example, you can create an alias that replaces “cd C:\Users\username\documents” with a simple command like “mydocs”. Here’s how you can create an alias:

- Open CMD
- Type “doskey [alias name]=[command]”
- Press enter
- Your alias is now saved

You can also view your saved aliases by typing “doskey /macros” in CMD.

3. Running Multiple Commands at Once

Often, you need to run several commands in order to accomplish a task. Instead of typing each command separately, you can string them together and execute them all at once. You can do this with the “&” symbol, which separates commands. For example, you can open Notepad, change to a specific directory, and create a new text file in one line:

- Open CMD
- Type “notepad & cd C:\Users\username\documents & type NUL > file.txt"
- Press enter

The “&” symbol tells CMD to execute each command in turn.

4. Using Keyboard Shortcuts

If you’re a fan of keyboard shortcuts, you’ll love this CMD trick. Use the “F7” key to bring up a list of previously executed commands. You can then use the arrow keys to select a command from the list and execute it. This is a great time-saver if you frequently use certain commands.

5. Accessing Hidden Commands

CMD is full of hidden gems that aren’t immediately apparent. These commands can be accessed by typing “help” followed by a command name. This will bring up a list of available options for that command. Here are some useful hidden commands to get you started:

- Ipconfig – Displays information about your computer’s network connections
- Sfc – Scans for and repairs corrupt system files
- Netstat – Displays active network connections and their associated processes

By leveraging these hidden commands, you can unlock even more power from your CMD.

In Conclusion

Now that you know these 5 surprising tricks, go forth and unleash the full power of your command prompt! With a little curiosity and a willingness to experiment, you can take your CMD game to the next level. So go ahead, customize your prompt, create aliases, run multiple commands at once, use keyboard shortcuts, access hidden commands, and become a command prompt master!

Command Prompt is an indispensable part of Windows. From generating a list of startup programs to finding your WiFi password, there’s a lot you can do with the Command Prompt. However, you may not know that the Command Prompt can also be fun. All you need is to know a few Command Prompt tricks to make it more interesting. 
 
In this article, we’ll give you a few interesting command prompt ideas that’ll change the way you look at the Command Prompt for good. There are other standard commands that all Windows users should know.
 
## How to Launch the Command Prompt?
 
Before you can use any Command Prompt tricks, you’ll need to launch it. Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
 

 
## 1. Change the Command Prompt Window Color
 
The Command Prompt’s black-only look can feel bland. However, you can add some vibrance to the window with just a few clicks. You can change the colors for text as well as the background.
 
- Right-click on the Command Prompt window’s title bar and select Properties.

 
- Switch to the Colors tab in the Properties window.

 
- You can change colors for screen text or background and popup text or background from the Colors tab.

 
Popup text and background refer to the text and background colors you see on a popup Command Prompt window. For instance, this is what the popup looks like when you press F7 to view the command-line history:
 
Once you’re in the Colors tab, you can choose one of the colors from the presets, or if you want, you can adjust the Selected Color Values. 
 
If you prefer, you can adjust the opacity of the text or background. 
 
As you make these changes, you’ll see them in the preview box. Select OK to apply the changes once you’re satisfied with the colors you see in the preview.
 
## 2. Customize the Prompt Text
 
The Command Prompt displays the directory you’re currently working in. The default prompt text is helpful but boring. Fortunately, you can customize the prompt text to whatever you want. For this, you’ll need to run a simple command. 
 
- Once you’ve launched the command prompt, run the following command:

 
prompt “prompt text”$G
 
Replace the words “prompt text” with the text you want to see in your Command Prompt.
 
The $G in this command ensures that there’s a greater than sign (“>”) at the end of the prompt. If you want a different character, type in the following command, and you’ll get a list of options:
 
help prompt
 
## 3. Change the Title of the Command Prompt Window 
 
The Command Prompt window’s default title is “Command Prompt”, or “Administrator: Command Prompt” when you run it as an administrator. The monotony isn’t usually an issue unless you’re working with multiple windows. 
 
If you’re getting a little dizzy finding the right Command Prompt window from about a dozen that you’re running, you can give each of them a different title. All you need to do is run the following command:
 
title TaskName
 
Replace TaskName with whatever task you’re running in a particular Command Prompt window. 
 
Note that once you exit Command Prompt and launch it again, you’ll once again see the default title.
 
## 4. Watch Star Wars in ASCII With Command Prompt
 
You can watch Star Wars old-school style, thanks to telnet services. You can do much more than watch Star Wars with telnet, though, like playing role-playing games like Ateraan.
 
To watch Star Wars in Command Prompt, you’ll first need to make sure that Telnet is enabled on your PC. If it’s not, running a telnet command will give you an error. Command Prompt will tell you that it doesn’t recognize the command as an internal or external command.
 
To see if Telnet is enabled, start by searching for Turn Windows features on or off in the Start Menu and select the Best match. Search the list of Windows features for Telnet Client. If the box next to it isn’t checked, check it and select OK.
 
Once Telnet is enabled, launch the Command Prompt and run the following command:
 
telnet.towel.blinkenlights.nl
 
With Telnet, you can also do some other cool stuff. For instance, you can play games or have fun with the “Bastard Operator from Hell”. Here are the games you can play and the commands you’d need to run for playing them:
 
- New Worlds-Ateraan: telnet ateraan.com 4002Achaea: telnet achaea.com 23Avalon – The Legend Lives: telnet avalon-rpg.com 23Free Chess: telnet freechess.org 5000Legend of the Red Dragon: telnet lord.stabs.org 123BatMUD: telnet batmud.bat.org 23Aardwolf: telnet aardmud.org 4000

 
You can also kill some time with the “Bastard Operator from Hell” with this command:
 
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl 666
 
Or, you can check the weather with Weather Underground by executing the following command:
 
telnet rainmaker.wunderground.com
 
## Generate a Battery Health Report
 
Windows maintains all the information you need about your battery’s health. Thanks to this, you can generate a full battery report using the Command Prompt. The report will give you battery stats like full capacity, current capacity, and factory specs. 
 
However, to generate a battery report, you’ll need to run CMD as an administrator. Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to run Command Prompt as an administrator.
 
- Once you’ve launched Command Prompt, run the following command:

 
Powercfg /energy
 
- When the report is ready, you’ll be able to access it in the System32 directory. It’s saved as an HTML, so you can paste the following address in your browser’s URL bar to access the report:

 
C:\Windows\System32\energy-report.html
 
## The Not-So-Boring Command Prompt
 
A lot of people view the command prompt as a black box reserved for savvy Windows users. However, it’s not that difficult for a beginner to get comfortable with the Command Prompt. If you forget a command every once in a while, you can always turn on auto-complete on Command Prompt. Plus, it’s not all that boring if you know a few Command Prompt tricks, is it?
