Disable Antivirus for sometime
 
Alter Direct X Settings

The Integrity of the game files must be verified
 
Update Drivers
 
### Option 1: Disable Antivirus For Sometime
 
Antivirus software is very suspicious of programs and controls a lot of activities on your system. Not only can they prevent malicious activities in your computer but also detect those programs that hog your resources. Most of the games played with Steam do consume many resources and can be blocked by your Antivirus unless you add an exception for it.
 
Before you add your game as an exception, let us confirm that the Antivirus is the cause of the Grounded game crashing on Windows 10 PC by temporarily disabling it. Once you do that, relaunch Steam and then Grounded Game and check if you face any issues with PC crashes while gaming.
 
Note: Do not open your email or visit any other website while your Antivirus is disabled. If the Grounded Game runs with no issues, then we have identified the problem. Just add an exception in your Antivirus for this game.
 
### Option 2: Alter Direct X Settings
 
### 
 
Microsoft Direct X is a small programming code which helps users to run large applications like games or photo editing software on your computer. It is used on all Microsoft OS and is considered a part of the system files. The latest version is Direct X 12, which surprisingly does not support Grounded Game and can cause PC crashes while gaming. The simple resolution is to force the system to use Direct X 11 while playing the game. The steps for this are:
 
Step 1: Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box and type dxdiag in the text box and click on OK.
 
Step 2: Here, you can check the Direct X version installed on your computer.
 
Step 3: Now, open the Steam interface and locate and select the Library Tab.
 
Step 4: Scan all the games and choose Grounded by making a right-click on it.
 
Step 5: Click on Properties on the Context menu and then click on the General tab in the new window.
 
Step 6: Locate and click on Set launch options. Here you must type -dxlevel 110 in the empty field and press enter.
 
Step 7: Now click on the Close button and restart your computer.
 
Step 8: Relaunch Steam and then Grounded Game to check if the game is crashing on Windows 10 PC
 
### Option 3: The Integrity Of The Game Files Must Be Verified
 
Although Steam enables the users to play via its interface and be online, many game files must be installed on the local machine or your computer. If these files are tampered with or are corrupted for any reason, you will face a Grounded game crashing on the PC issue. To fix this, you can let the Steam interface check for missing or corrupted files and repair them. Here are the steps to initiate this:
 
Step 1: Open Steam interface and select the Library tab from the top.
Step 2: Next, scroll the list until you see Grounded in the list of games. Make a right-click on it and click on properties.
 
Step 3: Finally, click on the local files tab and locate the option labeled as Verify integrity.
 
Step 4: Click on the Verify button and wait until the process completes.
 
Restart the computer and launch steam and then Grounded game to check if you face any issues with PC crashes while gaming.
 
### Option 4: Play As A Single-Player In Offline Mode
 
Grounded game can be played in both Multiplayer and Single Player modes. Although it is more fun to play with friends if you face the Grounded Game Crashing on Windows 10 PC, it is recommended to try in a single-mode player first and that too offline. Here are the steps to achieve this.
Step 1: Open Steam and select Settings.
 
Step 2: Next, click on Go Offline.
 
Step 3: Restart in Offline Mode.
 
Step 4: Finally, open the steam interface and play the game to check if you face any issues with PC crashes while gaming
 
### Option 5: Update Drivers
 
The final resolution to fix Grounded Game Crashing on Windows 10 PC is to update your drivers. Drivers are tiny programs written in machine languages to communicate between the Operating system and the Hardware. They act as a sort of translator between them. It is essential to update the drivers as the options visible to you on Graphical User Interface can only be activated if the driver communicates the appropriate instructions to the hardware. There are two methods to update drivers on your computer:
 
### Method 1: Use The Device Manager To Update Your Drivers
 
The Device Manager is a system tool in Windows Operating System that helps to update the outdated drivers. The Device Manager reaches out to the Microsoft Server and other trusted sources for the drivers’ updated version and installs them. However, it cannot search past that to other OEM servers, which implies that you will not get the most recent driver for your hardware. But it is definitely worth the try by following these steps:
 
Step 1: Press and hold Windows + R to launch the RUN box and type “devmgmt.msc” in the text box.
 
Step 2: Next, click on the OK button, and the Device Manager box will open.
 
Step 3: Locate display adapter and double click on it to view the dropdown options.
 
Step 4: Right-click on your graphics card and select Update drive from the contextual menu.
 
Step 5:Carry out the on-screen instructions and click on the positive responses.
 
The Device Manager will scan the computer for hardware variations and then search for the appropriate drivers. It will also download and install the updated and most compatible driver on your computer.
 
### Method 2: Use A Driver Updater Application to update Your Drivers.
 
The easier way to update the Drivers is to install a Driver Updater Software. Suchprograms are developed to check your computer for corrupted, missing, andoutdated drivers and update them with a few clicks. Many such software presents can help update drivers, but the best of them is Smart Driver Care, which I have been using for a whole year now.This process has two significant benefits:
 
All drivers updated:
 
Updates all drivers to the latest version and ensures the smooth functioning of the system.
 
Convenient to use interface: 
 
Automatically updates the drivers with a few clicks and, at the same time, does not require any user input regarding the model number and version of the hardware installed.
 
Maintaining your drivers by updating them regularly results in a faster PC with improved performance. This is probably because of the daily updated drivers can convenientlyconnect with the hardware, and smoothcommunication is established.  The Smart Driver Care scans all computer drivers and thenlocates the updated version from the third party OEM websites. Here are the steps on how this App works:
 
Step 1: Download the Smart Driver Care.
 
Step 2:Make a double click on the executable file downloaded and carry out the on-screen instructions to install the program.
 
Step 3: Open the software via the shortcut available on the desktop and complete the registration process to continue.
 
Step 4:Next, click on the Start Scan button and let the software check your computer formissing, outdated, and corrupt drivers.
 
Step 5: Click on Update All to update and replace all drivers, including Graphics Drivers.
