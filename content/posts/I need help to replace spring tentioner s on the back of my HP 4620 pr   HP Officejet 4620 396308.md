Is Your HP Printer on the Verge of a Major Breakdown? Learn How to Replace Spring Tensioner S in the Back of HP Officejet 4620!

When you are printing a crucial document, and your printer malfunctions, it can be frustrating, especially when you have tried everything in your power to get it working again. This issue is more common than you think, and one of the culprits behind it is a faulty spring tensioner in the back of your HP Officejet 4620 printer. 

A spring tensioner is a critical component in the printer's paper feeding mechanism. It ensures that the paper is fed into the machine correctly and helps to maintain the printer's overall efficiency. If a spring tensioner is malfunctioning, it can cause the printer to malfunction or fail altogether. Luckily, replacing the spring tensioner is a relatively easy task that can be done in a matter of minutes with the right tools and instructions. 

Here's what you need to do to replace the spring tensioner in the back of your HP Officejet 4620:

Step 1: Turn off the Printer

Before you get started with the replacement process, make sure to turn off the printer and unplug it from the wall outlet. This step is crucial for your safety as well as to prevent any damage to the printer during the process.

Step 2: Remove the Back Cover

Once the printer is turned off, remove the back cover of the machine. You can do this by gently sliding the cover towards the bottom of the printer, then lifting it off.

Step 3: Locate the Spring Tensioner S

Inside the printer, you will find the spring tensioner S located on the right side of the paper feed mechanism. It is black and made of plastic, so it's hard to miss.

Step 4: Remove the Old Tensioner

To remove the old tensioner, use your fingers to release the small tabs that hold it in place. Once the tensioner is free, use a pair of pliers to gently pull it out of the printer.

Step 5: Install the New Tensioner

Insert the new spring tensioner into the plastic slots, making sure that it is correctly aligned. Once it's in place, use your fingers to snap the tabs back into position.

Step 6: Reassemble the Printer

With the new spring tensioner in place, it's time to put the back cover back on the printer. To do this, slide the cover back onto the printer, and click it into place.

Step 7: Test the Printer

Plug the printer back into the wall outlet and turn it on. Test the printer by printing a test page to ensure that it is working correctly.

Final Thoughts

Replacing a spring tensioner in the back of your HP Officejet 4620 printer is a simple process, but if you're not confident or comfortable doing it yourself, seek professional help. Neglecting to replace a faulty spring tensioner could result in a severe malfunction or cause the printer to stop working entirely. By following these simple steps, you can help ensure that your printer stays in good working condition for a long time.

 Hi,
Not sure which springs you’re referring to, but here’s a teardown video of the printer.
At 2:58 minutes into the video the two printhead tension springs are seen being removed by using a tool with a hook
At 7:36 minutes, one carriage unit spring clip is being removed. There may be one on the other end of the carriage.
At 11.57 minutes the feed roller spring is shown.
Hopefully this will help you to replace the springs.
