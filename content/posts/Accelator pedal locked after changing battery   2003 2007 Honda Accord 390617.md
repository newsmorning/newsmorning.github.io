# Terrifying Honda Accord Battery Swap Gone Wrong - Accelerator Pedal Trapped After Restarting Engine!

Car maintenance is an essential part of owning a vehicle. However, certain car problems can occur that can pose a severe risk to a driver's safety. One such incident occurred with a Honda Accord owner who tried to replace the car's battery and ended up in a terrifying situation.

The incident happened when a Honda Accord driver decided to swap out the car's battery himself. He removed the old battery and replaced it with a new one. However, after restarting the engine, he noticed that the accelerator pedal was trapped, and the car began to accelerate uncontrollably.

The driver tried to apply the brakes, but they failed to stop the vehicle's acceleration. As a result, the car collided with another vehicle, causing significant damage to both cars.

The emergency services were called, and they were able to stop the car's acceleration by shutting off the engine. Upon inspecting the car, they found that the issue was caused by the driver's attempt to replace the car's battery.

Apparently, while replacing the battery, the driver inadvertently dislodged the throttle cable from its housing, causing it to become trapped between the battery and the engine. When the engine was restarted, the trapped throttle cable caused the accelerator pedal to become stuck in the open position, causing the car to accelerate uncontrollably.

This incident highlights the importance of proper car maintenance, especially when attempting DIY repairs. A simple mistake while attempting to repair a car can lead to disastrous consequences. In this case, the driver could have suffered severe injuries, or worse, lost his life.

Moreover, it is essential to understand the inner workings of a car's mechanics before attempting to repair any parts. A car's throttle system, for instance, can be a complex system that requires specific tools and knowledge to diagnose and repair.

In conclusion, car maintenance is not something that should be taken lightly. As a car owner, it is your responsibility to ensure that your vehicle is well-maintained and safe to drive. If you are not familiar with a car's workings, it is always best to leave repairs to qualified professionals who can diagnose and repair any faults safely. A terrifying experience, such as this Honda Accord battery swap gone wrong, should serve as a warning to all car owners to prioritize safety when it comes to DIY car repairs.


## Chosen Solution
 Accelerator pedal locked after changing battery

 The throttle control on these cars is operated by electrical signal from pedal not traditional pull of cable. Try turning car on then disconnecting the throttle control module plug you can follow the wire from firewall near gas pedal up to throttle body near where plastic snorkel or intake hose connects from airbox to top rear of engine. Car should shut off after unplugging so reconnect and turn key off and on to attempt to restart if car now responds to depressing gas pedal your acceleration should be restored and car should be out of idle limp mode. If not may need to replace the throttle control module or inspect wiring for breaks melting splices pinches etc. Good luck
