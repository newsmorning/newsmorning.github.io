Dell’s CES 2017 exhibit has already featured a great number of PCs, the majority of which are gaming focused. The PC maker has unveiled four new PCs within its Inspiron and Alienware lines of products.
 
First off, Dell unveiled the new Inspiron 14 7000 and Inspiron 15 7000 gaming laptops running Windows 10. With a 1-inch thickness, the Inspiron laptops pack a punch under the hood. Both PCs are powered by either a 7th generation Intel Core i5 processor or an i7 processor, coupled with 4GB of RAM and NVIDIA’s GRX 1050 and 1050Ti graphics cards.
 
Intel’s latest H-series quad-core mobile CPUs are particularly power intensive, so Dell improved the heating systems in both machines. The Inspiron 14 7000 and Inspiron 15 7000 laptops have heat exchangers connected to dual cooling fans with a high-efficiency blade pitch by a large piping system.
 
Both PCs also include up to 1TB of HDDs and a dual-drive M.2 128GB option configured to a 1TB HDD. The Inspiron 15 boasts a 4K Ultra HD display out of the box while the Inspiron 14 has fewer pixels at just 1080p.
 
Dell also introduced new Alienware 13, 15, and 17 models. The 13.3-inch Alienware 13 is the first virtual reality-ready notebook that packs beefy hardware such as the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060. Both the Alienware 15 and Alienware 17 run on Nvidia’s 10 series GeForce graphics chips and are powered by Intel’s Core i7 processors. The Alienware models also have thicker chassis than the Dell Inspiron 15 7000.
 
As usual with Dell’s products, you can customize the memory, storage, and power features for the new Alienware computers. The Alienware 13 will be available to buy for $999, Alienware 15 for $1,199, and Alienware 17 for $1,299. The Inspiron 7000 PCs can be had for $799. The computers will ship with Windows 10 out of the box to U.S. consumers.
