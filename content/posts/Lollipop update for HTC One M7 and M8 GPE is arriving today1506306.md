Revamp Your HTC One M7/M8 with the Sweetest Lollipop Update – Out NOW!

HTC One M7/M8 owners out there, it's time to celebrate because the sweetest update has just arrived! The long-awaited Android Lollipop 5.0 update is now available for your HTC One M7/M8. This update doesn't only bring new features and improvements, but it also revamps the overall look and performance of your phone.

So, why should you update?

Firstly, the new update brings a fresh and sleek design to your phone. The Material Design, which was introduced in Android Lollipop, gives a modern and polished look to the user interface. Colors are brighter and more vibrant, with an emphasis on transparency and layering. The notification panel is now easier to use, allowing you to access your favorite settings and notifications with just a swipe down.

Secondly, the new update brings improved performance and speed to your phone. The ART (Android RunTime) runtime has replaced the old Dalvik runtime, which means apps launch faster and run smoother. The battery life has also improved, thanks to a new battery saver mode that helps extend the life of your phone's battery.

Moreover, the update introduces new features such as Smart Lock, which allows you to keep your phone unlocked in trusted locations or near trusted devices. The updated multitasking feature, also known as the Recent Apps screen, allows you to see all your recently used apps and switch between them seamlessly.

Other improvements include enhanced security, new animation effects, and a revamped camera app. The camera app now has a new UI that makes it easier to switch between camera modes and settings.

So, how can you update your phone?

To update your HTC One M7/M8, go to your phone's settings, select the "About" option, and then select "Software updates." Your phone will automatically search for updates, and if a new version is available, you will be prompted to download and install it.

It's important to note that before downloading the update, make sure you have enough battery life and backup your files and data to avoid losing any important files. Also, the update file size is large, so make sure you have a stable internet connection to avoid any interruptions during the download and installation process.

In conclusion, the Android Lollipop update is a game-changer for your HTC One M7/M8. It revamps the look and performance of your phone, bringing new features and enhancements. So, don't hesitate and update your phone now to enjoy the sweetest Lollipop experience!

A couple of weeks before, Mo Versi, HTC’s product VP announced that the Google Play Editions of HTC One M7 and M8 would get the lollipop that very soon, but immediately after he again announced that the update has been delayed due to some reasons. The users had to wait more for the update, and Mo has announced that the Lollipop update for HTC One M7 and M8 GPE is arriving today, i.e. 5th of December. In addition to the surprise, the update is the latest version even of the Lollipop, which is LRX22C build based on Android 5.0.1.
 

 
HTC thus, skipped the 5.0 Lollipop update for the HTC One M7 and M8 GPE phones, and jumped direct to the 5.0.1 Lollipop from 4.4.4 KitKat. This makes the GPE One series users one of the luckiest to have the latest version, as the 5.0.1 update version is currently only seeded for some of the Nexus devices by Google. The skip is most probably due to the bugs which are showing up on the devices which are updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and the 5.0.1 is a bug fix version of the same.
 
You can flash the files manually (if you are not patient enough to wait for the OTA notifications) by downloading from the links below:
 
- HTC One M7 GPE 5.0.1 Lollipop
 - HTC One M8 GPE 5.0.1 Lollipop

 
If you are using either of the devices, you may have probably got a notification for Over the Air update by now, or you can check it simply by going to Settings >> About phone >> System updates. The update files for both the phones are slightly more than 500 MB. HTC had promised to provide the update for the One series smartphone within 90 days of getting the source code, and we hope the update for non-GPE One series smartphones is on its way.
