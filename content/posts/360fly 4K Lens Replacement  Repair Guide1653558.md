Stop Wasting Money on Expensive GoPro Repairs - Fix Your 360Fly 4K Camera Lens At Home with This Comprehensive Repair Guide!

GoPro cameras are known for their durability and high-quality image capturing capabilities. However, accidents do happen, and sometimes, the lens of the camera may become damaged. The cost of repairing a GoPro camera can be quite expensive. Fortunately, if you own a 360Fly 4K camera, you can fix the lens at home with this comprehensive repair guide.

Tools Required:
- Tweezers
- Screwdriver
- Heat gun or hairdryer
- Rubbing alcohol
- Lens cleaner cloth
- Epoxy glue

Step 1: Remove the Camera Lens

To remove the damaged camera lens, you’ll need to remove the front cover of the camera first. Using a screwdriver or other appropriate tool, remove the screws located on the outer rim of the cover. Then gently lift the cover off the camera.

Next, remove the four screws holding the lens in place. Once you have removed the screws, carefully lift the lens out of the socket. Be sure to do this gently so you don't damage any of the other components of the camera.

Step 2: Clean the Lens

Once the camera lens is removed, use a lens cleaner cloth to clean any dirt, dust or smudges from the lens gently. If you’re unable to get the lens clean, use a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the cloth to remove the dirt and smudges. Be sure to wait for the rubbing alcohol to dry before proceeding to the next step.

Step 3: Fix the Lens

Examine the lens carefully to determine if there are any cracks or chips. If the lens is broken, you will need to replace it with a new one. If the lens is only slightly damaged, you can use a heat gun or hairdryer to soften the epoxy glue and reshape the lens.

Apply a small amount of epoxy glue to the affected area of the lens. Use a toothpick or small brush to spread the glue evenly. After applying the glue, use a heat gun or hairdryer to soften the glue and reshape the lens if necessary. Be sure to follow the epoxy glue manufacturer’s instructions to ensure that the glue dries correctly.

Step 4: Reattach the Lens

Once the glue has dried, you will need to reattach the lens to the camera. Carefully place the lens into the socket and replace the four screws that were holding it in place. Once the lens is securely attached, replace the front cover by screwing it back into place.

Conclusion

The 360Fly 4K camera is a great alternative to the more expensive GoPro cameras, but accidents can happen. If your camera lens becomes damaged, don’t waste money on an expensive repair. With a few simple tools and this comprehensive repair guide, you can fix the camera lens at home. Remember to take your time and be patient during the repair process, ensuring that you don’t accidentally damage any other parts of the camera. Good Luck!
