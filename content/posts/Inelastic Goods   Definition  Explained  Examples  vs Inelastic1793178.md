Is Your Wallet Ready for the Truth about Inelastic Goods?

As consumers, we are constantly faced with various goods and services to choose from, all of which have different prices and relative importance in our lives. However, not all goods are created equal, and some are more sensitive to changes in price and income than others. This is where the concept of inelastic goods comes in.

Inelastic goods are those that have a relatively constant demand despite changes in price, income, or other economic factors. This means that consumers are willing to pay a higher price for these goods, as they are perceived as essential or vital for daily living.

Examples of inelastic goods include basic necessities, such as food, water, housing, and healthcare. These are goods that we cannot live without, and consumers are willing to pay a higher price for them, regardless of their income level. Other examples include addictive substances, like cigarettes or alcohol, and luxury goods, such as high-end fashion and jewelry.

One key difference between inelastic and elastic goods is the degree to which consumers are willing to change their behavior in response to changes in price. Elastic goods are those that have a more variable demand, as consumers are more likely to switch to substitutes or reduce their consumption when prices rise. In contrast, inelastic goods are less likely to be affected by changes in price, as consumers cannot easily substitute them with comparable alternatives.

Understanding the concept of inelastic goods is important for both consumers and businesses. For businesses, it means that they may have more pricing power with inelastic goods, as consumers are more willing to pay a higher price for these goods. It also highlights the importance of maintaining a steady supply of inelastic goods, as they are less likely to be affected by changes in economic conditions.

For consumers, understanding the concept of inelastic goods can help them make more informed purchasing decisions. They can identify which goods are essential and prioritize their spending accordingly. It can also help them anticipate price changes and adjust their budgets accordingly.

In conclusion, inelastic goods are an important concept in economics and have significant implications for both consumers and businesses. By understanding the difference between inelastic and elastic goods, consumers can make more informed decisions about their spending, while businesses can better understand how to price and supply their goods. So, is your wallet ready for the truth about inelastic goods? Only you can decide.

## Inelastic Goods Definition
 
Inelastic goods do not alter consumer buying behavior and do not follow the law of demand. Hence, the price elasticity of demand for such goods will be less than one, and the demand curve will be steep. Examples of inelastic goods include food, water, medicines, etc. 
 

 
### 
Key Takeaways

 
- Inelastic goods display a unique feature where their demand doesn’t vary much with the price changes. That is, slight variations in demand do exist, but the rate of variation of price and demand will not be the same.If price changes do not alter the demand levels, the product is perfectly inelastic. It means that the product is completely unaffected by the price.The difference between elastic and inelastic goods is that the demand for the former changes significantly even with a small price change.

Inelastic goods are commodities whose demand doesn’t alter with an increase or decrease in price. Unlike most goods, it does not follow the law of demand, which states that the demand for a product varies inversely with its price.
 
Because of this, the demand curve for these goods is steep, which shows the absence of a relation between price and demand. Inelastic commodities are identified by considering an x% change in their price. If the change in demand is less than x%, the good is inelastic. If it is more than x%, the good is elastic. 
 
For example, consider a company PQR, which launches a new version of car X. The original version was priced at $1000, and the company could sell 500 units monthly. The latest version has some advanced features. Therefore, the company plans to sell at $1300. PQR predicts that the sales for the first month should be around 400 units. 
 
Here, the increase in price is 30% (x= 30%).
 
The forecasted decrease in demand is 20%.
 
Since the 20% decrease in demand is less than the 30% increase in price, the car is inelastic. 
 
But once the product was launched, the company could only sell 340 units (68% of the original numbers sold). Therefore, since a 32% decrease in demand is more than the 30% increase in price, the car has become elastic. 
 
Total revenue with original version = $1000 x 500 = $500,000
 
Gross expected revenue with new version = $1300 x 400 = $520,000
 
Total revenue with new version = $1300 x 340 = $442,000
 
Therefore, the company did not reach its target. Instead, the revenue became lesser than before. As a result, it might have even made a loss.
 
Considering the case where the company could sell 500 units of the new version, the price change wouldn’t have affected the demand. That is, the car would have been perfectly inelastic. 
 
Perfectly inelastic goods show no variation in demand with price changes. Therefore, the demand curve of such items is a vertical line. However, perfectly inelastic goods do not exist in reality. But essential commodities like water and air are almost perfectly inelastic. Hence, even if the price becomes exorbitant, people need them for survival.
 
### Example
 
Let’s look at a real-life example of inelastic goods to clarify the concept. 
 
The falling oil and gas prices in the United States caused a concern among many in the country when they dropped by 22% on June 22. However, some investors are optimistic and predict that the price will increase, while others speculate that the price will decrease, fueled by the economic recession. 
 
But some argue that the price will not affect the gasoline demand, as it is inelastic. However, when the rising gasoline prices cause the cost of food, electricity, etc., to go up, people might choose to drive less. Then, gasoline might become an elastic good.
 
Elastic goods are those commodities, the demand for which changes with the price variations. Therefore, if the price increases, the demand will decrease and vice-versa. 
 
### Elastic vs. Inelastic Goods
 
Here are the main differences between elastic and inelastic goods
 
The price elasticity of demand (ep) can be given as:
 
                                   Change in demand/ Actual demand
 
Price elasticity = ———————————————————
 
                                         Change in price/ Actual price
 
When ep> 1 for a product, it is elastic,
 
whenep< 1, the product is inelastic,
 
whenep = 1, demand for the product varies proportionately with the price.

Inelastic commodities are those whose demand doesn’t vary much with price changes, whereas the demand for elastic goods varies greatly even with a small fluctuation in price.
 
No. It need not always be the case. Inelasticity can happen when a product’s price goes up and down. Therefore, expensive goods being inelastic is only one case. For instance, consider a luxury car brand that manufactures a model worth $5 million and increases it to $5.25 million. The people who buy the car when it costs $5 million would still buy it anyway. Similarly, the other case is when the price of a product decreases, but its demand remains the same.
 
No. There is no solid basis for labeling inelastic goods as inferior. Firstly, luxury goods too can be inelastic. Secondly, there is no relation between inelasticity and inferiority. However, inferior commodities can be elastic. When the price of such goods rises, the demand decreases, as customers can buy quality products for the same price.
