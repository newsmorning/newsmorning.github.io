Title: Is Your iMac Acting Up? Shocking Reason Why A1312 Won't Turn On Revealed - GPU LED 1 Present!

If you're an iMac user, then you know how frustrating it can be when your device suddenly stops working. And when it comes to the A1312 model, one of the most common issues is the inability to turn on. However, this is not just a random occurrence but is, in fact, related to the GPU. 

The A1312 model, which was introduced by Apple in 2011, features a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) that allows for high-quality display and graphics. However, the design of the device also presents some issues, specifically with the GPU.

The problem comes from overheating, which can cause the GPU to become loose or malfunction. This often results in the dreaded "GPU LED 1 Present" error message on the device. When this error message appears, the iMac will not turn on, leaving users at a loss for what to do.

So, what can be done about this issue? Your best bet would be to take your iMac to an Apple repair center. They have the expertise and tools needed to fix the device properly. 

Apple offers a repair program for iMac A1312 models, which covers the cost of the repair. If your device is eligible, then there's no reason not to take advantage of this program.

However, if you happen to have an older iMac that is no longer covered by the program, all hope is not lost. You can still try to fix the issue yourself or seek out a reputable third-party repair service.

In conclusion, the "GPU LED 1 Present" error message is not the end of the world. It is a well-known issue with the A1312 model, and there are solutions available to fix it. Don't hesitate to reach out to Apple or a third-party repair service to get your beloved iMac back up and running again.

## Chosen Solution
 Past few weeks, I posted a few questions on this website regarding my iMac A1312 not turning on. LED 1 kept lit up so I know there is power coming in.
No chime, no fans, no nothing when I pressed power button.
I changed Power supply, the DC cable, power cord, logic board AND the power button.
NONE of it was the reason that my iMac does not turn on.
In my last resort, I tried boot it without GPU then BAM! I got LED light 2.
When I try to boot up again with GPU slotted in, it went back to LED 1 light only and nothing works. I know I will get a new GPU but my question is, in my countless research of LED 1 and no LED 2, 3, 4 symptom, none of the article mentions faulty GPU.
FYI, I tried the “baking GPU” just in case. Nope, it did not work. I know I will get a new  or used GPU now. :(
Is it something new? or am I going down to another rabbit hole. I spent SO much money on this iMac already. Any help would be appreciated.

 That 2011 27” had an Apple replacement program (now expired).  This is a well known issue.   It usually starts with screen artifacts or blue lines on it.  I have two in the shop now for GPU replacements.  I use the 2GB GPU cards.  Only problem is that they are currently only available from China and take a couple of weeks to get.  Cost is right at $200.00
