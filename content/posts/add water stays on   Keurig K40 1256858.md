## Chosen Solution
 No matter what i do the add water light stays on

 There is a magnetic float sensor in your reservoir that is stuck in the down position. Fill up the reservoir to the max level and tap the side of the reservoir until the float is free (this works better if you remove the reservoir first). You can also use a magnet against the side of the reservoir by the float to help jiggle it free. If this doesnâ€™t work, there is most likely an obstruction blocking the float sensor. Clean the reservoir thoroughly.
