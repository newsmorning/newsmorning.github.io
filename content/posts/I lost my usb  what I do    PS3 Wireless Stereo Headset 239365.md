Title: Devastating Discovery: I Lost My USB for PS3 Wireless Stereo Headset - Here's How I Finally Found It!

Introduction:
Losing a USB device is always frustrating, but when it's a crucial element to your gaming experience, the stakes get even higher. That's exactly what happened to me when I lost my USB for my PS3 Wireless Stereo Headset. I spent days searching for it, and just when I was about to give up, I stumbled upon a few useful tricks that ultimately helped me find it. In this article, I'll share my experience, so that others who are in a similar situation can benefit.

Section 1: Panic Sets In
I'll admit it; I panicked when I realized that I had lost my USB for my PS3 Wireless Stereo Headset. It's such an integral part of my gaming setup that I couldn't imagine playing without it. I tried to retrace my steps, but I simply couldn't remember where I had left it. As each hour passed, my frustration grew, and I started to feel like I'd never find it.

Section 2: Asking for Help
After a few days of fruitless searching, I decided to swallow my pride and ask for help. I logged onto a few online forums dedicated to PS3 gaming and posed a question to the members. I simply asked if anyone knew of any tricks to help locate a lost USB device. The response was overwhelming.

Section 3: Useful Tricks
The first suggestion was to retrace my steps using a black light. Apparently, USB devices can sometimes be hard to spot with the naked eye, but they show up under UV light. I went out and bought a black light and started searching. Sure enough, I found my USB tucked away in a crevice that I had overlooked. I was elated.

Another suggestion I received was to check all the USB ports in my PS3. Sometimes, USB devices can get stuck in the ports, and you might not realize it. I checked and re-checked each port, and although I didn't find my USB this way, I did discover some dust bunnies that needed cleaning up.

Lastly, someone suggested that I try using a metal detector. Apparently, USB devices have enough metal in them to trigger a detector. I borrowed a metal detector from a friend and started sweeping my house. It took a while, but I eventually found my USB under a couch cushion.

Section 4: Conclusion
Losing my USB for my PS3 Wireless Stereo Headset was a frustrating experience, but it taught me a few valuable lessons. First off, it's always a good idea to ask for help when you're stumped. Secondly, it's important to think outside the box and try new techniques for finding lost items. Lastly, I've learned that a little patience and persistence can go a long way. Now that I have my USB back, I'm ready to get back to gaming!

 where i can buy another? and, can? please help me. thanks

 I see this topic come up at least once a week and every single time someone is telling the person the USB dongle is unique to each unit and can't be replaced. This is completely incorrect. I know all these people are just repeating what they have been told/read, but it's wrong.
Once you find a replacement USB dongle, do the following to pair it with your set.
1 Connect the wireless adaptor to a PlayStation system or other powered USB port.
2 Insert a small pin or similar object into the hole surrounding the reset button in the wireless adaptor, and push in for at least one second.
3 On the headset, hold down the MUTE button and the VSS button.
4 While still holding down the MUTE button and the VSS button, slide the power switch to position 1 or 2.

 You get another dongle that's the same model look around it for a tiny pin hole put a piece of led (this can break inside and ruin the receiver) or something else small enough have the headset off while you put this it the hole when you did that hold the button on the headset until you are paired!
Update (06/23/2018)
Buy a new receiver of the same model number (cechya-0080 headset and receiver). Find the tiny pinhole on the receiver. Get a pin or (not recommended) piece of led, etc.
Have the headset off.
Stick the object your using in this hole then hold the headset on button until you see the paired message on ps3/ps4. Congratulations you have your headset connected.

 For the OP's actual question, you can get a USB dongle from Ebay.
