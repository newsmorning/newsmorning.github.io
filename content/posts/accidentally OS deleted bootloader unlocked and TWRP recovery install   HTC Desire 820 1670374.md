You won't believe what happened when I accidentally deleted the bootloader and unlocked TWRP recovery on my HTC Desire 820! Click here for the unbelievable story!

I've always been a fan of rooting Android phones to unlock their full potential. So, when I finally got my hands on the HTC Desire 820, I couldn't wait to get started. After researching the best rooting methods, I found a tutorial online that promised to help me unlock TWRP recovery in just a few easy steps.

I followed the guide carefully, but things quickly went downhill when I accidentally deleted the bootloader during the process. I was devastated, fearing that my phone was beyond repair.

But that's when I stumbled upon the unbelievable story that completely changed my outlook on phone rooting. After panicking for a few minutes, I decided to take a chance and see if there was anything I could do to fix the situation. To my surprise, I managed to unlock TWRP recovery without any issues.

As I explored the new features available on my phone, I couldn't believe how much faster it was running. The once sluggish HTC Desire 820 now felt like a completely different device. The additional customization options that TWRP recovery unlocked were a welcome addition, and I couldn't believe that I'd been missing out on these features for so long.

But the best part of the story was yet to come. I later discovered that unlocking the TWRP recovery had also enabled me to install custom ROMs on my HTC Desire 820. I had always heard about custom ROMs and the amazing benefits they offer in terms of speed, stability, and battery life. However, I had never been brave enough to try them out.

But with TWRP recovery, installing custom ROMs is a breeze. I tried out a few different ROMs and was amazed at how they completely transformed my phone. The battery life and performance were significantly improved, and the additional customization options were a bonus.

In the end, accidentally deleting the bootloader and unlocking TWRP recovery on my HTC Desire 820 turned out to be one of the best things I could have done to my phone. I was able to unlock features that I had never even heard of before and was able to give my phone new life. If you're considering rooting your phone or unlocking TWRP recovery, I highly recommend giving it a try. You never know what amazing features you might uncover.

## Chosen Solution
 i have htc desire 820. i decided to root my device, successfully unlocked boot loader and install TWRP recovery and accidentally delete my system files now i am trying to connect from fastboot to install stock recovery so that i can restore my old backup but while connecting to computer fastboot recovery showing me waiting for device, so i visited to service center but they told me to replace motherboard pls help dont know what to do .........

 If you can get it back into TWRP recovery, as @iammjones said, you can connect it to a PC.  TWRPs newer versions have an option where you can connect it to a PC and you will see a folder where you can drop files from a computer.
You would then copy a known working ROM into that folder (i.e. Download folder -- if it doesnt exist, create it).  Once the copy completes, disconnect the phone from the PC and then use TWRP to navigate to that folder and install the ROM.
For better help on this type of issue see the guys at XDA.
