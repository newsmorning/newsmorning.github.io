# iPhone 6 Owners Beware: Why Your Charge Port May Be Rendering Your Device Useless!

If you're an iPhone 6 owner, then you've probably experienced a charge port issue before. It's a common problem among iPhone users, and it's one that can render your device useless. But, what exactly causes this issue, and how can you prevent it from happening to your phone? In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about charge port issues on your iPhone 6.

## Why Does the Charge Port Fail?

The main reason for charge port issues is that the port is a moving part and can fail over time due to wear and tear. The iPhone 6 is particularly susceptible to this problem because of the way the charging port is designed. Unlike older iPhone models, the iPhone 6 has a lightning port that is slightly recessed, which makes it more difficult to plug in and out of the port. This means that the port is more likely to suffer from wear and tear, causing it to fail over time.

Another reason for charge port issues is that the port can get dirt and debris inside it, which can cause it to malfunction. Dust, lint, and other small particles can easily get inside the port, blocking the connections and causing charging issues. Additionally, if you're using a third-party charging cable, it can cause damage to the charging port over time.

## How to Prevent Charge Port Issues?

Preventing charge port issues on your iPhone 6 is relatively easy if you follow a few simple steps. First, always use the original charging cable that came with your phone. The cable is designed to work specifically with your iPhone, and it's less likely to cause damage to the charging port.

Second, keep your charging port clean. Use a soft-bristled brush to gently remove any dirt or debris inside the charging port. You can also use a can of compressed air to blow out any particles that are too small to remove with a brush.

Third, be careful when plugging in and removing your charging cable. Avoid putting too much pressure on the port when you plug it in or remove it. This will help to prevent damage to the port and will make it last longer.

## What Can You Do When Your Charge Port Fails?

If your iPhone 6 charge port fails, there are a few things you can do to fix the problem. First, try cleaning the port as we mentioned above. If that doesn't work, try using a different charging cable to see if the problem is with the cable and not the port. You can also try restarting your iPhone or resetting your phone's settings to see if that fixes the issue.

If none of these solutions work, it's time to take your iPhone to an authorized repair center. An experienced technician can diagnose and fix the issue, which may involve replacing the charging port. It's important to have the issue fixed by a professional to avoid causing further damage to your iPhone.

In conclusion, charge port issues are a common problem among iPhone 6 owners. However, you can prevent this issue from happening to your phone if you take the necessary precautions. Always use the original charging cable, keep your charging port clean, and be gentle when plugging in and removing your charging cable. If your iPhone does experience charge port issues, take it to an authorized repair center to have it fixed professionally. By following these tips, you can extend the life of your iPhone and avoid rendering your device useless.

## Chosen Solution
 So I've had trouble with my charge port being picky on chargers and now my headphones are being a pain. So I ordered a new charge port and everytime I change it I have no service. I have tried 3 different ones now and still the same issue. They have been eBay ones and I did order one off of here and am just waiting for it to show up in the mail. I just find it hard to believe that 3 of them were defective. I have tried resetting my network settings and still no good. My original one works but the first time I pulled it out I ripped it just a little bit and my speaker doesn't work. Has anybody else had this problem with not having service after changing the charge port. And yes the antenna is hooked up. I have made sure of that on everyone I have replaced.

 Cheap eBay parts. Ifixit part came in and phone is perfect now!

 I have the same problem I got my charging port fixed at one of those repair shops and when I popped in the sim it said no service.. Smh I'm definitely taking it back tomorrow

 You will have to change the antena too, the problem is because its a really tiny piece, so propobly it get damaged while changing the port, try to look the inside of the antena cable it most have a little stick inside, its really weak so probably your plug it in, but doesnt make a conexion with the motherboard.
Good luck

 my lightning port went bad and ordered a new on from IFixit. Change went well, with the exception of getting the antenna connection seated. Felt I had it good and reassembled. Had littler to no signal. Ordered another lightning board, this time inspected the jack and pin with magnifier glass and all looked good. Connected the antenna first and made sure I had a good solid connection, reassembled but still no signal....looks like its time for a new phone....
anyone have luck with this?
