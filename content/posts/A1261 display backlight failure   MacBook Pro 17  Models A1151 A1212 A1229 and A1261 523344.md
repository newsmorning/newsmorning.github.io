Title: Crazy MacBook Pro 17 Backlight Failure: Is Apple Hiding A Major Problem?

Introduction:
Apple has been known for its uninterruptible innovation for more than a decade. It is widely regarded as one of the most powerful tech companies in the world. However, recent reports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro have questioned the company's product quality.

Body:
The 17-inch MacBook Pro is one of the best laptops in the market, with a powerful processor, sleek design, and a wider screen display. Nonetheless, many MacBook Pro 17 users have reported the backlight failure issue, creating a significant inconvenience for both personal and professional use.

The backlight issue affects the entire screen output, and the damaged area glows with a significant tint color, which severely obstructs the user's visibility. The problem can occur at any point, regardless of how the laptop is used.

This issue is severe, and users have been reporting it for years. A Reddit and Apple community discussion showcases multiple victims of the MacBook Pro 17 backlight failure, all sharing their grief over the costly repair fee or the compulsion of abandoning the laptops altogether.

In many cases, Apple repair centers diagnose the failed backlight problem as a logic board problem, which entirely changes the cost for the user from a backlight replacement to many significant expenses that end up pricing the user out of repair.

Moreover, it seems that Apple has not acknowledged the scale of the problem yet, as there is no official statement released regarding the 17-inch MacBook Pro backlight failure. Some online sources believe that Apple is trying to hide the information to prevent users from losing trust in the product quality.

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the MacBook Pro 17 backlight failure issue is growing to become a significant worry for users. While it is not clear whether it’s a hardware or software problem that needs fixing, Apple should be transparent about the scale of the problem, and be proactive in finding a solution to the issue at hand. If untreated, it could lead to bigger concerns within the tech industry's reputation for Apple itself.

## Chosen Solution
 External monitor works so the computer is basically AOK.
Backlight went out at first, worked briefly each time the machine was closed and then reopened. Then total failure.
Replaced the inverter board, no change. My system wasn’t going to sleep when closed. I then replaced the infrared sleep sensor, backlight came on, for about a half an hour, then went off again and regressed to totally dead now.
I don’t understand why it came back on for that time but failed again as if that sensor board had something to do with it.
The system does sleep now when lid is closed (still no backlight). It’s been suggested that the CCFL are failing. I would like opinions about that and if it they need to be replaced. I also need to identify the correct tubes.
Can anyone help? Thanks in advance!

 Sadly, parts for this series are getting hard to find and the CCFL’s are just not available.
If you can, locate a junker to steal the display assembly (complete). Replacing the CCFL’s will require a lot of work and not easy without breaking something.
