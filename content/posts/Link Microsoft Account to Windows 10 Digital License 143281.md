Before we explore the benefits of linking your Microsoft account with Windows 10 digital license, let's first understand what a digital license is.

Now that we know what Windows 10 digital license is let's look at why you should link your Microsoft account with your digital license. Here are some of the benefits:

1. Easy device activation: If you link your Microsoft account with your digital license, you can easily activate Windows 10 on any device without entering a product key again. Simply sign in with your Microsoft account, and Windows will automatically detect the digital license tied to your account and activate the device.

2. Automatic device syncing: Once you link your Microsoft account with your digital license, Windows 10 will automatically sync your settings, preferences, and apps across all your devices. This means that if you make changes to your settings on one device, it will be reflected on all other devices that are linked to your account.

3. More secure: Linking your Microsoft account with your digital license makes your device more secure. If your device is lost or stolen, nobody can activate Windows on another device without your Microsoft account credentials.

4. Access to Microsoft services: By linking your Microsoft account with your digital license, you get access to Microsoft services such as OneDrive, Office 365, Skype, and Xbox Live.

Section 3: How to link your Microsoft account with your Windows 10 digital license?
Linking your Microsoft account with your Windows 10 digital license is a simple process. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to 'Settings' > 'Accounts' > 'Your Info' and click on 'Sign in with a Microsoft account instead'.

2. Enter your Microsoft account credentials and follow the on-screen instructions to link your account with your digital license.

Conclusion:
Linking your Microsoft account with your Windows 10 digital license is one of the best things you can do for your device.
