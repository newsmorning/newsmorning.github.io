## 1. Customize Your Home Screen

One of the best things about Android is the ability to customize your home screen. With the Samsung Galaxy S10, you have even more options. You can add widgets, change the wallpaper, and even change the icon shape. To do this, simply press and hold on an empty space on your home screen and select "Home screen settings."

## 2. Use Google Assistant

Google Assistant is a powerful tool that can help you with everything from setting reminders to controlling your smart home devices. To activate Google Assistant, simply press and hold the home button or say "Hey Google." You can also customize the Assistant's settings to suit your needs.

## 3. Take Advantage of the Camera

The Samsung Galaxy S10 has a fantastic camera, but there are some features you may not be aware of. For example, you can use the Pro Mode to manually adjust the settings for your photos, including the ISO, shutter speed, and more. You can also use the Super Slow-mo feature to capture dramatic slow-motion footage.

## 4. Secure Your Phone with Biometrics

The Samsung Galaxy S10 has several biometric security options, including facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, and an iris scanner. You can set these up in the Settings app under "Biometrics and security." Using these features can help keep your phone secure and protect your personal information.

## 5. Take Advantage of Wireless Charging

The Samsung Galaxy S10 supports wireless charging, which means you can simply place it on a compatible charging pad to charge it up. This can be especially convenient if you have multiple devices that need charging at the same time. You can purchase a wireless charging pad from Samsung or a third-party vendor.

## 6. Customize Your Edge Screen

The Galaxy S10's Edge Screen is a useful feature that lets you access frequently used functions quickly. You can customize what appears on your Edge Screen by going to "Display" in the Settings app and selecting "Edge screen."

## 7. Use Bixby Routines

Bixby Routines is a powerful tool that can automate tasks on your Samsung Galaxy S10. You can set it up to perform certain actions based on specific triggers, such as time of day, location, or which apps you are using. To set up Bixby Routines, go to "Advanced features" in the Settings app and select "Bixby Routines."

## 8. Enable One-Handed Mode

The Samsung Galaxy S10 has a large, beautiful display, but it can be difficult to use with one hand. Fortunately, there's a one-handed mode that makes it easier to reach all parts of the screen. To enable it, go to "Advanced features" in the Settings app and select "One-handed mode."

## 9. Use Samsung Health

Samsung Health is a powerful app that can help you track your fitness goals, monitor your sleep, and even manage your stress levels. With the Samsung Galaxy S10, you can access Samsung Health right from your home screen. Simply swipe right to access the Bixby Home screen and select Samsung Health.

## 10. Take Advantage of DeX Mode

DeX Mode is a feature that lets you use your Samsung Galaxy S10 like a desktop computer. Simply connect your phone to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse using a USB-C to HDMI adapter, and you're good to go. This can be especially useful for productivity tasks or when you need to use multiple apps at once.

These are just a few of the many tips and tricks that can help you unlock the full potential of your Samsung Galaxy S10.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi guys! I'd really appreciate some advice her. I'm trying to make some extra money to support my family. I decided to learn how to fix phones. I've been trying to phone flip. There is a broken samsung galaxy s10. The back glass is cracked, the frame is fine. But the front glass is also cracked. The screen doesnt work, but it flickers when its turned on. I was wondering if a screen swap would fully fix the issue? I was going to offer 130 CAD for it (about 100 usd) is this a fair price to pay?
Also I have some other questions. I need some advice for prices I should pay for broken display phones
Samsung s8 plus broken display
S9 broken display
iPhone x broken display
iPhone 8 broken display
Thank you SO much. I am just a beginner trying to make it in the world. Your advice means alot to me.

 Samsung s8 plus broken display - Make sure to buy replacement screen that with frame, saves the hassle of adhering the replacement screen on and makes it easier to change.
S9 broken display - Same as above. From memory I got my S8+ fixed for $280 AUD prices haven't changed much i think.
iPhone x broken display - There's different qualities of screen. Starting from lowest TFT, colours not good, thicker frame resulting in harder to damage. Around $20 AUD less compared to soft OLED.
Then you have soft OLED flexible but thinner bezels, same style display, good colors but bit pricey. They go around $130-$180 AUD.
Hard OLED, best color reproduction, fragile because non flexible display making it brittle but closest to OEM color quality.
iPhone 8 broken display - Any reputable screen will do. Colors are a bit worse on cheaper aftermarket screens but not too bad.
Yeah the flickering screen is result of damaged display replacing will fix. Depending on how much you get the S10 display for it may be too cheap.
