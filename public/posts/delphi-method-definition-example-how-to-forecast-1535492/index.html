Despite advanced technologies and statistical analysis, forecasting still remains a complicated and uncertain process. However, experts who use the Delphi forecasting technique, a structured method of collecting and summarizing judgments from experts, have consistently produced accurate and reliable forecasts.\nWhat is Delphi Forecasting?\nDelphi forecasting is a structured survey method of eliciting and summarizing judgments from a team of experts on a particular topic. This technique is a combination of a quantitative and qualitative research methodology that aims to reduce the bias and subjectivity that is inherent in other forecasting techniques. Delphi forecasting relies on a series of questionnaires that are used to gather consensus among the experts on specific issues such as trends, events, and probabilities.\nHow Does Delphi Forecasting Work?\nDelphi forecasting involves four basic stages:\nDefine the problem: At this stage, the team of experts is assembled, and the problem or issue to be forecasted is defined. The scope and objectives of the study are also established.\nDevelop the questionnaire: The questionnaire is developed to elicit the opinions and forecasts of the experts. A typical Delphi questionnaire comprises open-ended questions, statements, and ratings.\nCollect and summarize the data: The experts complete the initial questionnaire anonymously. The responses are analyzed, and a summary report is produced highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement.\nFeedback and revision: The summary report is returned to the experts for feedback and revision. The experts are then asked to revise their forecasts based on the prior report and their understanding of the issue.\nBenefits of Delphi Forecasting:\nDelphi forecasting has numerous benefits over other forecasting techniques such as:\nImproved decision making: Delphi forecasting enables decision-makers to make evidence-based decisions on complex issues.\nReliable and accurate forecasts: Delphi forecasting produces accurate and reliable forecasts that are free from bias and subjectivity.\nCohesive team: Delphi forecasting brings together a team of experts with diverse backgrounds and skill sets, fostering cohesion and team spirit.\nFlexibility: Delphi forecasting can be applied to a wide range of issues and can be customized to meet specific requirements.\nConclusion:\nDelphi forecasting is a valuable tool for anyone looking to make accurate and reliable predictions of the future. By bringing together a diverse team of experts, Delphi forecasting eliminates the limitations of a single expert and produces more accurate and reliable forecasts. So, if you are looking to make evidence-based decisions and stay ahead of the curve, try Delphi forecasting today!\nWhat is Delphi Method? Explanation This procedure predicts the possibility and likelihood of an event happening.The initiator or facilitator collects opinions on a topic from an anonymous group of experts.Such a process may involve multiple iterations.Each iteration is performed after receiving coherent feedback from the previous step.The iterations are performed until a unanimous and common consensus is achieved from the chosen experts.The group provides their viewpoints, estimates, and assumptions to the facilitator at each step of the group discussion.After the end of the rounds, experts share their viewpoints and estimates within the group.

How does this Delphi Method Forecast Work? The first step involves the selection and choosing of a facilitator. It is recommended to select a neutral person who remains unbiased throughout the process.Once a facilitator is decided, the second step is selecting the expert panel. The panel may include domain or subject matter experts working in the industry.The subject matter expert is regarded as an individual with critical insight and knowledge to solve problems.The third step involves a decision on the selection of a problem statement. The experts should then be informed on the selected topic to have sufficient time to gather needful points that they can share with the larger group and facilitator.The facilitator then shares the first set of questions through a comprehensive questionnaire.The facilitator collects the completed questionnaire from a larger group, assimilates common points, and removes irrelevant information.The facilitator then shares the second set of questions based on the responses received from the first lot to deep-dive into the problem.The facilitator repeats the above steps until a common consensus arrives and the final results are shared with the target group.The findings and results are analyzed further to determine the solutions and opportunities for the problem statement. Examples of Delphi Method The Delphi technique has big applications in solving high-impact business projects and sensitive political issues. For high-impact projects to be successful, the project manager has to determine the probability of specific events that can occur and analyze how such events affect the projects. In such a scenario, the Delphi method plays an instrumental role in identifying the opportunities and risks related to a project.Similarly, this method plays a key role in formulating public policy by arriving at comprehensive solutions. When is it Used? The Delphi method is used for research and forecasting problems whose solutions are not yet determined. This is used when there is no true answer for a problem statement and requires opinionated decision-making. The Delphi method doesnâ€™t rely on one subject matter expert. Rather, it takes into account opinions from several subject matter experts.The Delphi method is a popular choice for forecasting when the anonymity of subject matter experts is required on difficult subjects or topics such as political significance. This method is used when there is a need to collect a large sample size, and it becomes difficult for face-to-face interactions to draw subjective inferences out of the chosen topic. Advantages T\nThis method provides opportunities to come up and participate.It helps in the early detection of problems and solutions, which helps determine the alternative course of action.After each step and feedback, experts are provided with the opportunity to review their insights and opinions, which they can later change in the succeeding step.The participation by the experts stays anonymous.\nDisadvantages It is time-consuming as the facilitator has to facilitate repetitive rounds of interviews to arrive at a common consensus.The process can become complex with increasing instances of multiple and repetitive rounds.The problem statement has to be transparent and clearly defined.The data collected and collated may have some biased estimates coming from experts themselves, and the facilitator may or may not catch such biases.There are high chances that the group dynamics may get manipulated to force an incorrect solution. Conclusion The process of the Delphi method involves asking multiple rounds of questions to the target group of experts. They do so until they arrive at a common consensus. The process is exploratory and has a broad application in project management and the public domain.Such a method avoids difficult face-to-face interactions and helps solve common problems related to group dynamics. The process collects regular feedback at each step. The method, in short, helps in understanding the likelihood or probability of an event to happen or take place.
