## Chosen Solution
 I have a Whirlpool FWL71252W EU Washing Machine and my problem is (door got stucked) I tried spin and drain  program multiple times but it doesn't drain neither spin after 10 minutes it stops noises and control panels start flashing like this

 @maz01 unplug your washer for a couple of minutes and then plug it back in. Let us know what happens.
Update (05/12/2022)
@maz01 did the water drain when you plugged it back in? did you hear the pump come right on? Is there water in your washer right now? The washer can become locked if something is clogging the pump or filter drain.
The washer door remains locked if there is water in the drum. To unlock it, start the washing machine, select program and deactivate the spin function setting the spin speed to "0". The water should now be drained and the washer is unlocked at completion of the program.
