Even though the minimum system requirements are not demanding, players do tend to experience performance issues from time to time. Fortunately, we bring you the top five ways to optimize your gameplay and eliminate these performance issues once and for all.\nShutting Down Background Applications It is always advisable to keep unnecessary background applications closed while playing Conan Exiles. These applications draw a significant amount of system resources and harm the game’s performance, leading to stuttering and fps drops. Therefore, closing background apps like web browsers and game launchers will significantly improve game performance and ensure smooth gameplay.\nUpdating Windows \u0026 Drivers Updating your system’s drivers and Windows is essential for optimizing game performance. When outdated, these features can cause issues with the game’s graphics, sound, and performance. As a result, keep your Windows operating system and drivers updated regularly to beat any system-related issues that may affect your gameplay.\nLowering your Graphics Settings Conan Exiles offers an array of graphic settings to choose from, from very low to ultra settings. However, for a smoother gaming experience, players should lower the graphics settings to reasonable levels. By doing so, they can enjoy the game without experiencing lags, stuttering, or fps drops. Also, players should avoid settings like bloom, motion blur, and depth of field to boost their fps, resulting in an overall better gaming experience.\nOverclock your GPU Overclocking your graphics processing unit (GPU) can significantly boost your fps, giving you an advantage in combat scenarios. Regular GPU overclocking sessions can also help prevent stuttering and fps drops. Overclocking your GPU comes with a bonus that it gives you more extensive control over your GPU, allowing you to customize settings to optimize your gameplay.\nDisabling V Sync Disabling V Sync can improve game performance, especially if you have a higher-end PC. This feature typically limits your fps to match the refresh rate of your display, causing lag and stutter in the gameplay. Therefore, if you notice occasional frame drops and inconsistent frame rates, disable this feature from your system settings.\nConclusion Now that you know the top five ways of optimizing your Conan Exile gameplay, you can tackle lag, stuttering, and fps drops like a pro. Ensure that you follow the tips, update your system, and reduce background apps to experience smooth gameplay, and enjoy the game to the fullest.

The game’s optimization has improved since its early stages.\nHowever, some players still struggle with their game performance, and certain issues, like the Conan Exiles FPS drops, never get fixed.\nWe will focus on performance difficulties in this article, such as FPS loss, freezing, low FPS, stuttering, lagging, spikes, and high ping, and finally resolve this problem.\nSo, without further ado, let’s dive right into the article and learn more about this issue.\nWhat effects FPS the most? The graphics card and the CPU are the two components that have the most influence on the frame rate or the FPS performance of a game.\nWhen it comes to playing online games, however, internet speed and ping are two additional factors that come into play.\nHowever, before starting any tweaking, make sure that your system is on par with the minimum game requirements below.\nConan Exiles minimum system requirements Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system OS: Windows 10 64 Bit Processor: Intel Quad Core i5-2300 or AMD FX-6300 Memory: 6 GB RAM Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 560 (1GB) or AMD Radeon HD 7770 (1GB) DirectX: Version 11 Network: Broadband Internet connection Storage: 115 GB of available space Now, let’s go through our solutions to fix any FPS drops, lag, and stuttering in Conan Exiles.\nHow do I fix Conan Exiles FPS drops? 1. Eliminate the background processes To open Task Manager, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc. Select the Processes tab to find processes running in the background and using too many system resources. Select the task and then close it by clicking End Task. Repeat for other similar tasks with the high processes. Close any unnecessary programs, such as Chrome, Spotify, and OneDrive. Also, if Discord is idle, you should exit it.\nThese unnecessary apps tend to consume excessive resources and computational power, leaving little power for your PC to use on the game, resulting in Conan Exiles FPS drops.\nSome PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.\nExpert tip:\nSPONSORED\n2. Adjust the game’s graphic settings Go to the in-game graphical settings and make sure to lower the graphics performance settings. For instance, you may disable Vsync, enable the Low-End Laptop Mode, and set the View Distance, Post Processing, General Shadows, and Texture Quality to Low. Test various settings until you get to acceptable game performance. If you have screen tearing while playing, you should re-enable Vertical Sync. The above settings will increase the game’s frame rate while decreasing frame drops.\n3. Add Steam launch options Navigate to the list of titles in your Steam Library. Right-click Conan Exiles and choose Properties. Find the General tab, then click the Launch Options box. In the launch options window, type or paste the following command into the box.-USEALLAVAILABLECORES This command will force your device to use all of your CPU cores to run the game, resulting in significantly more balanced CPU activity.\nHow to Allocate More RAM to Roblox [3 Simple Steps] How to Reset PS5 Controller: 3 Simple Methods to Pick From PUBG Not Using GPU While Gaming: 9 Quick Fixes How to Fix Resident Evil 5 Not Launching on Steam: 7 Ways 4. Update the graphics drivers Enter device manager into the Start Menu Search box and choose the first result. Find the Display Adapters category and expand it by clicking on it. Select Update driver after right-clicking the dedicated graphics device. Then choose Search automatically for drivers. Because outdated drivers are the source of most Windows issues, you should first update your graphics card drivers if your FPS drops.\nFortunately, Windows automatically updates the drivers, but this does not ensure that compatibility issues will not occur.\n5. Disable the fullscreen optimization Navigate to the game’s installation folder: go to Steam, Library, Conan Exiles, Properties, LOCAL FILES, then BROWSE LOCAL FILES. Right-click ConanSandbox.exe. and select the Properties. In the Compatibility tab, tick Disable full-screen optimizations. The Fullscreen Optimizations feature was developed to improve the game experience. However, it can occasionally cause FPS drops.\nTo make sure that everything goes smoothly and avoid any kind of GPU driver errors, be sure to use a complete driver update assistant that will solve your problems with just a couple of clicks, and we strongly recommend DriverFix. Follow these easy steps to safely update your drivers:\nDownload and install DriverFix. Launch the software. Wait for DriverFix to detect all your faulty drivers. The application will now show you all the drivers that have issues, and you just need to select the ones you’d liked fixed. Wait for the app to download and install the newest drivers. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect. Disclaimer: this program needs to be upgraded from the free version in order to perform some specific actions.\nDriverFix Keep you GPU on the peaks of their performance without worrying about its drivers.\nCan RAM cause stuttering? Yes, stuttering could be caused by a RAM shortage. Your system will stutter if you don’t have enough RAM since it can’t handle all the information rapidly.\nGames handle all the data in real time and require a lot of RAM. As a result, RAM that is defective or inadequate might stutter.\nConan Exiles is undoubtedly one of the greatest games in its genre, but FPS drops, and stuttering may quickly ruin the fun of playing it.\nThe best thing to do is to reduce the game’s graphic settings or look on the web for the optimal option that will maintain quality while still giving you adequate performance.\nIn the comment section below, let us know if you were able to fix Conan Exiles FPS drops.\nIf the advices above haven’t solved your issue, your PC may experience deeper Windows problems.
