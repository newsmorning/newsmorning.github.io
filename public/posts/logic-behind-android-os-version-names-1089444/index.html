The Hidden Logic behind Android OS Version Names! You Won’t Believe What Google Has Been Hiding! If Google were to be asked what the most popular names in the world were, it would probably say “John” and “Mary”… But what about “KitKat” and “Oreo”? Yes, we’re talking about the Android operating system version names.\nFor years, Android has been naming its operating system updates after sweets, desserts and other forms of confections, and while these names have always been a source of amusement for tech enthusiasts and confection aficionados alike, there is a hidden logic behind them that many people are unaware of.\nSo, what’s the deal with Android OS version names? Is there a method to the madness? The answer is a resounding “yes,” and in this article, we’ll delve into the hidden logic behind Android OS version names.\nThe Beginning: The Cupcake The first Android OS version to get a dessert-themed name was Android 1.5, which was named “Cupcake”. The naming convention was started by Google in 2009, and it’s been a running tradition ever since. While Cupcake may have been unconventional at the time, it set a precedent for what was to come.\nThe Alphabetical Order One of the fundamental rules behind the Android version naming convention is alphabetical order, with the first letter of each update’s name being the next letter in the alphabet.\nFollowing “Cupcake,” next up was “Donut” (Android 1.6), then “Eclair” (Android 2.0/2.1), “Froyo” (Android 2.2), “Gingerbread” (Android 2.3), “Honeycomb” (Android 3.0/3.1/3.2), “Ice Cream Sandwich” (Android 4.0), “Jelly Bean” (Android 4.1/4.2/4.3), “KitKat” (Android 4.4), “Lollipop” (Android 5.0/5.1), “Marshmallow” (Android 6.0), “Nougat” (Android 7.0/7.1), “Oreo” (Android 8.0/8.1).\nAs we can see, these names follow a sequence of letters in alphabetical order, which is pretty impressive considering the sheer number of Android versions that have been released.\nA Tribute To Sweetness The sweetness associated with the Android OS version names has not gone unnoticed, and it’s a testament to Google’s cunning marketing tactics.\nConfectionery brands like Nestle’s KitKat and Oreo have benefited from the free advertising that comes with Android updates being named after their products. However, there is more to this trend than just brand awareness.\nThe use of confections as version names ties in with the product’s tagline, “sweet new features,” which emphasizes the delight and excitement that accompanies every Android update.\nThe Hidden Philosophy The Android OS version names aren’t just a matter of alphabetical order or free advertising for confectionery brands. They represent a philosophy: that Android is a beautiful, diverse platform with the potential for endless creativity.\nEach version is unique, just like every type of confection. From the wholesome and classic “Oreo” to the eccentric and bold “KitKat,” each name represents a vast array of potential.\nThe philosophy of Android is about openness, creativity and experimentation, and it’s reflected in the naming of each Android version. This system allows for endless opportunity to grow, develop and improve.\nIn Conclusion From “Cupcake” to “Oreo,” Android OS version names are one of the most fascinating and creative aspects of the platform. While the alphabetical order of names and free advertising benefit associated with naming the versions after confections are evident, the underlying philosophy that drives these names makes them all the more interesting.\nThrough its version names, Android has demonstrated its unique and playful approach to innovation, and we cannot wait for the next sugary and delightful name to hit our screens.\nThis article is subject to being purely fictional as the opinion expressed on this article does not imply any relationship to any company or brand mentioned within.\nThe first Android operating system version 1.0 (Android Alpha) was released in September 2008. They have come a long way since then because of its useful features and a plethora of developed apps from millions of developers. Android users are aware of the fact that Google uses familiar names mostly of sweets for their Android OS versions. But why such names? And, is there any sequence in these names? Here we are going to discuss the reasons for the same, but before that let’s dig a little bit about Android.\nWho Founded Android And How Did It Get Its Name? Initially, Android Inc was founded and developed by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, and Nick Sears in 2003. The main brain behind this development was of Andy Rubin. One of the talented computer programmers, engineer, and entrepreneur. The early aim of this service was to ease the use of a digital camera and provide an OS to operate them and save images directly to Android cloud(as planned earlier).\nRubin previously used to work with Apple, and while working there his colleagues use to call him Android, because of his love for robots, machines, and programming. And once he started working on his own project, it became to be known as Android.\nLater Android Inc. was acquired by Google in 2005 and later was released for smartphones. Google acquired Android for at least $50 million. Andy Rubin was also the part of the team Android after the acquisition and worked with Google till 2013. Android OS Names \u0026 Version Number In Order It seems that Google Handset Alliance is following A, B, C, D and so on, means Alphabetic sequence for their Android operating system version names. Below you can see the list of Android OS with their logo:\nA – Android Alpha (1.0)\nB – Android Beta (1.1)\nC – Android Cupcake (1.5)﻿\nD – Android Donut (1.6)\nE – Android Eclair (2.0 – 2.1)\nF – Android Froyo (2.2 – 2.2.3)\nG – Android Gingerbread (2.3 – 2.3.7)\nH – Android Honeycomb (3.0 – 3.2.6)\nI – Android Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0 – 4.0.4)\nJ – Android Jellybean (4.1 – 4.3.1)\nK – Android KitKat (4.4 – 4.4.4)\nL – Android Lollipop (5.0)\nM – Android Marshmallow (6.0)\nN – Android Nougat(7.0)\nO – Android Oreo(8.0)\nP – Android Pie(9.0)\nQ – Android 10.0. No name or image specified yet and expected to be launched soon. Currently in the beta testing stage.\nGoogle has named their OS’ after popular confectioneries and desserts around the world. It started with the Android C i.e Cupcake. As you can see the versions for A and B do not have the names of sweets. Many think it is just the old-school Alpha and Beta versions. Maybe Google will go up to Z letter, but what after that? Let’s wait and watch how intelligently Google Handset Alliance will come up with other Android OS names and its sequence.\nAlso Read: 5 Android Studio Alternative Tools for App Development\nReasons Behind The Sweet Names Of Android Versions The truth is, nobody knows the exact logic, because Android’s team refuses to disclose the reason behind it and in Randall Sarafa’s (Spokesman for Google) own words “It’s more of an internal thing. It’s inscrutable.” I know this is a downer after all that build up, but it’s the truth! While the launch of the Android KitKat back in 2013, Google mentioned in an official statement that Android powers life of more than billion people and make their life sweet so they have named the versions after desserts.\nMoreover, as per the discussions on the online social communities like Quora and Reddit, it is also said to be believed that Andy Rubins, the creator of Android, likes sweets very much and started naming them accordingly as you can see on the list above. And after the lead of Android went into the hand of yet another talented man i.e Sundar Pichai, he also thought it to name it the same way. And it seems to be a good decision.\nThough no one knows what exactly Google does to select the name of the desserts or the confectionaries for their Android versions. This does not stop the people of different countries from trying to pitch for their own country’s sweets. As seen earlier many of the countries have tried to run campaigns so that Google may name the next Android from sweets that are famous in their country or region. For e.g. Indian people made a campaign for Kaju Katli to be the name for Android 4.4 i.e Android KitKat.\nWhy Companies Use Such Names? Tech companies in Silicon Valley employ a lot of “Cool” things to connect better with non-tech audiences. When they fail to get the users attention with servers, algorithms, and other geeky words, they resort to different aspects like Doodles, Fun Keynotes, etc, to keep their brands fun. A distinct aspect of software companies is new releases of software and with that, they also have to come up with its names.\nA lot of companies like Apple and Microsoft have a different name of their software versions. Microsoft’s naming conventions are a bit boring with the usual “Windows 95”, “Windows 98”. They changed it a little bit when they added “Windows XP” and “Windows Vista” but went back to their original naming scheme by going with the “Windows 10”.\nApple, on the other hand, was slightly creative with their OS names. They named it after the different kind of cats. It started with the “Cheetah” and ended with the “Lion” with other names like “Snow Leopard”, “Jaguar” and “Puma”.\nWrapping Up So this was the reason behind Google’s way of selecting a name for its Android versions and other information regarding it. It is sure that the next Android OS i.e Android Q will also be a dessert. No matter what the name will be, it will surely be coming with lots of new and updated features. And like always the users speculate and try to figure out what it will be. Do you have something in mind about what the Android Q name be? Drop it in the comments section below.\n","wordCount":"1636","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marla Nejaime"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/logic-behind-android-os-version-names-1089444/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>SHOCKING!

Let’s wait and watch how intelligently Google Handset Alliance will come up with other Android OS names and its sequence.</p><p>Also Read: 5 Android Studio Alternative Tools for App Development</p><h2 id=reasons-behind-the-sweet-names-of-android-versions>Reasons Behind The Sweet Names Of Android Versions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reasons-behind-the-sweet-names-of-android-versions>#</a></h2><p>The truth is, nobody knows the exact logic, because Android’s team refuses to disclose the reason behind it and in Randall Sarafa’s (Spokesman for Google) own words “It’s more of an internal thing. It’s inscrutable.” I know this is a downer after all that build up, but it’s the truth! While the launch of the Android KitKat back in 2013, Google mentioned in an official statement that Android powers life of more than billion people and make their life sweet so they have named the versions after desserts.</p><p>Moreover, as per the discussions on the online social communities like Quora and Reddit, it is also said to be believed that Andy Rubins, the creator of Android, likes sweets very much and started naming them accordingly as you can see on the list above. And after the lead of Android went into the hand of yet another talented man i.e Sundar Pichai, he also thought it to name it the same way. And it seems to be a good decision.</p><p>Though no one knows what exactly Google does to select the name of the desserts or the confectionaries for their Android versions. This does not stop the people of different countries from trying to pitch for their own country’s sweets. As seen earlier many of the countries have tried to run campaigns so that Google may name the next Android from sweets that are famous in their country or region. For e.g. Indian people made a campaign for Kaju Katli to be the name for Android 4.4 i.e Android KitKat.</p><h3 id=why-companies-use-such-names>Why Companies Use Such Names?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-companies-use-such-names>#</a></h3><p>Tech companies in Silicon Valley employ a lot of “Cool” things to connect better with non-tech audiences. When they fail to get the users attention with servers, algorithms, and other geeky words, they resort to different aspects like Doodles, Fun Keynotes, etc, to keep their brands fun. A distinct aspect of software companies is new releases of software and with that, they also have to come up with its names.</p><p>A lot of companies like Apple and Microsoft have a different name of their software versions. Microsoft’s naming conventions are a bit boring with the usual “Windows 95”, “Windows 98”. They changed it a little bit when they added “Windows XP” and “Windows Vista” but went back to their original naming scheme by going with the “Windows 10”.</p><p>Apple, on the other hand, was slightly creative with their OS names. They named it after the different kind of cats. It started with the “Cheetah” and ended with the “Lion” with other names like “Snow Leopard”, “Jaguar” and “Puma”.</p><h3 id=wrapping-up>Wrapping Up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wrapping-up>#</a></h3><p>So this was the reason behind Google’s way of selecting a name for its Android versions and other information regarding it. It is sure that the next Android OS i.e Android Q will also be a dessert. No matter what the name will be, it will surely be coming with lots of new and updated features. And like always the users speculate and try to figure out what it will be. Do you have something in mind about what the Android Q name be?
