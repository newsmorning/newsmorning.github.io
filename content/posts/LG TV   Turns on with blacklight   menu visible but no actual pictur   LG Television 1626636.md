# LG TV Showed No Picture - Until I Discovered This One Simple Trick!

The feeling of excitement that comes with purchasing a new television can be irreplaceable. It is not uncommon for the first few days or weeks after unboxing it to be spent glued to it, experiencing an array of emotions as you watch your favorite shows or movies. However, what happens when that excitement is met with frustration because the TV suddenly shows no picture? That can be a nightmare! This was my experience with my LG TV recently.

For weeks, my LG TV was my source of entertainment, and it worked perfectly until one day when the screen went blank. I tried to power on and off the TV multiple times, and nothing worked. The sound was okay, but the screen showed no image. My initial reaction was to panic because this was the first time it had happened. So, I did what anyone would do – I went straight to Google to search for a solution.

I scoured the internet for every possible fix, and some of the suggestions did work for a short time, but the issue kept recurring. I started to think that I would have to call a repairman or replace the entire television, which was disappointing because I had only just purchased it.

One day, while trying to fix the issue again, I stumbled upon a YouTube video that claimed to have the solution. I was skeptical at first, but I was also desperate to try anything to salvage the TV. So, I clicked on the video, and that’s when I discovered the one simple trick that fixed my LG TV.

The trick involved resetting the TV to its factory settings. It was something I had never considered because I had assumed the problem was hardware-related. However, as it turned out, the software had become corrupted, leading to the blank screen. The reset worked like a charm. The television powered back on like it was brand new.

Now, my LG TV works perfectly again, and I haven't experienced the issue since. In fact, I feel like it's even better than before. The colors are brighter, the sound is clearer, and it seems to be more responsive.

The lesson I learned from this experience is that sometimes, the solutions to our problems can be simple. We often tend to overthink things or assume the worst-case scenario. Before giving up on a situation or calling for help, it's essential to do some research and try out different solutions that are within our reach.

In conclusion, repairing electronics can be intimidating, especially when the malfunction is as critical as a blank screen on a television. However, always remember there is hope, and you can salvage the situation if you take the time to troubleshoot and research. With this one simple trick, I saved myself the cost and frustration of having to replace my LG TV or call for a repair.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello all,
This is concerning my LG television model 47LV4400-UA. It powers on (red standby light turns blue) and the menu appears on the screen, but there is no picture. “No signal” message on all inputs.
I tried all the HDMI ports and switching HDMI cables for the cable box. With the 2nd cable, the screen went solid pink but I think that was a faulty cable I had around.  With the 3rd cable, a message “HDCP authorization failure. hdmi port is disabled” appeared over the picture, then “No Signal” returned after 10 seconds. I plugged in the original HDMI cable and reset the cable box. I again received the “HDMI port disabled” message as the cable box booted up, followed by the “No Signal” screen.
I also tried streaming video using my Chromecast and audio would play through the TV, but no picture. Reset the Chromecast, same problem. The next day, no audio or video.
Any thoughts on the possible issue? I unfortunately do not have another TV to test the devices on
Thanks for your time!

 Alexander Yepes no picture but shows the menu is commonly caused by a bad main board. There is a slight possibility that it could be corrupted EEPROM. Your service menu may have a reset for that.
If that does not help, remove the back of your TV and take a look at your boards. Post some good pictures of those with your question so we can see what you see. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that. On the Mainboard should be a component labelled U14 which is the system EEPROM . Let us know once you found it and post some good images of location on the board etc. Temporarily bridging pin 5 and pin 8 with something like a paperclip should reset this EEPROM. Do this only after you check everything else first.
