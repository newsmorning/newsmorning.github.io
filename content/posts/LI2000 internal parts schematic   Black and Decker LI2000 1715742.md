# Unlock the Secrets of Your Black and Decker Li2000 with this Exclusive Internal Parts Schematic!

Are you the proud owner of a Black and Decker Li2000? If yes, then you probably know how handy it is to have a cordless screwdriver that can handle any job around the house. However, have you ever wondered how this screwdriver works on the inside? If so, then you're in luck! In this article, we will unveil the internal components of your Li2000 and help you understand how it works and how you can maintain it.

## 1. The Motor and Gearbox Assembly

The heart of the Li2000 is its motor and gearbox assembly. The motor is a 3.6-volt DC motor that delivers up to 40 inch-pounds of torque. The gearbox is made up of a set of gears that help to convert the high-speed rotation of the motor into the low-speed, high-torque output needed for screwdriving.

## 2. The Battery

The Li2000 comes with a 3.6-volt lithium-ion battery that can hold a charge for up to 18 months. This battery is designed to provide maximum power and runtime while reducing the overall weight of the screwdriver. The battery pack also features a built-in LED indicator that lets you know when it's time to recharge the battery.

## 3. The Charger

The charger that comes with the Li2000 is a 120-volt AC charger that can fully recharge the battery in about 6 hours. The charger uses a smart charging system that monitors the battery's temperature and voltage to ensure that it's charged safely and efficiently.

## 4. The Switch Assembly

The switch assembly of the Li2000 includes a trigger switch that controls the power to the motor and a direction switch that allows you to switch between forward and reverse modes. The switch assembly is also designed to be ergonomic and easy to use, ensuring that you can comfortably control the screwdriver for extended periods of time.

## 5. The Chuck Assembly

The chuck assembly of the Li2000 is where you attach the screwdriver bits. The Li2000 features a one-handed, quick-release chuck that allows you to change bits quickly and easily. The chuck also includes an automatic spindle lock that prevents the chuck from turning when you're changing bits.

## 6. Maintenance

To keep your Li2000 working in top condition, you should periodically clean the exterior of the screwdriver with a soft, damp cloth. You should also inspect the chuck assembly and the switch assembly for any damage or wear. If you notice any damage or wear, you may need to replace the affected parts.

In conclusion, the Black and Decker Li2000 is a versatile and powerful cordless screwdriver that can handle any job around the house. By understanding the internal components of your Li2000 and how they work together, you can better appreciate its design and keep it in optimal working condition for years to come. So, take a closer look at your Li2000, and unlock its secrets with this exclusive internal parts schematic!
