Owners Beware: Shocking Discovery About LG Washing Machine - Find Out Why It Only Spins During Drying Cycles!

Are you the proud owner of an LG washing machine? If so, you need to read this article carefully to know how to keep your machine optically sound.

LG Corporation is a South Korean-based multinational electronics company that excels in the production of a wide range of home electronics and home appliances. One of their best-selling products is the LG washing machine. Its sleek design, advanced features, and reputation for durability have won the hearts of many homeowners.

However, a recent discovery about this machine has caused concern among its users, especially those who have recently purchased it or are considering buying one. According to several LG washing machine owners, their machines only spin during the drying cycle, which is strange, to say the least.

But why would an LG washing machine only spin during the drying cycle? Here are some reasons and tips for avoiding such a problem.

1. Damaged Motion Sensor:

One possible reason why your LG washing machine only spins during drying cycles is that the motion sensor is damaged. In most washing machines, the motion sensor detects movement in the drum and adjusts the spin cycle accordingly. If the motion sensor is damaged, the machine may only spin during the drying cycle.

You should inspect your washing machine's motion sensor regularly to ensure that it is functioning correctly. If you ever notice any signs of damage or malfunction, you must contact a professional as soon as possible to avoid a total breakdown.

2. Overloading:

Another reason why your LG washing machine only spins during the drying cycle is overloading. Overloading puts a considerable amount of strain on your machine's motor, which can lead to a breakdown or even stop working. To prevent overloading, ensure you follow the machine's load capacity instructions in the manual. Overloading is a common problem that could have severe repercussions for the machine.

3. Defective Motor:

The motor is the heart of any washing machine. In this regard, if the motor is defective or broken, the machine can only spin during the drying cycle, or it may not spin at all. You should contact a technician to diagnose and troubleshoot your washing machine if you suspect that the motor is faulty.

4. Faulty Circuit Board:

The circuit board controls various components of your washing machine. If the circuit board is faulty or damaged, it could cause your machine to operate abnormally. You should inspect your washing machine's circuit board regularly and clean it of all debris regularly.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, LG washing machines are reliable and durable machines capable of handling different laundry loads. However, these machines are not exempt from developing faults that can disrupt them from operating normally. As a homeowner, you should take a keen interest in your machine's maintenance, follow the instructions outlined in the manual, and learn how to identify when things are not okay. Always hire a professional technician to diagnose and troubleshoot any problem youâ€™re unsure of.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, my LG fuzzy logic (old model) was bought around 2012(?). No problems ever until yesterday when it did not spin in WASH and RINSE setting. The motor was working but the inside is not spinning enough to clean clothes (even detergent did not melt). When drying it spinned well, dried the clothes like usual.  We suspected it to be a belt problem.. but we have not tried buying a new belt.

 Inspect the drive belt to determine if it is broken or if it is loose on the pulleys. If the drive belt is broken or loose, replace it.

 Good day my Fuzzy Logic 8.5 kg washing machine does not wash the drum does not turn and it makes alot of noise but the spinner works 100% with a little bit noise but does spin
