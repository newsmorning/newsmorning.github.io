## Chosen Solution
 Hello, All
I’m wondering if you all could assist me in identifying these parts and where I could source them. Your assistance would be greatly appreciate.

 The component circled in the picture is normally referred to as a display hinge. They appear to be available for older model MacBook Pros but I’m struggling to find a supplier for 2016+ MBPs. It might be easiest to purchase a damaged display at a discount and then pull them from the display. Good luck!
