Title: Is Your Refrigerator Feeling Hotter Than You? Discover the Surprising Reason Why!

Introduction:

We all count on our refrigerators to keep our food fresh and cool. However, what happens when your refrigerator starts feeling warm? You might think that it's just a minor issue, but it could actually be a sign of a bigger problem. In this article, we will discuss the surprising reason why your refrigerator might feel hotter than you and what you can do to fix it.

Body:

There are various reasons why your refrigerator might be feeling hotter than you. Here are some of them:

1. Dirty Condenser Coils: The condenser coils on the back or bottom of your refrigerator help release heat. However, when they get dirty, they cannot function properly, and your refrigerator can feel warm. You can clean them with a vacuum cleaner or a brush to remove any dirt, dust or debris.

2. Blocked Air Vents: Your refrigerator has air vents that help circulate the cool air throughout. When these vents get blocked by food items or debris, they cannot function properly, and your refrigerator can feel warm. You can clean them by removing any obstructions and ensuring that the vents are not covered.

3. Faulty Thermostat: Your refrigerator's thermostat controls the temperature inside the appliance. When it's not working correctly, it can cause your refrigerator to feel warmer than usual. You may need to replace the thermostat to fix the issue.

4. Overloaded Refrigerator: When you overfill your refrigerator, it can affect the air flow and prevent the cool air from circulating. This can cause your refrigerator to feel warm. You can solve the issue by removing some of the food items, ensuring that air can circulate freely.

5. Broken Cooling Fan: The cooling fan circulates cool air in your refrigerator. If it stops functioning correctly, your refrigerator can feel warmer than usual. You may need to replace the fan to fix the issue.

Conclusion:

A refrigerator that feels warmer than usual is not something to ignore. Not only can it affect the quality of your food, but it could also be a sign of a bigger problem. By understanding the reasons why your refrigerator is feeling warmer than usual, you can take the necessary steps to fix the problem. Cleaning the condenser coils and air vents, ensuring that the thermostat is working correctly, not overloading the refrigerator and replacing a broken cooling fan are all steps that can help. With these handy tips, you can keep your refrigerator functioning at its best and enjoy fresh, cool food whenever you need it.

## Chosen Solution
 Kitchen Aid refrigerator temperature keeps rising especially in the freezer. Model kfcs22evms2. It is fairly new and has worked well until last few days. Fridge is full of food but not too extreme degree and has previously held as much with no problem. Freezer temperature starter rising slowly a few days ago and is now at 24 F. Last night, I vacuumed a moderate amount of dust/lint from coils at bottom front (behind grille) but the temperature rise continues. There is no dust around the back panel, fan is blowing strongly. There is no blockage or obstruction around the air vents inside fridge or freezer.
