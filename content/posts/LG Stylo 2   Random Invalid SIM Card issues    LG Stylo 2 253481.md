## Chosen Solution
 I bought a LG Stylo 2 about a week ago and had WALMART activate it on the spot. Randomly yesterday i lost ALL service and its now showing Invalid SIM card. Ive tried everything from restarting taking out my SIM and reinserting to a complete factory reset and nothing has fixed it. Can someone please help?

 I had them send me a replacement SIM but the problem occurred again a week later.
It's a fairly common issue.
They ended up sending me a replacement phone.

 Crap that's exactly what mine is doing I just got it. I've had it for 2 weeks now and can't use it. This will be the 3rd SIM card Straight talk has sent me in efforts to fix the problem...
