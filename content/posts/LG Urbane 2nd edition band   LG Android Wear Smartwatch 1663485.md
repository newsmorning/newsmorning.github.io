## Chosen Solution
 Hello.
Where can I buy a bracelet for my LG Urbane 2nd edition W200V?
Grateful.

 You can't ! This is the shitiest watch band ever, and therefore no one sells one. Not even LG. You have to use the warranty if you want that sh1t replaced with the same sh1t. But when the warranty is done, you're left with a broken band that you can't replace...good job LG, now this is what I call "customer support".

 Mario, you can still send the watch in to LG for repair outside of warranty, as the unhelpful response failed to mention (sounds like they are rather bitter about something).  The watch band contains the antenna for the device, which may help to explain why LG doesn't simply sell replacements, as an improper repair to the band could compromise the water tight seal on the device. This may also explain why this watch works so well as a phone.  It is also worth nothing that LG will charge you $19.99 just to diagnose the repair if it is out of warranty.
