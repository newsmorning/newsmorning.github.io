You Won't Believe the Harsh Truths About Windows 11's Lack of User Friendliness!

The newest operating system from Microsoft, Windows 11, is the talk of the town. While Microsoft claims to have made several improvements, many users are not pleased with the new update. In fact, some harsh truths about Windows 11's lack of user-friendliness have come to light that might surprise you.

Here are some of the harshest truths about Windows 11:

1. No More Live Tiles

Windows 8 and 10 had live tiles, which made it easy for users to access their favorite apps and information. However, Windows 11 does not include live tiles, making it inconvenient for users who relied on them to navigate through their system. The new start menu design, which is centered and looks more like a macOS dock, is also not user-friendly and confuses many users.

2. No More Control Panel

Windows 11 no longer has the traditional Control Panel that users have been using for years. Instead, it has a new Settings app that is not only confusing but also lacks some of the features of the old Control Panel. This means that users will need to learn an entirely new navigation system to control settings on their devices.

3. Limited Customization

Microsoft has taken away the ability to customize and personalize the desktop in Windows 11. Users can no longer change their desktop backgrounds or alter the transparency of the taskbar. These little tweaks may seem insignificant, but for many users, these personalized touches made their PCs feel unique and tailored to their tastes.

4. No More Windows Updates

Windows 11 updates are now mandatory, and there is no way to turn them off. This can be a significant issue for people who have limited data plans or slow internet connections. Forced updates are frustrating, and some users would like the freedom to choose when to run the updates.

5. No Support for Older Processors

One of the harshest truths about Windows 11 is that it does not support older processors. This means that people with older laptops and PCs will have to upgrade their hardware to run the new operating system. This puts an additional burden on consumers who are already struggling with the effects of the global chip shortage and rising prices.

In conclusion, while Windows 11 has a new and fresh look, it is clear that Microsoft has neglected to consider user-friendliness. The lack of live tiles, control panel, and customization options, coupled with mandatory updates and the lack of support for older processors, makes it a challenging operating system for many users. We hope that Microsoft takes note of these issues and addresses them in future updates.

Some say that Windows 11 is the worst Windows ever. That’s hard to judge; it depends on your needs and preferences. The biggest problem users have with Windows 11 is that it’s not what they’re used to. 
 
A section of users say Windows 11 came up with many new features to enhance user experience and security and is the best version of Windows yet.
 
Others say the minimum system requirements are too stringent and hence face performance problems due to insufficient RAM. To run Windows 11, you need at least 4 GB of memory space.
 
While opinions differ, not everything is sunshine and rainbows. There are some undeniable realities that make the OS not user-friendly.
 
## What are some of the realities that make Windows 11 not user-friendly? 
 
### 1. Hardware requirements
 
Windows 11 is not free like previous versions of the operating system were. Because Windows 11 is so feature-packed than Windows 10, its hardware requirements have also gone up. Unfortunately, they might be too high for some people.
 
If you’re planning to upgrade your current PC to Windows 11, make sure that it meets the minimum hardware requirements by using the PC Health Check App.
 
Failure to which, your device may not have enough processing power and memory to run Windows 11 efficiently.
 
In some cases, some users have been able to upgrade by bypassing some of the requirements. Their devices have however been lagging and facing a bunch of performance issues.
 
Such experiences take away from the beauty of enjoying all that Windows 11 has to offer. This ends up leaving a bad taste in your mouth.
 
### 2. Interface overhaul
 
By now, you already know that the Windows 11 interface is quite different from its predecessors. The new user interface will take some getting used to. 
 
Microsoft has made improvements in the Start Menu and Settings app. However, some people still prefer to use the old interface.
 
If you’re one of those people who like the old desktop UI more than the new Start Menu in Windows 11, you can easily revert back to the old desktop UI.
 
### 3. Offline accounts
 
If you’re a Windows 11 Home user, you may find your laptop or desktop will not be able to sync with your Microsoft account.
 
The Offline account option has been removed. By default, the only way to get online is by manually going through the online activation process.

Expert tip:

Since Microsoft is not able to support offline accounts, this means that you need an internet connection to access your files and documents.
 
This is a huge disadvantage for those who want to use their computer in the office or at home and work on documents offline.
 
### 4. Default apps
 
Microsoft has altered the process of changing default applications in Windows 11 or at least how it appears to many users who are unable to find options that they believe should be included.
 
The process is now harder as more options have been included in the context menu. When you open it now, you have to click on each one individually to set them as your default applications. What’s even worse, once you select the individual app, there is no option to set for all.
 
### 5. App-related upgrades
 
As Microsoft works on improving Windows 11, so are the related apps to ensure they follow the same interface. As such, applications such as Photos are also getting some useful features scrapped off.
 
If you enjoy these apps, you may wake up and find out one day that some favorite features are missing. This can be frustrating but it is a harsh reality that the updates are across the board and are likely to affect more apps.
 
### What are the disadvantages of Windows 11?
 
Some of the disadvantages of using Windows 11 include:
 
- Show All Apps by Default in Windows 11 Start Menu [2 Tips]
 - Bad Sectors Were Encountered During the Format [Windows 11 Fix]

 
- You have to sign in with a Microsoft account to use Windows 11. If you want to set up Windows without signing in with an online ID, you can’t. You must sign in with a Microsoft account or create one during setup.

 
- Some built-in OS functions and features are exclusive to the Edge browser. Therefore, if you use Firefox or Chrome instead, you won’t be able to take advantage of them.
 - There’s no way to change where the taskbar is located, which has been a staple of Windows. You can’t move it to the top or side of the screen anymore. It’s locked to the bottom only. You can still auto-hide it, and there are new settings that let you show or hide labels on icons in the taskbar. However, if you want to move the bar somewhere else, you’re out of luck.
 - There are also some glitches and bugs with the new operating system. While this is not unusual, it can be annoying if you are trying to upgrade your computer. These issues interfere with your ability to use the software correctly.
 - The Windows 11 trial period is short and gives you just ten days to test out the new operating system. That might be enough time for some before you commit. After that period has passed, there is no going back.
 - Since the OS will require more resources than its predecessors, if you are using an older computer, you might experience slower performance when using Windows 11. You need to have a powerful computer to run this OS smoothly. This means you have to spend more money on updating your current computer or buying a new one!

 
### What do you dislike about Windows 11?
 
Like any OS, there are some features that will not sit well with users. The features may be functional but after years of getting accustomed to a certain way of things, suddenly making changes could spark up a dislike.
 
Some of the common disliked features include:
 
- Start Menu – The Windows 11 Start Menu is newly improved with more features than its predecessors but compared to Windows 10, the Windows 11 version is somewhat annoying. There is no option to see recently used apps instead, you only get to see recommended and pinned apps.

 
- Pre-installed apps – Previous Windows versions had some pre-installed apps whenever you made the upgrade but in Windows 11, a majority of these apps only appear as shortcuts whereby you have to go to the Microsoft Store if you want to use them.
 - Default browser – Although Microsoft is not forcing you to select Edge as the default browser, it is making it harder to include other apps and limiting some functions when you use other browsers.
 - Cortana – If you would like to use Cortana in Windows 11, you have to download it from the App Store. The same goes for Skype and other apps that were previously in-built.

 
Each user is different so the dislikes on this list may actually be some of the best features for another user. 
 
Windows 11 is still fairly new in the market and Microsoft is still working on updates so at some point, some of these features may get a major boost that makes them more user-friendly.
