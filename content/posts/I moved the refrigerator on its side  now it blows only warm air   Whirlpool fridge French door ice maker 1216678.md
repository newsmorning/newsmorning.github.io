Moving to a new home can be exciting and stressful at the same time. It's the beginning of a new adventure, but packing and unpacking can be overwhelming. When my family and I moved to a new house, we brought our trusty Whirlpool French door fridge with us.

We were happy with our decision since this fridge had been serving us well for years. We had never had any problems with it, and it always kept our food fresh and cool. However, when we moved it to our new home, something went wrong, and it stopped working completely.

At first, we thought that it was just a minor glitch, and we could fix it ourselves. We checked the power source and made sure that everything was plugged in correctly. We also checked the temperature settings and ensured that they were at optimal levels. Unfortunately, none of these efforts worked, and the fridge remained unresponsive.

It was then that we realized that we might have damaged the appliance during the move. It's not uncommon for fridges to malfunction after being moved. The jarring movements during transportation and the impact of the bumps can cause damage to the motor, coils, or compressor.

We immediately called a technician to come and inspect the fridge. After a thorough check, the technician confirmed what we had feared- the fridge's motor had been damaged during the move. It needed a replacement, which would be costly and time-consuming.

We were disappointed but had no choice but to spend the money to repair the fridge since we needed it. The incident taught us a valuable lesson- never move appliances without professional help. Appliances are delicate and need to be handled with care during transportation. Attempting to move them by ourselves can cause more harm than good.

In conclusion, moving to a new home can be exciting, but it can also be stressful. Always take care when transporting appliances such as fridges. It's better to seek professional help than to risk damaging the appliance. Hopefully, our experience with our Whirlpool French door fridge will prevent others from making the same mistake we did.

## Chosen Solution
 I moved a refrigerator layin it on its side.  I set it up, waited 4 days, plugged it in and it only blows warm air.  Is there anything I can do to fix it?

 Check to see if the compressor is running. If not, you'll need a meter to see why. Incoming power to compressor? Start cap good? If the compressor is running, is it really hot? Is the hot gas line hot? Line from compressor warm? Suction line cool? Condenser fan (if it has one) running? Is the evap fan inside the freezer running? Check it out and see what isn't running.
