As a proud owner of a Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 model, I was devastated when an accidental liquid spill left my beloved laptop struggling to perform even the most basic tasks. The once lightning-fast machine was now lagging, freezing, and worst of all, its fan was in a constant overactive state. As someone who relies heavily on their laptop for work and personal use, this was a nightmare scenario.

Initially, I hoped that the problem was temporary and that the laptop would eventually recover on its own. Unfortunately, that was not the case. As days passed, the laptop's performance degradation became more pronounced with each passing moment, and the fan's noise became unbearable. I knew I had to take action fast, or my work productivity would suffer immensely.

I took my laptop to the authorized Apple service center, and they declared that liquid damage had caused corrosion and short-circuited the MacBook Pro's essential components. They quoted a hefty sum to fix the damage, which included replacing the logic board, keyboard, and other components. The Apple Service Center suggested they could try to fix the laptop, but there was a significant risk that the repair would fail, leaving me with no option but to replace the entire machine.

I was in a total fix. Replacing the entire laptop would put me out of pocket for several thousand dollars, and given the current global chip shortage, it could take weeks, if not months, to get my hands on a new laptop. I decided to explore other options.

After some research and discussion on Reddit, I found an excellent alternative. I heard about a company that specializes in liquid damage recovery and came highly recommended by other MacBook owners who had faced a similar issue. That company was Rossmann Repair Group, and they have their store located in New York.

I sent my laptop to Rossmann Repair Group, and after multiple diagnostic tests, they discovered the liquid spill had caused severe corrosion to the MacBook's keyboard and trackpad. They also noticed corrosion had spread to the computer's logic board, which was causing the fan to run overactive and slow down the computer's performance.

The engineers at Rossmann Repair Group did an excellent job of cleaning up the corrosion and replacing the MacBook's faulty components. They restored the machine to its former glory for a fraction of the cost that Apple had quoted. The MacBook Pro now runs smoothly and efficiently, and the fan is no longer making a loud noise.

In conclusion, if you ever spill liquid on your MacBook, take swift action to prevent damage to sensitive electronic components. As soon as possible, bring your laptop to a specialized liquid damage recovery center like Rossmann Repair Group, to have an expert assess the damage and work on repairs. It can save your MacBook from further damage and prevent you from having to invest in a brand new machine.

## Chosen Solution
 Had a water bottle next to my bed and accidentally knocked it over in the middle of the night onto my mac.
The following day I opened it up, my track-pad was over-responsive, wifi didn’t work at the time either.  Wifi and trackpad are working again since I let it air out. However, the slow processing speed has not changed.
There was some corrosion noted near the track pad connecter/cable on one side, otherwise there was no other obvious signs.
The fan is over-working also present on start up.
Can anyone point me towards some resources?  I am a novice with Mac repairs, however am comfortable replacing my own display for my iphone if this helps with my skill level.

 Hey Matthew,
Sounds like a Sensor is damaged. This causes the Computer to think its running a lot hotter than it actually is and throttles down the CPU and runs the fans high. You can use a Sensor Checking software to see what sensor it is.

If it’s the trackpad sensor you will have to deal with prying out the battery carefully for replacement, otherwise its going to be a Motherboard repair, it shouldn’t be too big of a deal for any repair shop offering micro soldering. As long as they know what they are doing :P
