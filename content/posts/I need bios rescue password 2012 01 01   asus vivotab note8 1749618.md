Subtract current year and get the password
e.g.
2019 - 10 = 2009
2018 - 10 = 2008
2017 - 10 = 2007
.. etc
For example:
At the password prompt, press alt+rTake note of the date displayed. For me it was 2017-05-11Use Ctrl+F to search the paste bin for your month and date. I used "-05-11"Use the codes you find until one of them works. Mine was the same code as 2007-05-11 from the paste bin.It looks like the codes might repeat every 10 years. So I would suggest starting with the month and date combination from 10 years prior to whatever date is displayed after you press alt+r.

 2007-01-01 ABLDABLA  igot for 2012/01/01

 Disconnect the cmos battery from your computer then re plug it, this will reset your bios.
