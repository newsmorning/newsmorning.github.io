Zombie Apocalypse Alert: Epic Dead Rising Franchise Resurrected for Xbox One and PC!

Breaking news for all fans of zombie-mashing and survival horror gaming: Capcom's beloved Dead Rising franchise is making a comeback! In an exciting new announcement, Capcom has revealed that the long-awaited Dead Rising 4 will be released on Xbox One and PC platforms on December 6th, 2016.

For hardcore fans of the series, this information alone is enough to spark a frenzy of excitement and anticipation. However, newcomers to the Dead Rising universe might be wondering what all the fuss is about.

In a nutshell, Dead Rising stands out as one of the most innovative and entertaining zombie-themed gaming franchises to hit the market in recent years. Set in a sprawling open world, the games invite players to explore a post-apocalyptic landscape filled with undead hordes, evil corporations, and quirky survivors with their own unique stories and quests.

What sets Dead Rising apart from other zombie games is its open-ended gameplay and countless customization options. As players progress through the story, they discover all sorts of crazy weapons and tools, from spiked baseball bats and chainsaws to explosive teddy bears and giant hamster balls. These items can then be combined and crafted to create even more insane and effective zombie-slaying tools.

But it's not just about killing zombies in Dead Rising. The series also features a robust crafting and leveling-up system, where players can upgrade their character's skills and inventories over time. This allows for a more immersive and personalized gameplay experience, as each user can approach the zombie apocalypse in their own unique way.

Of course, what really brings the Dead Rising experience to life is its signature sense of humor and outlandishness. From kooky costumes and absurd side quests to unintentionally funny dialogue and Easter eggs, the games never take themselves too seriously. There's always a laugh to be had or a surprise to be found around every corner.

With the forthcoming release of Dead Rising 4, fans can expect even more over-the-top action, humor, and horror. This latest installment promises to deliver some major upgrades and additions to the franchise, including new locales, weapons, characters, and crafting options.

To sum it up, the Dead Rising series is a true gem in the realm of gaming, and one that has earned a dedicated following among zombie enthusiasts and casual gamers alike. So mark your calendars, zombie hunters, because Dead Rising 4 is coming to haunt your Xbox One and PC screens this December!

We love zombies and the Dead Rising franchise, so knowing the entire collection is coming to the Xbox One, we’re overly excited. Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2, and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record are all coming to the Xbox One and PC.
 
When this happens, the Xbox One will be home to every game available in the Dead Rising franchise as Dead Rising 3 can only be played on the system and the next installment is exclusive for a period of time — probably an entire year.
 
The Dead Rising franchise has a very close relationship with Microsoft and the Xbox console. The first title in the series was an exclusive for the Xbox 360, and the third being a launch title for the Xbox One and still exclusive to this day.
 
Here’s what Capcom had to say in a statement to Eurogamer:
 
What does this mean for the future of Dead Rising?
 
Capcom will be bringing Dead Rising to Xbox One, PS4 and PC. In addition, Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record will make their way onto Xbox One and PS4. We will have more news to share soon.
 
Well, we doubt any other game in the franchise will be fully exclusive to the Xbox in the future. We say this because since Phil Spencer became the head of Xbox, he has been slowly doing away with paying third-party developers for exclusive rights to their games or timed exclusive rights to DLC. It’s the reason why Call of Duty is no longer associated with the Xbox when it comes to timed exclusive content and announcements.
