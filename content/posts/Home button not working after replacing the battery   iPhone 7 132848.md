You Won't Believe What Happened After I Replaced My iPhone 7 Battery - The Home Button Stopped Working!

As a proud iPhone owner, I always make sure to keep my device in the best condition possible. When my iPhone 7's battery life started to deteriorate, I knew it was time to replace it. I researched DIY options and decided to give it a shot. Little did I know, this decision would lead to an unexpected problem.  

After purchasing a replacement battery and carefully following a tutorial online, I was finally able to replace the battery. I charged the phone, turned it on, and was thrilled to see the new battery indicator. However, when I tried to use the home button, it wasn't responding. I turned the device off and on again, but still, the home button was not functioning.

As I researched online, I found out that replacing the iPhone battery could potentially cause issues with the home button. The home button on an iPhone 7 is attached to a small microchip that memorizes the button's unique fingerprint. When the button is removed, the microchip loses its memory, and the home button may stop working.  

While this was frustrating, I discovered that there were some workarounds to fix the issue. First, you could try a hard reset by holding down the home button and power button simultaneously for 10 seconds. If that doesn't work, there are apps that can create a virtual home button on your screen.  

However, if these options don't work, the best course of action is to take your phone to a professional repair store, where they can fix the home button along with any other issues you may have caused while changing the battery. 

In conclusion, replacing your iPhone battery can be a great way to extend the life of your device. But, it's important to know that it comes with some risks. Be sure to research thoroughly before attempting this on your own. And if unexpected issues arise, don't panic – there are always solutions out there. 

So, don't be afraid to try and save some money by swapping out your iPhone battery but be aware of the possible consequences, and proceed with caution.

## Chosen Solution
 My phone is a couple years old and my battery wasnt lasting half a day so i bought a 3rd party battery and followed the steps to replace it. The new battery works fine but immediately after restarting the phone I had a notification that the home button was disabled. Is this because it is a third party battery? Is there something i can do besides assistive touch?

 there are 2 cables coming from the screen that connect to the motherboard. one is for the screen one is for the home button.  the smaller one is for the home button. look carefully and see if theres a small tear in the cable. if there is a new screen should solve your issue.

 If you didn't touch any of the home button you've probably just ripped some of the cables for the LCD.
When you open up the iPhone 7 and insert a pick under the screen, there’s also a high chance you’ve nicked the home button cable itself. This is located under the small rectangular steel bracket at the bottom of the screen.
Remove the screen, remove this tiny bracket, disconnect the flex and check the point where it folds, there will likely be a tiny nick in the cable.
