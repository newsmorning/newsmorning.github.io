Unlock the Secret of Inelastic Demand: Learn How a Simple Curve Graph Can Save Your Business!

As a business owner, understanding the behavior of your customers when it comes to purchasing your products or services is crucial to the success of your venture. One of the critical areas that you must delve into is the concept of inelastic demand.

Inelastic demand refers to a scenario where the quantity of a product demanded remains relatively constant, irrespective of the price changes. Such a phenomenon occurs when the product has no close substitutes or when the product is viewed as a necessity. When the demand becomes inelastic, the business owner has a significant advantage because they can raise prices without affecting sales volume.

To get a better grasp of inelastic demand, you need to plot a curve graph representing the relationship between the price changes and the quantity of the product demanded. This graph typically forms a descending line, sloping from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.

On the graph, the vertical axis represents the price levels, while the horizontal axis signifies the quantity of the product demanded at that price. When demand is elastic, the curve is relatively flat, indicating that changes in price significantly affect the volume of sales. Conversely, an inelastic demand curve is steep, indicating that price changes do not significantly affect sales volume.

So, how can a business owner use this graph to improve their operations? First, business owners need to identify their products' demand elasticity levels. Suppose a product has an elastic demand curve, the business owner should be cautious when increasing prices as this can lead to a significant decrease in sales volume.

On the other hand, if the product demand curve is inelastic, raising prices may increase profits as the volume of sales remains relatively constant. Businesses should also strive to offer unique products or services with limited substitutes to increase customer loyalty and drive demand inelasticity.

In conclusion, understanding the concept of inelastic demand and using graphical representations can help business owners make informed decisions, increasing their profitability. By analyzing and identifying the demand elasticity levels, business owners can adjust prices accordingly and tailor marketing strategies to drive revenue growth. Armed with such knowledge, the potential for success only becomes greater as you unlock the secret of inelastic demand!

## What is Inelastic Demand?
 
Simply put, it points to the demand that cannot be influenced by changing prices. Price can increase or decrease, but the demand remains relatively the same. One of the simple examples is electricity, an increase in its price will not cause people to reduce their consumption level, and a decrease in its price will not make people use more.
 

 
### 
Key Takeaways

 
- Inelastic demand in economics refers to the phenomenon of insignificant or no change in demand in reaction to the change in the price of a product.Examples include the demand for necessities like gasoline, electricity, water, and food staples.If the price elasticity of demand is greater than one, then it is elastic. Whereas if it is less than one, then it is inelastic.A flatter demand curve is a characteristic of an elastic product. In contrast, a vertical curve indicates a perfectly inelastic product, and a steeper curve indicates an inelastic product.

 
### Inelastic Demand Explained
 
Inelastic demand is associated with necessary goods like water, fuel, and electricity; since these are part of daily lives, the level and pattern of their consumption do not align with the price change.
 
The formula for price elasticity of demand is used to determine whether the product has inelastic demand or not.
 
Price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded ÷ % change in price
 
Suppose the numerical value of price elasticity of demand derived by applying input values to the above formula is less than 1. In that case, the product is more inelastic, and if it is greater than one, the demand for a product is elastic. When it is less than one, it implies that the percentage change in price will only cause a small change in the quantity demanded. Furthermore, profit is optimized if the price elasticity is equal to one.
 
To find the income elasticity of demand, using the above formula, % change in income is applied instead of % change in price. For inelastic products, it will be zero or low in value. It implies that the quantity demanded will not rise or fall with an increase or decrease in income. Again, necessary or normal goods exhibit zero or low-income elasticity of demand.
 
### Inelastic Demand Curve/Graph
 
Drawing a demand curve helps understand the different types of elasticity of demand and add points to the elastic vs. inelastic vs. perfectly inelastic demand scenario.

- Perfectly inelastic: When the demand remains constant despite price fluctuations, it showcases a demand curve perpendicular to the x-axis representing the quantity. A demand curve in the form of a perpendicular line indicates that the product or service is perfectly inelastic. It also discloses that the slope is zero since the perfectly inelastic demand curve is a vertical line.Inelastic: Suppose a significant price change can cause a small change in the quantity demanded. In that case, the demand curve will not be vertical or perpendicular but steeper or almost perpendicular and have a greater slope.Elastic: If the product is elastic, the price change fairly influences the quantity demanded. The demand curve will be flatter and have a smaller slope.

 
So, a vertical demand curve is attributed to a perfectly inelastic product. At the same time, a steeper curve discloses that the product has a lower price elasticity of demand. Conversely, a flatter curve indicates the greater price elasticity of demand.
 
### Example
 
When Gasoline price increases, normally, there would not be a corresponding or significant decrease in the number of miles driven. Because of the inelastic nature of gasoline, the amount of gas people use is not negatively impacted by its price. Also, the common masses do not have many alternatives to travel to the workplace, transport their children, etc. Hence, the government must find a solution to reduce the price to ease the situation.
 
In the United States, in March 2022, the Biden administration announced the plan to release 1 million barrels of oil per day from petroleum reserve to increase the production of gasoline and a reduction in its price rise caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is because the increased supply of a product can reduce the price. However, the increase in supply and reduction in price depends on the amount of oil released.

It occurs when a price change causes no change in the quantity demanded. The perfectly inelastic demand curve is a line perpendicular to the x-axis denoting the demand.
 
Examples are generally discernable from the necessary goods like food staples, water, fuel, and electricity. Although these are integral elements in everyday lives, and consumers need these products and services in a reasonable quantity, an increase or decrease in their price will not make them consume more or less. For example, a high drop in the electricity price will not trigger people to use more electricity.
 
Elastic demand is associated with elastic products where the quantity demanded is sensitive to price changes. Therefore, the demand curve for elastic products is flatter and will have a smaller slope. Whereas for inelastic products, the quantity remains relatively constant and will have a steeper curve and larger slope. Examples of elastic products are clothing and electronics, and inelastic products are gasoline and electricity.
