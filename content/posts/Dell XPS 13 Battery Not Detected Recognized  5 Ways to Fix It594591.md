Is Your Dell XPS 13 Battery On The Fritz? Here Are 5 Foolproof Ways To Get It Recognized!

If you own a Dell XPS 13, you know how critical a functioning battery is for the usability of the laptop. However, just like any other laptop, your Dell XPS 13’s battery may also start to misbehave, causing you distress. In such cases, you must weigh your options and try to find a solution that works best for you. Here we have compiled a list of five ways to help you resolve your Dell XPS 13 battery issues.

1. Update Your BIOS

Sometimes, an obsolete BIOS can also prevent your laptop from detecting your battery, so you may want to try updating it. Visit the Dell Support website, enter your laptop’s model number or express service code, select Drivers and Downloads, and then the BIOS update. Before running the update procedures, make sure that your device is plugged in and that you have created a backup copy of all data. Keep in mind that if something goes wrong while updating BIOS, it may cause irreversible damage to your laptop, so proceed with caution.

2. Reinstall Battery Driver

If your Dell XPS 13’s battery is still not recognized, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the battery driver. You can do so by visiting the Device Manager on your computer and locating the battery driver, then right-clicking and selecting “Uninstall.” After that, click on “Scan for hardware changes” from the toolbar, and Windows will automatically reinstall the driver.

3. Power Cycle Your Dell XPS 13 Battery

Power cycling is a method that is often used to refresh the battery and remove any stagnant charge that may cause problems. Here’s how you can perform a power cycle:

Power off your laptop and unplug it from the power source.

Remove the battery from your laptop.

Press and hold the power button for 30 seconds.

Insert the battery back into your laptop and plug it in.

Power on your laptop, and the battery should now be detected.

4. Check the Dell XPS 13 Battery Health

A battery that has reached the end of its lifespan can also cause problems in a Dell XPS 13. If you have had your laptop for more than two years, you may want to check the overall health of your battery. You can use battery diagnostic tools such as HWMonitor or BatteryInfoView to check your battery’s overall health and performance.

5. Replace the Dell XPS 13 Battery

If you have tried all the solutions above but your laptop’s battery is still not recognized, you may have to replace your battery. You can purchase Dell XPS 13 batteries from various online retailers or directly from Dell. Before purchasing a replacement battery, make sure it is compatible with your laptop model.

This issue doesn’t necessarily mean that the battery is malfunctioning, which means that you can fix the device without taking it to a specialist. 
 
We’ll show you five methods that you can use to solve the problem, but first, you have to determine what caused the error.
 
## Why is my laptop not detecting the battery?
 
There are several issues that may cause the Dell XPS 13 battery to not be recognized, with the most prevalent being excessive heat. Charging or discharging the battery generates a lot of heat. 
 
If the chassis cannot cool down your device fast enough, the temperature will increase and damage the other components. 
 
All modern laptops are designed to automatically disconnect the battery if its temperature gets dangerously high.
 
Other than an internal malfunction of the battery, the only other cause for issues is software related. 
 
The motherboard of the XPS 13 interfaces with the battery to determine how much charge it has stored and how much power is drained at a given time. 
 
If the drivers or the operating system’s files contain errors, the battery won’t be recognized.
 
It is also possible for the battery to completely lose its ability to hold an electrical charge, or for its protection circuits to malfunction. 
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.
