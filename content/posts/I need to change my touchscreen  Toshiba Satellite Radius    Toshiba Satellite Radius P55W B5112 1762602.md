Are you one of the owners of a Toshiba Satellite Radius laptop and having trouble with the touchscreen? This can be a significant issue, especially if you rely on your device for work or personal use. However, before you panic and start shopping for a new laptop, there are a few things you can do to troubleshoot the problem.

Here are some common issues that users face with their Toshiba Satellite Radius touchscreen:

## The Touchscreen Isn't Responding

If you find that your touchscreen isn't responding or that you have to touch it multiple times to get a response, there could be a few reasons why. Firstly, it could be a software issue. Ensure that your laptop's operating system is updated to the latest version to fix any bugs or glitches that could be affecting the touchscreen.

If that doesn't work, try a hard reset of your device. This involves turning off the laptop, disconnecting it from any power source or peripheral devices, and removing the battery. After waiting a few minutes, reconnect everything and power on the device. This may help to reset the touchscreen.

## Touchscreen Stopped Working After Windows Upgrade

If your touchscreen worked fine before an OS upgrade, this could be because of compatibility issues. Some users report that Windows 10 updates have caused their touchscreen to stop working. The good news is that you can use the Windows troubleshooter program to resolve the error. Simply search for "troubleshoot" and click on "Find and Fix Problems With Your Computer's Power Settings."

## Vertical or Horizontal Lines on the Screen

If you're experiencing vertical or horizontal lines on your Toshiba Satellite Radius touchscreen, there could be a few reasons for this. Firstly, it could be that the screen is faulty, in which case you'll need to take it to a professional. However, it could also be a software issue. Try updating your OS to the latest version and checking for any driver updates that may fix the issue.

## Dead Spots on the Touchscreen 

If you have dead areas on your Toshiba Satellite Radius touchscreen or there are parts of the screen where touch response is erratic, it could very well be a hardware issue. In this case, you'll need to take it in to a professional to get it repaired or replaced.

## Conclusion

If your Toshiba Satellite Radius touchscreen is on the fritz, there are a few things you can do to troubleshoot the problem. If it's a hardware issue, you'll need to take it in for repair, but most of the issues can be resolved through software fixes. Before you decide to purchase a new laptop, give these troubleshooting solutions a try.
