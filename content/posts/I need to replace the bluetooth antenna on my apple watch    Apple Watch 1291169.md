# You won't believe how a simple fix can revive your Apple Watch: Replace the Bluetooth antenna now!

If you own an Apple Watch, you know how much of a lifesaver it can be. It keeps you connected to your phone, tracks your daily activities, and even reminds you to stand up and move around every once in a while. But what happens when your Apple Watch stops connecting to your phone? There are a number of potential problems that could be causing this, but one of the most common and easily fixable is a malfunctioning Bluetooth antenna.

The Bluetooth antenna on your Apple Watch is responsible for communicating with your phone, allowing you to receive notifications, make phone calls, and stream music without the need for a wired connection. If this antenna is damaged or not functioning properly, you may lose the ability to do all of these things, or experience other connectivity issues.

The good news is that replacing the Bluetooth antenna on your Apple Watch is a relatively simple and inexpensive fix that can breathe new life into your device. Here's what you need to know:

## How to identify a Bluetooth antenna issue

If you suspect that your Apple Watch may be experiencing Bluetooth antenna issues, there are a few signs to look out for. These include:

- Inability to connect to your phone or other Bluetooth devices
- Intermittent connectivity problems
- Slow or glitchy performance when attempting to use Bluetooth features
- Audio dropouts during phone calls or music streaming

If you're experiencing any of these problems, it's worth investigating whether your Bluetooth antenna may be at fault.

## How to replace the Bluetooth antenna

Replacing the Bluetooth antenna on your Apple Watch is a fairly simple process that can be done with a few basic tools. Here's what you'll need:

- A replacement Bluetooth antenna (these can be purchased online for around $10)
- A plastic opening tool or spudger
- A pair of tweezers
- A small screwdriver (often included in iPhone repair kits)

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Turn off your Apple Watch and place it on a clean, flat surface.
2. Use the plastic opening tool or spudger to carefully pry off the display from the casing. Start from the top left corner and work your way around the edge, being careful not to damage the display or other internal components.
3. Once the display is removed, you'll see the back of the watch and the battery. Use the tweezers to disconnect the battery by gently lifting up the ZIF connector located on the bottom right corner of the battery.
4. Locate the Bluetooth antenna, which is a small, rectangular piece of metal that's soldered onto the logic board. Use the small screwdriver to carefully unscrew the two screws that hold the antenna in place.
5. Use the tweezers to carefully remove the old Bluetooth antenna and replace it with the new one.
6. Reattach the two screws and carefully reconnect the battery by lowering the ZIF connector back into place.
7. Carefully align the display with the casing and press down around the edges to snap it back into place.
8. Turn on your Apple Watch and test the Bluetooth connectivity to make sure the new antenna is functioning properly.

## Conclusion

If you're experiencing Bluetooth connectivity issues with your Apple Watch, don't despair â€“ a simple fix may be all that's needed to restore its functionality. By replacing the Bluetooth antenna, you can get your watch back up and running in no time, without having to spend a lot of money or send it in for repairs. With a few basic tools and a new antenna, you can be back to enjoying all the features your Apple Watch has to offer.

## Chosen Solution
 The bluetooth antenna on my 42mm original series apple watch is broken and I'm looking for a replacement.  Ifixit has one for a 38 mm original series watch.  Will the 38mm antenna work on a 42 mm apple watch?  Do the holes match up the same on both models?

 Sorry they are different ;-{ You'll need to look for the larger watch part.
