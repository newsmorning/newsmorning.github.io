Find Out the Shocking Details Here!\nAs a proud owner of an iPod Touch 5th Generation, I admit that I was devastated when I accidentally dropped it on the floor. The impact was not too severe, but to my surprise, the home button stopped working. I couldn’t believe it! I tried pressing it several times, but it seemed like it had completely stopped responding.\nNow, you may be thinking that this is not a big deal, and I could just take it to an Apple store and get it fixed. However, that’s where the real shocker comes in. When I brought it to the store, I was told that the home button of the iPod Touch 5th Generation is not fixable. I was devastated!\nI couldn’t believe that a small drop could lead to such a big problem. I started to do some research and found out that this was not an isolated issue. Many iPod Touch 5th Generation owners have complained about the same problem after dropping their device.\nThe reason behind this is the design flaw of the iPod Touch 5th Generation home button. Unlike newer models, the home button is not a separate piece that can be easily replaced. Instead, it is attached to the device’s main board. Therefore, if it gets damaged, the entire device’s logic board must be replaced.\nThis news was hard to digest. I loved my iPod Touch 5th Generation, and I wasn’t ready to let go of it yet. I was hesitant to spend hundreds of dollars to replace it, but I didn’t have any other choice. Apple does not cover accidental damages under warranty, and since the home button could not be fixed, I had to buy a new one.\nSo, what are the lessons learned from my experience? First, always use a protective case to prevent damage in case you accidentally drop your device. Secondly, if you own an iPod Touch 5th Generation, be extra careful as it has a notorious reputation for home button failure.\nIn conclusion, my accidental drop led to a shocking revelation that my iPod Touch 5th Generation’s home button could not be repaired. If you own one, do everything you can to prevent accidental damage and take proper care of it. Don’t make the same mistake I did!\nChosen Solution I have a 5th gen iPod here that the guy dropped it and the home button stopped working, if you pull the screen off and manually push the button on the flex cable it works, but the home button itself will not actuate it at all. Any ideas?\nThere could be a possibility that part of the button located on the flex cable got damaged. Whereas you said it responds if you push the button on flex cable, I would verify the small black post located dead center is still intact. If not, a new flex cable assembly may be required shortly as that helps guide and maintain its function for shorting type of circuit that it is. If it is intact and not damaged the bracket that it is adhered to may have gotten bent down during the drop causing to large of a gap for the home key to make contact. With out risking damaging anything, sometimes the easiest fix is 1 or 2 small cut squares (no bigger than the button on the cable)of something like electrical tape on the button itself or in the center of the homekey. Best of luck and let me know how it works out if you haven’t already done something about it.\n","wordCount":"618","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alice Fernandez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-not-working-after-a-drop-ipod-touch-5th-generation-1407932/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't BELIEVE what happened to my iPod Touch 5th Generation after I dropped it - the home button STOPPED WORKING!
