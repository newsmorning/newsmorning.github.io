If you own a Hitachi TV, you may have experienced random crashes that can be annoying and confusing. You might have thought it's just a minor glitch that will eventually fix itself, but did you know that there could be a shocking reason behind it? 

Hitachi TVs have been around for decades, and they are known for their high-quality picture and sound. However, just like any other technology, they can develop problems over time. One of the most common issues that Hitachi TV owners face is random crashes. The TV turns off or freezes in the middle of watching a program, making it frustrating for the viewer.

The shocking reason behind this problem is related to the capacitors in the TV. In 2008, a large number of Hitachi TVs had faulty capacitors, which caused them to malfunction. This was not just limited to Hitachi TVs, but also affected other brands, including Samsung and LG. The faulty capacitors were produced by a company called Nichicon, which supplied capacitors to various TV manufacturers. 

The issue with these capacitors is that they were manufactured using a subpar electrolyte formula that caused them to dry out and eventually fail. This resulted in the capacitors overheating, which damaged other components in the TV, including the power supply board, control board, and mainboard. 

If your Hitachi TV is randomly crashing, it could be due to faulty capacitors. The best way to confirm this is to look at the capacitors and check if there are any signs of bulging or leaking electrolyte. If you're not familiar with TV repair, it's recommended that you contact a professional technician to fix the problem. Replacing the faulty capacitors will not only fix the random crashes but also prolong the life of your TV. 

In conclusion, if you're experiencing random crashes on your Hitachi TV, don't ignore the problem. The shocking reason behind it could be faulty capacitors, which can cause more damage to your TV in the long run. Contact a professional technician to get it fixed and enjoy watching your favorite shows without any disruptions.

 Hi,
I've got an hitachi tv model number l22dp04u a, and ive got an issue with that i cant seem to constantly replicate.
The TV will turn on a work as normal until a after a random period of time it will make the speakers pop then either a set of green and purple or 2 shades of grey lines will appear on the screen.
Unplugging the tv and and leaving it for a few seconds returns it to normal until it does it again after a random amount of time.
It seems to be worse once the TV gets warm but im struggling to get any ideas of what is going on, i have googled the issue but can't seem to find anything similar to the symptoms.
Anyone have any idea if its likely to be a main board or a psu board issue.
Regards
Ian

 @porkchopsachunk this "the speakers pop then either a set of green and purple or 2 shades of grey lines" would lead me to check the main board first. Of course there are still plenty of other possibilities and we would need to see what your boards look like etc. It probably overheats a component which then causes those issue. Possibly a voltage regulator or other IC on your board. Remove the back cover form your TV and look at the boards (don't touch just yet:-) see if you can find components that look discolored etc. Post some good pictures of your boards with your QUESTION.
