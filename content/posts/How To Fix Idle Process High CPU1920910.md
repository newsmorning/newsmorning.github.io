# Your Computer's Worst Nightmare Finally Solved: Say Goodbye to High CPU Usage with These Easy Steps!

We all know the frustration of having a slow computer due to high CPU usage. It can take forever to load a webpage, open a file, or even just switch between applications. But fear not, because there are some easy steps you can take to solve this problem and bring your computer back up to speed.

Firstly, you need to identify the culprit that's causing the high CPU usage. To do this, open up the Task Manager on your computer and click on the Processes tab. Here, you'll be able to see which programs or services are using the most CPU power. If you see an application that you don't recognize or don't need running, you can stop it by right-clicking on it and selecting "End task".

Another solution to high CPU usage is to reduce the workload on your computer. This might mean closing unnecessary applications, trimming down your browser extensions, or even changing your browsing habits. For example, if you have a lot of tabs open in your browser, try closing some of them to reduce the strain on your CPU.

If you're still experiencing high CPU usage after trying these steps, it might be time to upgrade or replace some of your computer components. This could mean increasing your RAM, upgrading your processor, or even buying a new computer altogether.

Lastly, you should always make sure that your computer is running at optimal performance. This means keeping your system up to date with the latest updates and patches, as well as regularly scanning for viruses and malware. You can also run performance optimization applications to keep your computer running smoothly.

In conclusion, the problem of high CPU usage can be a frustrating one, but it's not one that you have to live with. By following these simple steps, you can solve the issue and bring your computer back up to speed. So, say goodbye to slow load times and hello to a fast and efficient system!

Restart your system and open the task manager to find the Idle process running 100% CPU usage? Thinking about what to do about it? Checked for background apps or programs, couldn’t find anything there? Want to know what is using your CPU resources? Don’t worry! This post will learn what has caused the system Idle to process high CPU usage in your system and how to get rid of it to keep your computer healthy.
 
First, let us know what it is.
 
### What is the System Idle Process?
 
System Idle Process CPU high usage is defined as the CPU resources that are not being used. In other words, it is a process where the CPU is not in demand with any running program, but still, it shows as a high percentage in Task Manager. It should only show 100% CPU usage when your computer runs programs that require a high percentage of CPU processes like playing games. When this fails to occur, the system Idle process CPU high usage shows up in Task Manager.
 
### How to Check CPU usage?
 
When you are running other programs and applications on your system, the computer is very slow. You open the Task Manager to check which is taking up so much of the CPU usage if it indicates that even when other programs have been running, the IDLE process shows the maximum percentage for CPU usage.
 
This is your cue to understand that the system has to be fixed from the system idle process. As you can see, the CPU demands a function to provide the space needed by the computer. But if it carries on with the Idle process, it is wrongly shown because a computer isn’t idle.
 
## How to Fix Idle Process High CPU?

When you see an Outdated Status, you need to click on Update All, which is profitable as it updates all device drivers. The outdated drivers take much of the space and thus make the computer slow. It is also the cause of the System Idle Process CPU high usage as the communication is not well received by the system.
 
Follow the steps to get most of the Advanced Driver Updater.
 
Step 1: Download Advanced Driver Updater from the link below:
 
Step 2: Install and run it successfully.

Step 4: The scan takes place for a few moments, and the result will show as Drivers updated.
 
Step 5: Once the scan is complete, restart the computer.
 
Step 6: Go to Backup and create a backup file for all the device drivers. The backup will help in the future if any of the device drivers fail to work or are incompatible with your device.
 
Recheck the Task Manager, and you will see the changes. The System Idle Process does not show the high percentage of the CPU used while being idle.
