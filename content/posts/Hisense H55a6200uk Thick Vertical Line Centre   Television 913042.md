Title: You Won't Believe What's Ruining Your TV Experience! Is Your Hisense H55A6200Uk Plagued by a Mysterious Thick Vertical Line? Click Here to Find Out Why and How to Fix It!

Introduction:

Have you ever experienced a mysterious thick vertical line on your Hisense H55A6200Uk TV screen? If yes, then you are not alone. This problem can be frustrating, and it can ruin your TV watching experience. In this article, we will explore what causes this issue and how to fix it.

Body:

Before we dive into the solution, let us first understand what causes the thick vertical line on a TV screen. The most common cause is a faulty T-con board. The T-con board is responsible for translating the information from the main board and sending it to the LCD screen. When the T-con board malfunctions, it can cause a thick vertical line on the screen.

Another possible cause is a damaged or faulty LCD panel. If the panel has been damaged or has a manufacturing defect, it can appear as a thick vertical line on the screen. Lastly, a loose or damaged cable connection between the T-con board and the LCD panel can also result in this issue.

So, now that we know what causes the thick vertical line on the Hisense H55A6200Uk TV screen, let us discuss how to fix it. The first step is to check if the issue is with the T-con board. If it is, then replacing the board is the solution. You can find replacement T-con boards online or at a local TV repair shop.

If the issue persists despite replacing the T-con board, then the problem could be with the LCD panel. In this case, replacing the panel is the solution. However, replacing an LCD panel can be expensive, and it is not recommended if the TV is past its warranty period.

Lastly, check the cable connections between the T-con board and the LCD panel. Ensure that the cables are tightly connected and undamaged. If there is any loose or damaged cable, replace it and check if the issue is resolved.

Conclusion:

A thick vertical line on the Hisense H55A6200Uk TV screen can be a frustrating issue. However, we hope this article has shed some light on the possible causes and solutions for the problem. Remember, if the issue persists despite following the above steps, it is best to consult a professional TV repair technician. Happy TV viewing!


## Chosen Solution
 Hi fault as title above, thick vertical line in the centre of TV, I've changed the TCON board but it hasn't fixed the problem, is there any point in changing the main board? Thanks.

 either a ribbon cable came loose or it got damaged. you will need to check which.

 @gibbsy what you have here is a disconnected ribbon that enters the LCD from the LCD driver board. Those ribbons are attached via a special process. Gently push on the ribbon cables that enter the LCD right where the fault is. If it changes the line you know the issue is the separation of the ribbon cable from the LCD. If it does not then it “could” be originating from LCD driver board. That is the board that connects to the LCD screen. WE would need to get the manufacturer number or any other identification on this, so we could try and check for some schematics. Let us know what exact panel your TV has. There is a label on the back of the panel that will have all the information on it. None of this will be easy to do and it will require a complete disassembly. If you want to give it a try, post some really good pictures of that board with your QUESTION so we can see what you see and hopefully help you further. If you feel it’s to much or to far out, replacing the LCD will be the only other option. Panels that size are not easy to come by and will most likely cost more than a new TV. Adding images to an existing question

 Hi old Turkey I'm going to upload some pics of the layout of the TV,  just the boards on the chassis I'm not even sure if there is a board behind the panel, I seen someone strip down a TV, to get to the led backlights, is there a board even further behind than that, doesn't seem there would be much room. So uploading the pics to let you see, I know the repair shop said it was those ribbons, but is there a possibility the main board could be causing the fault? The picture with all the boards isn't great, but I've broke it down a bit, and you can see the yellow ribbons the repair shop was referring, they look like they just connect to the LCD so not so sure there's another board in play, but hope you can see the long thin one I spoke about in previous posts, Thanks.
