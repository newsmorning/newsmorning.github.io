# You Won't Believe What Happened When This iPhone 7 Was Lightly Dropped - It Stopped Recognizing Keypresses!

Have you ever dropped your iPhone and felt your heart sink as you picked it up again, hoping that it has survived unscathed? As much as we try to be careful with our phones, accidents can happen and they can cause unexpected and frustrating problems.

Recently, a friend of mine experienced just such a problem with her iPhone 7. She had accidentally dropped it from a height of about a foot and a half onto a carpeted floor. At first, the phone seemed to be working fine, but she quickly noticed that it wasn't recognizing her keypresses properly.

At first, she thought it was just her imagination, but as she tried to type messages and emails, she found that she was constantly making mistakes, and that her phone was registering her taps and swipes very sluggishly or not at all. It was as if the phone had developed a sudden and inexplicable case of amnesia - it just couldn't remember how to respond to her touch.

Naturally, she was concerned about what had happened to her phone and whether it could be fixed. She took it to an Apple Store and explained the problem to the tech support staff there. They were able to replicate the issue and determined that the touchscreen had been damaged during the drop. They recommended a repair or replacement of the affected parts.

This experience highlights the fragility of modern smartphones, which are packed with advanced technology but are also highly sensitive to even minor bumps and jolts. While Apple has made great strides in making their phones more robust and resilient, they are still much more prone to damage than older, simpler devices.

It also underscores the importance of taking precautions to protect your phone from accidents whenever possible. Simple actions like keeping your phone in a protective case, avoiding carrying it in your pocket with keys or coins, and handling it with care can go a long way in preventing damage.

In conclusion, if you're ever in doubt about the condition of your phone after a fall, it's always better to err on the side of caution and bring it in for evaluation. Don't make the mistake of assuming that minor damage won't cause significant problems - you never know what may be going on inside your phone until you have it examined by a professional. And remember - no matter how tough your phone may seem, it still needs your help to stay safe and functional for as long as possible.

## Chosen Solution
 Accidentally dropped my iPhone now I cant press anything on it. Cant unlock it either. the buttons and the home button works. I tried restoring in DFU mode but it didnâ€™t do anything.

 What could have happened is you damaged the LCD  aka the touch screen,  even though the iphone 7 is known for many issues, mainly audio, from the sounds of it, i believe you damaged the lcd which you will need to replace
