Revolutionary InDriver Launches in Nigeria, Offering You the Power to Negotiate Your Ride Prices!

InDriver, the international ride-hailing service, has launched in Nigeria, and it is changing the game for passengers who are tired of feeling powerless in their ride-hailing experience. The new service is touted as a revolutionary concept that allows passengers to negotiate ride prices with drivers, putting the power back in the hands of consumers.

InDriver's move into the Nigerian market comes at a time when ride-hailing services are struggling to cope with the financial realities of the region. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a drop in demand for ride-hailing services globally, and Nigeria has been hit hard by the economic impact of the outbreak. In response, InDriver has devised a pricing model that is flexible and puts more money in the pockets of both riders and drivers.

The concept of InDriver is simple. To avail yourself of the service, you download the app for free and create an account. When you need a ride, you enter your destination and your desired fare. The app then sends out a notification to drivers in your area, and interested drivers will offer their own price for the ride. You then choose the driver based on factors such as price, driver rating, car type, and pickup location. With InDriver, you are in control of the negotiation process, and you get to decide which driver you want to work with.

InDriver's pricing mechanism is based on a proprietary algorithm that takes into account a range of factors to determine the fare for a ride. These factors include the time and distance of the trip, the driver's rating, and the number of rides available in the area. Riders can either accept the price offered or negotiate with the driver for a more favorable rate.

Drivers also benefit from InDriver's model as they can receive a significant portion of the fare charged, unlike in traditional ride-hailing services. InDriver takes a commission of less than 10% of the total fare, which translates to higher earnings for drivers. This is a win-win situation for both drivers and riders, as drivers can earn more while offering affordable rides, and riders can choose the best fare that suits their budget.

InDriver offers an additional level of safety to its users through its unique customer rating system. Both drivers and riders are rated by each other after every ride, and users can view the ratings of the driver and the car before they confirm their trip. The system also offers an in-app messaging feature that allows passengers to communicate directly with drivers and share real-time pickup and drop-off location, ensuring that riders arrive at their destinations safely and efficiently.

InDriver's entrance into the Nigerian market presents significant opportunities for both drivers and riders. With its innovative and flexible pricing model, customers can save money and enjoy a seamless ride-hailing experience. As Nigeria continues to evolve as an emerging economy, InDriver's concept is well-suited to the needs of a young, urban and tech-savvy population, and is expected to help the country leapfrog into the forefront of the ride-hailing industry.

In conclusion, InDriver's entry into the Nigerian market is a game-changer in the ride-hailing industry. The app's transparent pricing model, flexibility, and safety features offer substantial benefits to riders and drivers, and it is set to revolutionize the way Nigerians travel. This is most definitely the start of better things to come!

In Nigeria, good old price bargaining was the norm before ride hailing became a thing. As a commuter, you have to miss the old culture of negotiating fares when it comes to booking rides. The absence of being able to use phrases like ‘can I pay’, “this is how much I have’ or in the local dialect, ‘se ko gba’ is something we all miss in the ride hailing world. But wait, you can only miss something that is not there. That’s right, you can now negotiate the price of your fare with inDriver – a ride hailing platform that offers another dynamics to booking rides in the modern world.

The ride hailing company is currently in operation in Lagos only for now where you have Bolt, Uber, Oga Taxi and several others. However, to book a ride, you just have to enter your current location and destination as well as the price you’re willing to pay. This will be seen by drivers close to you, who can then decide to confirm your order or offer a counterbid. You see, good old haggling! After agreeing on a price, the driver comes to pick you up and then you can pay in cash or bank transfer as there is no in-app payment.
 
From a user perspective, inDriver gives more power in terms of being able to suggest a price and negotiate fares instead of just paying a certain specified fee.  Also, drivers will be able to suggest a more suitable fee depending on traffic and other factors that might be in play at the time which makes it a win-win for both parties.
 
inDriver is among the top 10 ride hailing apps by download and launched operation in Africa last year and currently present in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria.
