## Chosen Solution
 I need to bet a replacement  adapter for my  iPhone thomas kinkade  train Christmas tree

 Hi,
The Christmas tree can operate on 3 x AAA batteries which means that it operates at 4.5V DC.
Try using an adjustable, multi voltage power adapter (example only) where you can select the 4.5V DC output and it also comes with a range of plug adapter sizes so that you can get the correct one to fit the connection in the device as I donâ€™t know what the correct size may be.
