Introduction
Have you ever noticed that your iMac display is flickering on the left side? It's a common issue that most users face. Don't worry, the problem is fixable! However, it's essential to understand the reason why Safe Mode works while Standard Mode fails.

Understanding the Issue
The iMac is an amazing device that helps users with a lot of things. However, it's prone to several issues, including display problems. Flickering on the left side of the iMac display is a typical issue for users. The flickering may happen spontaneously or when you try to open an application. It's not always a big problem, but it can be annoying for users. The question is, why does it happen on the left side?

The Shocking Reason why Standard Mode Fails
First things first, it's important to understand that the OS X software controls your display. That's why most of the display issues are related to the software, not hardware. When your iMac starts up, it initializes all the software required for the display to work in Standard Mode. However, some software that is required for the display to work correctly might get corrupted. It may be due to bugs, power surges, or an improper shutdown.

That's where the shocking reason comes into play. When you start up your iMac in Safe Mode, the system only loads the essential software. Hence, if the issue is related to a corrupted software, it'll not come into play in Safe Mode. The iMac starts in Safe Mode with limited options and disables some tasks that may cause software conflicts. Therefore, Safe Mode works, but Standard Mode fails because of the disabled software that causes the flickering on the left side.

Fixing the Issue
Now that you know the reason, let's dive into how you can fix the issue. If the left side of your iMac display is flickering, the first thing you should do is restart your iMac while holding down the shift key. This will start up your iMac in Safe Mode. Once your computer is in Safe Mode, you should test whether the flickering remains. If it's gone, then there's nothing wrong with your computer's hardware, and the issue is caused due to corrupted software.

In this case, to fix the issue, you should boot into Standard Mode and delete some of the software. The software may include third-party applications or something that you installed before the display problem occurred. You can also check the startup items in your System Preferences to see if any apps could cause software conflicts. If you can't find the issue this way, you should go for a full restore or consider contacting Apple support.

Conclusion
Flickering on the left side of your iMac display can be annoying, but it's fixable. The issue may be related to software conflicts and corrupted files. Safe Mode works, but Standard Mode fails due to disabled software. Restart your iMac while holding down the shift key, and test whether the flickering remains. Once confirmed, follow the steps above to fix the issue, and you're good to go!

## Chosen Solution
 Trying to save this one for a kid.  Even with the CCFL out it is usable.  Plulled the HD (it had been upgraded to 2TB), wiped the drive and installed a clean system of El Capitan on a MacPro.  The Pro (2008) runs fine using the drive as an external,
Booting iMac from an external enclosure, Machine boots fine in Safe Mode but not standard mode. (I get a multicolored dotted display with a black box.  Does anyone know what to pull out of the library to get it not to check the display so it can be used again.

 I think your facing a SATA I/O issue here the ST2000DM001 is a SATA III (6.0 Gb/s) drive, this system only offers a SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) interface. Depending on which version you will have either a ATI Radeon HD 4670 or Radeon HD 4850 GPU, but when you are running in Safe Mode this series uses the Intel EFI driver in compatibility mode. with is why it works in safe mode.
Try a known SATA II drive to see what it does.
