It's not uncommon for a Macbook Pro to experience overheating issues, especially the Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012. However, recent reports have pointed out that some users are experiencing high CPU temperatures while their laptops are idle, which is causing concern. Are these high CPU temperatures while idle a sign of disaster? Let's find out.

First, let's delve into the hardware components of the Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012. This model features an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 4GB or 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and an Intel HD Graphics 4000 GPU. While this was a powerful machine at the time of its release, it's not uncommon for it to struggle with demanding apps and activities in 2021.

High CPU temperatures while idle could indicate a problem with the thermal paste or thermal management system within the Macbook. When your Macbook Pro gets too hot, it can cause damage to internal components, leading to decreased performance or even hardware failure.

There are a few things you can do to help mitigate the issue of overheating. Firstly, you should ensure that your Macbook Pro has good airflow around it. You can do this by using a cooling pad or elevating your laptop while in use. Secondly, you can optimize your Macbook's energy settings to reduce the load on the CPU.

To adjust your energy settings, go to the Apple Menu > System Preferences > Energy Saver. From there, you can adjust the display and sleep settings to ensure that your Macbook is optimized for power efficiency.

If you're still concerned about the high CPU temperatures, you can use a utility such as iStat Menus to monitor your Macbook's internal temperature. This will give you a better understanding of when your Macbook is running hot and when it's running cool.

Conclusion

While high CPU temperatures while idle are not necessarily a sign of disaster, they can be indicative of a problem with your Macbook Pro. If you're experiencing overheating issues, take steps to improve the airflow around your laptop and optimize your energy settings. If the problem persists, it may be worth getting in touch with Apple support to seek out a hardware solution. Ultimately, taking care of your Macbook Pro can help prolong its lifespan and ensure that it continues to perform well for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I have Arctic MX-4 on this computer.
I have TG pro and Macs Fan Control. TG Pro is a little confusing and honestly it doesn’t work better than Macs Fan Control.
So I have replaced the thermal paste twice with the same paste now. I’m having like a hard time to make this time stay under 65C when browsing the internet using Safari. Im thinking about using Grizzly’s Kryonaut.
What’s the regular temps for this thing? I not sure if my heatsink has gone bad. Maybe?
I made sure that to tighten the screws correctly on his heatsink. Maybe I should buy new paste and a new heatsink and see what’s up.
What do you guys recommend?

 Turn of the pc and remove heat sink and fan. Carefully clean heat sink as well as fan with iso-propyl. See this guid for cleaning : https://www.ifixit.com/News/36877/ask-if....
Let it dry completely and use metallic paste on it. A good heat sink paste contains tiny metal particles to absorb and transfer the heat.
