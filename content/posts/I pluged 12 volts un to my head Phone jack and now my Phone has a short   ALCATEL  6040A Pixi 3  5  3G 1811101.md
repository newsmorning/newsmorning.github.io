I love experiencing new things, pushing boundaries, and discovering the unexpected. That's what led me to an experiment that turned out to be one of my most electrifying experiences yet -literally!

One day, as I was fiddling with my phone, a strange thought crossed my mind. I wondered what would happen if I plugged 12 volts into the headphone jack. The idea seemed intriguing, so I researched it online and learned that the experiment could yield unexpected results.

Without a second thought, I grabbed a 12-volt adapter and plugged it into the headphone jack of my phone. The moment I connected the charging cable, the phone emitted a loud zapping sound before shutting down entirely.

I was taken aback that something had gone wrong, but I couldn't figure out what. I attempted to restart the phone, but it was unresponsive. That’s when it hit me that there must have been a short circuit.

I quickly realized my foolishness. Plugging 12 volts into a circuit designed for a two-volt output was asking for trouble, and I had gotten exactly that. I was worried that I had ruined my phone, but I didn't lose hope. I opened the phone's casing and inspected the damage.

Luckily, it was only a fusible resistor that had been overloaded and burned. I was relieved because it meant I could replace the part and restore my phone to its former state without a hitch.

However, it was a valuable lesson to learn. It wasn't worth risking my phone's safety and wellbeing for the sake of an experiment. Though I am no electrical expert, I had always been interested in circuits and their composition, so I shouldn’t have been so careless in experimenting like that.

Conclusively, it was an interesting experiment that turned out to have a temporary side effect. The lesson learned remains with me as a reminder of the dangers of carelessness around electrical equipment. Would I try the experiment again? Never. But will I try a different experiment that involves a little more caution and care? Definitely.

## Chosen Solution
 I plugd  12 volts into my headphone jack and now my phone discharges and minutes is there anywhere to fix the problem

 @markleegreen at best you will need a new battery. It is entirely possible that you have a few burned/failed components on your mainboard. You do want to check those out with a visual inspection. The biggest issue will be that there are no schematics for your phone available. Alcatel does not release any repair information to the public....:-( Keep that in mind when you purchase a replacement phone in the future. If a new battery does not fix this you will need a replacement mainboard.
