## Chosen Solution
 Htc phone I need to identifie it., it says inside model : meid, mnd or mdn, etc..I think? It seams to be a battery that plugs in with ribon cable , the phone is uper and lower white plastic and middle silver metal with metal kick stand

 Does it have a red kickstand? It's most likely a HTC Evo 4G LTE from Sprint.
