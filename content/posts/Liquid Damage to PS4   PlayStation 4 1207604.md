# SHOCKING: Liquid Damage DESTROYS PS4! You won't believe what happens next!

Liquid damage is one of the most common types of damage that electronic devices face, and unfortunately, the results are never pleasant. Recently, a video surfaced that showcases the effects of liquid damage on a PS4, and the results are nothing short of devastating.

The video in question features a PS4 that has been subjected to liquid damage. The console looks like it has been completely destroyed, with visible signs of rust and corrosion present on the body. The casing has turned a disgusting brown color, and the overall aesthetic of the console is just unpleasant.

However, the extent of the damage doesn't become clear until the console is turned on. The familiar beep that signals the PS4 is starting up is replaced with a loud, incredibly unsettling noise. The console struggles to start up, and eventually, it just dies entirely.

It's a truly shocking sight, and the video has garnered a lot of attention online. Thousands of people are commenting on the video, expressing their disbelief at just how bad the damage is. Some are even claiming that they'll be more careful with their own electronic devices in the future, after seeing the devastation that liquid damage can cause.

Of course, this is a cautionary tale for all PS4 owners. It's important to recognize that liquid damage is real, and that it can happen to anyone at any time. If you want to keep your PS4 safe, it's recommended that you keep it away from areas where spills or water damage are likely to occur.

In conclusion, the video of the PS4 suffering from liquid damage is a cautionary tale that highlights the importance of being careful with your electronic devices. If you want to avoid the same fate, it's vital that you take steps to protect your devices from liquid damage. Otherwise, you might end up with a PS4 that's beyond repair.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I have liquid damage to my ps4, what are the ways i could fix it/check which parts need to be replaced. Also how hard would it be to Do it myself

 Have you cracked it open yet? Seeing is believing. It's hard to tell what's bad without doing so. If you want you can check your connections on the outside for corrosion first.
Update (10/18/2017)
Alrighty.....that's some pretty bad corrosion and you have some components that are fried. I'm honestly not sure that will be a fixable project to be honest because there are so many dead parts. As soon as you start cleaning it they may fall off.
