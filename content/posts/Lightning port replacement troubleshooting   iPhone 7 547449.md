# Is Your iPhone 7's Lightning Port Giving You a Headache? Click Here to Find Out How to Fix It

As an iPhone 7 user, you may be experiencing issues with your device's lightning port. This port is the primary way you connect your phone to charge it or to transfer data to and from your computer. If your lightning port is not working correctly, it can be frustrating and inconvenient.

In most cases, the problem with your iPhone 7's lightning port is related to debris buildup. This can occur due to daily usage, and dust, lint, and other small particles can accumulate inside the port, blocking the connection between your iPhone and the lightning cable.

The good news is that there are several ways to fix the problem – you don't necessarily need to take your phone to an Apple store. Here are some solutions you can try at home:

## 1. Clean the Lightning Port using a toothbrush

One simple solution to unclog your iPhone 7's lightning port is to use a toothbrush. Simply turn off your phone, grab a soft-bristled toothbrush, and gently brush the port area. This should remove any dirt or debris that may be causing the connection issue.

## 2. Use a Compressed Air Can

Another way to clear out debris from your iPhone 7's charging port is to use a can of compressed air. You can purchase a can of compressed air from your local electronics store or online. Use the straw attachment to direct a blast of air into the port to dislodge any debris. Be careful not to hold the can too close to your phone while spraying.

## 3. Use a Paperclip

If the toothbrush and compressed air methods don't work, you can try using a paperclip. Straighten out a paperclip and use it to gently scrape out any debris that may be trapped inside the port. Be careful not to damage the pins inside the port or push debris further into the port.

## 4. Update your iPhone 7's software

Sometimes, the lightning port issue could be due to outdated software. Updating your iPhone's software can fix some of the issues that may be causing the charging port to fail. Go to Settings > General > Software Update to check for available updates.

## 5. Contact Apple Support

If none of the solutions above works, the last resort would be to visit an Apple store or contact Apple Support. There may be a hardware issue or a problem with the charging port's internal connector, which only Apple can fix.

Conclusion

If your iPhone 7's lightning port is giving you a headache, there are ways to fix it. Begin by using a toothbrush or a can of compressed air to remove any debris or lint buildup. You can also use a paperclip to gently scrape out any trapped debris. Ensure that you don't push debris further into the port or damage the pins during the cleaning process. If none of these methods works, contact Apple Support or visit your local Apple store for assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 My phone was only charging in a certain position for about 3 months, until it finally would not charge. I tried cleaning out the lightning port to no results. So, I decided to replace the lightning port. I feel as if I did all of the steps correct, but now even when the phone is on a charger, the battery dead -charge the phone symbol comes on. Could this be an issue not of the charging port, or what would go wrong to make that happen… any suggestions should I just buy a new phone :(

 You missed a little information to tell if it shows lighting bolt(electric symbol for charging) or not
If it shows the problem may be related to charging MOSFET, connector,USB ic or charging ic.so take it to technician
If no lighting bolt the issues might be connector
Before all try another charger with USB cable then try to connect with both side of USB cable
