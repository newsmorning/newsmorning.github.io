# iPhone 5 Users Beware: Your Home Button Could Be Possessed!

If you are an iPhone 5 user, then you should be aware of the latest trend in the tech world that is causing panic amongst the users. Reports have been flooding social media websites and tech forums about the Home button on iPhone 5 being possessed. It might seem unbelievable, but users have complained about their Home button making random movements and activating features without their control. 

The issue has been reported by a considerable number of iPhone 5 users, and while some have reported the issue happening occasionally, others are dealing with it almost every day. The issue is not limited to any particular version of iOS, and users with different models of iPhone 5 are also facing the problem. While Apple has not addressed the issue officially, some users have found workarounds that have helped them to get rid of the problem temporarily. 

One of the workarounds is to press the Home button and the lock button simultaneously and hold for a few seconds. This will restart your phone, and the problem might go away. Some users have also suggested cleaning the Home button with a soft cloth or using a canned air duster to clean any debris that might be stuck in between the button. 

However, these workarounds are only temporary, and the problem might still come back. The real issue lies in the hardware of the phone, and only Apple can address it. Some users have taken their phones to the Apple store, and their phones were repaired, but others have been charged for the repair, even though the issue was not their fault. 

The iPhone 5 was released in 2012, and while it might seem old, many users still rely on it as a secondary phone. If you are an iPhone 5 user and are facing this issue, then you should be cautious while using your phone. The possessed Home button might lead to accidental dialing, launching an app or sending a text, which might cause inconvenience or embarrassment. 

In conclusion, the iPhone 5 users should be aware that their Home button might be possessed and causing them trouble. While some temporary workarounds might help, the real issue lies in the hardware of the phone, which only Apple can fix. If you are facing this issue, then you should take your phone to an Apple store and get it fixed if you want to avoid any inconvenience or embarrassment.

## Chosen Solution
 So... I have an iPhone 5 with a home button problem.  I pre-ordered this when the iPhone 5 was released, so it's out of warranty by now.
The problems started happening around September and I sent it in for warranty repair in October.  The device worked well for about a month or so, then toward the end of November it started doing the exact same thing.  Now it's December, and I'm using a back-up iPhone 4 until I either figure this out or scrap the device for parts and wait for whatever 2014 brings us for iPhones..
I can leave it sitting on the table and Siri will randomly activate.  I can also try pressing the home button and it will do nothing or register a triple-press.  When I hit the power button on top of the device, it will randomly take screenshots.
The behavior is leading me to think that it is constantly registering my home button as being held down for some reason.
My first approach to the situation was to address the mechanical function and replace the home button and the home button cable.  After replacing those parts, my iPhone 5 is still misbehaving.
Is there anything else which could be a mechanical factor contributing to this behavior or is there anything software-related which I could also attempt?
I've already attempted a factory restore, and it's running current iOS 7.0.4...

 Seems like you have tried all the obvious fixes first.  The problem may be on the Logic Board where the Home Button makes contact with the Logic Board.  Has this device suffered water damage?  I would take the device apart and focus on that area where the home button communicates with the logic board and try cleaning that area thoroughly with Alcohol.  You may have some debris in there thats jamming the contact up.

 The is an easy test and solution.
Remove three screws on battery connector. Unplug the charging port connector (not the battery). After that leave it for a while to see if its doing the same thing.
If it stops doing that just change the whole charging port assembly. Costs $7 i guess.
Charging port assembly has microphone, speaker, antenna, headphne jack and home button connectors in it.
If its doing the same thing after disconnecting the charging port connector it may have mainboard problem (water damage).
Good luck ...

 i have tested this on many devices and found that . the two gold prongs which is connected to home button flex cable , when these two prongs touches the home is automatically been pressed without tapping the button. so please replace your gold prongs are allign properly  to get it fixed.

 Change the charging port the two  gold prongs on it are proporly malfunctioning

 could u solve the problem patnodewf ?? am going crazy and dont know what to do ..
please tell me what did u do about it

 Hi Layla it's either a faulty home button or faulty dock..
If you release the screen from the frame so the home button is not pressing against the docks gold prongs see does it still activate Siri. If not it's most likly the home button that's faulty..
If it activates Siri when the screen is lifted up of the frame then it's most likely the dock that's faulty..
You can unplug the dock if this is the case to rule out hardware damage

 thank you con ... i don't think i can do it myself ... i'll ask for help

 sometimes this happens beacuse of cold weather. i dont know why, but it just happens. i suggest taking it to apple or putting a little heat on it with something slightly warm.

 This is a problem of water damage or some debris is out there
Same thing happened with my phone
And I cleaned the dock part with alcohol and now it's working fine
Best of luck

 Since this has killed me for 3 days I figured i'd try to help anyone who got stuck in my situation. If it the button keep activating after installing the digitizer the issue is a grounding short circuit. In my case the ipad worked great until you installed the digitizer back on the unit and sealed it then the random presses started. Turned out to be the ribbon cable for the home button has an exposed gold strip. The home button in this A1489 is soldered to the digitizer and only one plug links them to the board. I covered the strip past the home button all the way to the end of the digitizer with Kapton tape and have not had a problem since.
