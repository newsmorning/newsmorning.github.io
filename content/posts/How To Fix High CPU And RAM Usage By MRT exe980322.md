# Is Your Computer Running Slow? Here's the One Secret Solution to Fix High CPU & RAM Usage by MRT.EXE!

If you're reading this, chances are you're dealing with a slow and sluggish computer. It's frustrating to deal with a computer that takes forever to load programs and keeps freezing up. The culprit of this problem could be MRT.EXE, a Windows process that scans your machine for malware and malicious software. While this process is essential for protecting your computer, it can also cause high CPU and RAM usage, which in turn slows down your computer. But fear not! There is one secret solution to fix the issue, and we're here to explain it to you.

Before we dive into the solution, it's essential to understand what MRT.EXE does and why it's causing high CPU and RAM usage. MRT.EXE (Malicious Software Removal Tool) is a process that runs in the background on your computer to scan and remove any malware or malicious software. This tool is included with Windows and is updated every month to ensure the latest threats are detected and removed. While this is a useful tool to have, it can take up a considerable amount of your computer's resources, causing high CPU and RAM usage.

The good news is that you can stop MRT.EXE from running and causing your computer to slow down. The solution is simple and effective – you need to disable the scheduled scan that Windows performs. By default, Windows runs a scheduled scan of your computer every month, which is what is causing the high CPU and RAM usage. By disabling this scan, you can free up your computer's resources and speed up its performance.

To disable the scheduled scan, follow these steps:

1. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.

2. Type "taskschd.msc" in the dialog box and press Enter to open Task Scheduler.

3. In the left-hand pane of Task Scheduler, expand Task Scheduler Library > Microsoft > Windows > Malware Protection.

4. Click on the "Microsoft Malware Protection" task in the center pane.

5. In the right-hand pane, click on "Properties."

6. Click on the "Triggers" tab.

7. Select the "Monthly" trigger and click "Edit."

8. Uncheck the "Enabled" checkbox and click "OK."

9. Click "OK" to close the "Properties" window.

By following these steps, you've successfully disabled the scheduled scan, which means MRT.EXE will no longer cause high CPU and RAM usage. You can always manually run a scan using Windows Defender or any other antivirus software you might have installed.

In conclusion, if you're struggling with a slow and sluggish computer, don't panic. High CPU and RAM usage caused by MRT.EXE are common issues that can be fixed with a few simple steps. By disabling the scheduled scan, you can free up your computer's resources, speed up its performance, and keep it protected from malware and malicious software. We hope this article was helpful, and your computer is running smoothly again!
