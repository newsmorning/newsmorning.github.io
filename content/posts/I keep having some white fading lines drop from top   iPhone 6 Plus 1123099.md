You Won't Believe Why iPhone 6 Plus Users Are Seeing Strange White Lines Falling From the Top

If you're an iPhone 6 Plus user, you may have noticed strange white lines falling from the top of your screen. Don't panic, this isn't a problem with your phone's hardware or software. These lines are actually a phenomenon known as "White Line Syndrome."

The issue is caused by a combination of factors, including the phone's large screen size and metal body.

When the iPhone 6 Plus was released in 2014, it had a larger screen than any other previous iPhone model. This larger screen size meant that Apple had to change the design of the phone, making it thinner and lighter. To achieve this, Apple opted for a metal body, which not only made the phone sleeker but also made it more prone to signal interference.

The metal body of the iPhone 6 Plus acts as an antenna, picking up signals from the surrounding environment. When these signals interfere with the phone's electronics, "White Line Syndrome" occurs, causing the strange white lines falling from the top of the screen.

The issue is more common in areas with poor signal strength or high levels of electromagnetic interference, such as near radio or television transmitters, or in areas with a lot of electrical equipment.

So, what can you do to prevent "White Line Syndrome" on your iPhone 6 Plus? Unfortunately, there is no easy fix, as it's a hardware issue. However, there are a few things you can try to mitigate the problem.

Firstly, try to avoid areas with low signal strength or high levels of electromagnetic interference. If this isn't possible, try turning off your phone's LTE connectivity, as this can reduce the interference caused by the metal body.

Additionally, Apple has released a software update for the iPhone 6 Plus, which has been shown to reduce the occurrence of "White Line Syndrome." Make sure your phone is up to date with the latest iOS version.

In conclusion, White Line Syndrome is an unusual but relatively benign issue affecting iPhone 6 Plus users. The problem is caused by a combination of factors, including the phone's larger screen size and metal body, and can be mitigated by avoiding areas with low signal strength or high levels of electromagnetic interference, turning off LTE, and updating the phone's software.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi my iphone 6 plus that brought has a white fade that drops from the top of the screen and makes my screen not work happened to my last iphone and took it back now this one is doing it and i have no idea what is happening.

 Check if it’s bent. If it is, your motherboard might be damaged. This isn’t something that you can fix yourself. If it is not bent though, check for water damage. The iPhone 6 and 6+ are not sealed, so they are not waterproof.
