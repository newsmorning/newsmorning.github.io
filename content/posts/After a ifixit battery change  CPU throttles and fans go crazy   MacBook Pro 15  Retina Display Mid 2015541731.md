WARNING: Macbook Pro Users! If You've Ever Considered DIY Battery Replacement, Here's What You NEED To Know!

Macbook Pro laptops are known for their sleek designs, powerful performance, and long-lasting battery life. However, like all rechargeable batteries, your Macbook Pro battery will eventually wear out and require replacement. While it may be tempting to do the battery replacement yourself, there are several risks involved that could result in unforeseen consequences.

Before you decide to take on the DIY battery replacement task, here are a few things you should know.

1. The Warranty will be voided:

The warranty that comes with your MacBook Pro covers several components of your device, including the battery. If you decide to replace the battery yourself, you will automatically void the warranty of your device. If any other issues arise, you will be on the hook for the full cost of repairs.

2. The Difficulty Level is High:

While there are several online guides available to assist you in the replacement process, it is important to note that the difficulty level involved is high. The MacBook Pro is designed with intricate pieces and, if done incorrectly, there is a risk of damaging the device or even injuring yourself.

3. Old vs. New Battery:

When purchasing a replacement battery, keep in mind that not all batteries are created equally. While the new battery may look the same as the old one, there is a possibility that it may have been manufactured using substandard components. If installed, this cheap battery could lead to severe damage and even fires.

4. Risk of Fire and Explosion:

One of the biggest risks involved with DIY battery replacement is the possibility of fire and explosion. Lithium-ion batteries, such as the one in your MacBook Pro, are known to be volatile and can easily ignite if not handled properly. The process of replacing a battery involves removing and replacing the old one, which increases the chances of improper handling, leading to thermal runaway and ultimately fires.

5. Apple Store Battery Replacement:

In light of the risks involved in self-replacement, Apple offers its own battery replacement service at its stores. While this may seem like an added expense, it comes with its own benefits. Firstly, it saves you from doing the potentially dangerous replacement process yourself, and secondly, the replacement will come with a new warranty.

In conclusion, while DIY battery replacement may seem like a cost-effective solution, it is critical to understand the potential risks involved. While the process may be simple, the consequences, if done incorrectly, can be severe. It is always recommended to seek professional assistance from authorized Apple stores, as self-replacement is never worth the risks involved.

## Chosen Solution
 hi everyone,
I replaced my battery after 8 years of using the macbook. everything seemed to work fine, and i was pretty confident that i didn't destroy any connectors while taking out the logic board and everything according to the repair manual.
well, after all it appears it did break something. others had this problem after a battery change as well, some fixed it by looking for loose connectors, but mine all look pretty well, as far as I can tell. Resignated I brought the Macbook into a Apple repairshop, but of course they denied even looking at it, after telling them that I had replaced something myself. I am a bit desperate now, as it was still running pretty well and I was hoping to use it for some more time. Now I am wondering if anyone here has an idea what I can try, because with the blocked CPU it is pretty much unusable.
TB Pro is reporting an issue with the hard drive temperature sensor, even though SSD1 and SSD2 temps look good to me. I noticed that the GPU has some very short 90C peaks, but then quickly returns to ~28C.
Anyone an idea what i can try, check or look at at this point, or a software way to block out the SMC throttling. I read there used to be options to do this, but don't seem so with newer macOS' (using Monterey), also I am not expirienced with any github things.


Thank you in advance!
Sebastian

 mmm â€¦ often we get a second error. So we either have a bad battery or the trackpad thermal sensor is acting up.
