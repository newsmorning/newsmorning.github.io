## Chosen Solution
 I recently had a customer that brought me a SM-T230NU tab 4 with a damaged charge port, and apparently the customers daughter didn't know that you can't just force in a charger and shorted the board, so I replaced the charging port and it turned on for a few seconds then it started to reboot every 3 seconds for 12 seconds before shutting down completely and now it doesn't show any signs of life , I am hoping that the problem is a resistor but I cant find a scamatics anywhere

 I will search the samsung database for you. Give me an hour and ill report back with results.
Edit: OK unfortunately I couldn't find any for this model.

 i have my samsung galaxy tab 4 2 years ago, recently it cant be turn on after charge,it only flash the log and disappear immidately. not sure why and how to fix it.
