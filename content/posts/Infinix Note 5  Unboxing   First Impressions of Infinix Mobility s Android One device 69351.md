Title: Unbelievable! Discovering the Exciting First Impressions of Infinix Note 5 Box and its Incredible Android One Features

Are you ready to be blown away by the incredible Android One device, Infinix Note 5? Well, we sure were when we opened the Infinix Note 5 box and discovered its amazing features such as the Android One, related updates and excellent performance. In this article, we'll take you through our first impressions of the smartphone and why it's worth the investment.

First off, we were impressed by the beautiful body design of the Infinix Note 5. It boasts of a 5.99-inch Full HD+ display with 18:9 aspect ratio, slim bezels, and good color reproduction. The glass back which has sloping edges makes the phone sleek and comfortable to hold in the hand. The device is light and feels premium.

Infinix Note 5 runs on Android One, a new experience for Infinix Mobility that ensures a faster, smoother, and efficient operating system. An Android One device means users get timely and consistent updates with Android operating system updates for 2 years and security updates for 3 years. This is fantastic news for Android enthusiasts who desire to keep their phones updated and secured for a considerable period.

The Infinix Note 5 also features Artificial Intelligence or AI. It employs AI to enhance user experience in various ways. For example, AI-enabled camera stabilizes photos and videos resulting in a good quality output irrespective of the environment the image is shot in. AI also helps with better battery management by predicting app usage and optimize the battery life accordingly. It monitors and controls the smartphone's performance, learns about user habits and anticipates behavior to eliminate "lagging" and enhance device efficiency.

The AI camera is another highlight of the device. It comes with a 12-megapixel sensor on the rear, which captures clear images with excellent color reproduction, even in low light conditions. The front camera sports a 16-megapixel sensor, which takes great selfies with its "bokeh effect." This feature blurs the background for a more professional portrait image.

Infinix Note 5 also has a fast charging capability. It has a 4500mAh battery which supports the 18W fast charging to make life easier for users. The device powers up quickly so users can continue using it without disruption.

In conclusion, we were quite impressed with the Infinix Note 5 device. The first impressions it had on us were incredible, and we couldn't believe all that came inside of the box. From the slim design, Android One, AI features to the fantastic camera and charging capability, Infinix Mobility has outdone itself once more with this device. It is the perfect choice for individuals seeking affordability, uniqueness, and quality from their smartphones. We highly recommend it.

Infinix Note 5 Unboxing: In the words of Marlon Brando in the Godfather franchise, Infinix just made you an offer you can’t refuse. The Infinix Note 5, which made its global debut in Dubai, is yet again of the proud beneficiaries of Google’s Android One project. Android purists must be giddy with excitement at this announcement.
 
If I lost there for a moment, here’s a bit of a backstory. The Android One project was started in 2014 with the sole purpose of shipping pure, unadulterated and unmodified Android devices. The hardware and software stringent standards followed are those laid down by the mighty Google.
 
The reasoning behind this is to provide a consistent user experience across the board. The Infinix Hot 2 became the first Android One smartphone in Africa at the time.
 
The Infinix Note 5 promises a nitrous boost in performance and overall system optimisation. What’s more, there’s barely any bloatware to speak of, other than a few essential Google apps we just can’t do without. We found this very intriguing, given the time and effort Infinix put into developing their XOS custom skin alongside other X-apps such as X-Hide, X-Theme, X-Club and others.
 
So we did some poking around and we have to admit, it’s an interesting device from the get-go. Have a look at our hands-on first impressions of the Infinix Note 5 and what we think about it.
 
##  Infinix Note 5 Unboxing
 

 
The first thing that catches your eye with the Infinix Note 5 is the ‘Android One’ label on the device box. There’s perhaps no better anointing than a validation from none other than Android itself. In one fell swoop, Infinix gets street credibility and a chip on its shoulder, which is no mean feat. For this reason, congratulations are in order for a job well done.
 
Before we even open the box, we get to know a thing or two about the device within from the information kindly printed outside:
 
- 32GB ROM and 3GB RAM (another variant has 64GB ROM and 4GB RAM)
 - 18:9 aspect ratio on a 6 inch Full HD Infinity Display
 - 12MP Rear Camera and a 16MP Front Camera for Low-light Selfies
 - A 4500mAh battery for 3-Day battery life
 - An Octa-Core CPU with 2.0 GHz clock rate
 - X-Charge
 - Free one-time upgrade to the latest Android version

 
## What’s in the box

## Infinix Note 5 Hands-on First Impressions
 
At first blush, the Infinix Note 5 unboxing brings to mind the flagship Samsung Galaxy ensemble in look and feel. But no, it does also look like a quintessential Infinix handset as any we have ever held and reviewed. The device is slick and ergonomic in all the ways its predecessors, the Note 4 and Note 3 were not. You have the round edges, an 18:9 aspect ratio and a 2.5D screen to thank for that.
 
We were struck by how much screen Infinix managed to fit into the frame to render the Note 5 almost bezel-less. By our rough estimations, you get about 90% screen to body ratio. We know this has become the norm with newer releases, but the thing is, we just can’t yet enough of it. The rounded edges add to the premium finish and they are just as gorgeous. From what we saw, split screen works wonderfully, as does watching movies, playing games and overall phone usage.
 
Let’s move onto other areas on the device. As expected, the placement of the individual features is pretty much a textbook affair. The fingerprint is centred at the upper extremes at the back. As for the camera and LED flash, they call the top right corner home. On the right edge, you will find the SIM and SD card rack, volume and power buttons.
 
Topside, you will find a well-positioned earpiece straddling the front camera and a flash to the other side. And LED indicator resides there somewhere too but is only visible when you get a notification message. The bottom of the devices houses the speaker, Micro-USB slot, microphone and 3.5 Audio jack. Like we said, pretty much textbook.
 
The back of the device sports a gorgeous glossy polycarbonate sheen which Infinix calls Metal print. Marketing buzzwords aside, the Note 5 gives off some serious premium vibes. I wouldn’t be surprised if anybody mistook this for a Galaxy Note. And yeah, it’s that good-looking. The Infinix blood is strong.
 
We will have a more in-depth look at all the Infinix Note 5 has to offer in later posts. From the little we have seen, the front and rear cameras look promising and there’s talk they use AI to do some fancy stuff. For this and more, stay tuned. Let’s leave you with the specifications and where you can buy the Note 5.
