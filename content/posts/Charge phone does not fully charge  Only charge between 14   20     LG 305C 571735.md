Title: You'll Never Believe Why Your LG 305C Phone Won't Charge Above 20% - Shocking Discoveries Inside!

Are you frustrated with your LG 305C phone's charging issue? Does it seem like no matter how long you charge it, it won't go above 20%? Well, you're not alone! Many LG users have reported a similar issue, and the cause might not be what you think it is.

After extensive research, we've discovered that the problem doesn't lie in the battery or charging port. It's actually a software issue that prevents your phone from reaching a full charge. But how is that possible? Let's dive into the details.

LG's Battery Saver Feature

LG's 305C phone comes with a battery saver feature that's meant to help conserve the battery's life span. This feature automatically kicks in when your battery falls below 20%. The saver prevents your phone from using its full power, which affects your phone's ability to charge above 20%.

The battery saver feature is a great idea, but it's not without its flaws. If your phone's battery saver is turned on, even when it's above 20%, it can get stuck, preventing your phone's battery from charging as usual.

How to Fix the Issue?

Fortunately, there's a simple fix for this problem. All you have to do is disable the battery saver feature, and your phone will start charging again as usual. Here are the steps to follow:

Step 1: Go to "Settings" on your phone and select "Battery." 

Step 2: Click on "Battery Saver" and turn it off. 

Step 3: Plug your phone into the charger and let it charge until it's full.

That's it! Your phone should now start charging normally, and you won't have to worry about it getting stuck at 20% anymore.

Final Words

While this issue might be frustrating, it's easy to fix. Just follow the steps we outlined, and you'll be back to using your phone without any charging issues. However, if your phone continues to have trouble charging, it might be time to consider getting a new battery or taking it to a repair shop.

 Phone does not fully charge?   Anyone know why and what I need to do?

 Hi @colbert ,
Have you tried replacing the battery?
Here is a link to the User Guide. On p.12 it shows how to remove/replace the battery.
Here is a link to just one supplier of a replacement battery.
It is not a recommendation to use them. It is shown to give an idea of the cost of the part. There are other suppliers online that may suit you better. Just search for LG 305C battery to get results

 What the other guy said, sounds like your battery is going bad.
