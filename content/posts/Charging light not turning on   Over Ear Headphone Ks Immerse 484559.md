Title: SHOCKING REVELATION: Charging Light on KS Immerse Over Ear Headphones WON'T TURN ON! Find Out Why...

Introduction:

Do you own a KS Immerse Over Ear Headphones and have been struggling to charge them lately? The charging light on the headphones won't turn on, and you're losing out on the fantastic music experience? Don't panic! You're not alone. Many users are facing similar issues with their headphones. But what causes this problem, and how can you fix it? Let's find out.

Body:

Firstly, the reason behind the charging light not turning on is straightforward. Your headphones are either not connecting well to the charger or aren't charged enough to show a light. Therefore, it's best to plug the charger in the right way and wait for the device to charge.

If the headphones still won't charge despite plugging in the right way, your charger could be faulty. Inspect the charger for damages or a short-circuit that may have occurred. If you're sure the charger is faulty, replace it with a new one. If you're unsure whether the charger is functional or not, try it on another device to confirm.

Another reason the charging light may not turn on is because of a dead battery. The lifespan of a headphone's battery usually depends on usage time and frequency. A battery that has been fully discharged or maintained without frequent usage for a long time may die off. In this case, it's recommended to replace the battery with a fully functional one.

Lastly, the charging port on your headphone could also be damaged, resulting in the charging light not turning on. Use a flashlight to check the charging port for any damages or debris that may cause a malfunction. You can clean it up or replace the port if it's necessary.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the reason for the charging light on KS Immerse Over Ear Headphones not turning on could be due to various reasons, including faulty chargers or dead batteries. By using the tips provided above, you can quickly identify the problem and solve it in no time. Always remember to maintain and use your headphones correctly to prevent such issues from occurring again.

## Chosen Solution
 I have the Ks Immerse noise cancelling wireless headphones and since yesterday the charging light is not coming on. At first I thought maybe the light just wasn’t working but they were charging and today when I used them, after about 5mins they told me the battery was low and needed charging. The light is still not coming on after doing a reset and trying different cables and charging points. I’ve only had the headphones for about 18 months and looked after them properly and up till now they have worked brilliantly. 
Does anyone have  any suggestions as to how I could fix it?
Thanks!

 @kitten1877 double check your warranty. see if this is still covered. It could be the cable connector or even just the battery. But I would hate for you to go through this if you still have some kind of warranty on this.
