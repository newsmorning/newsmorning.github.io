If you’re a business owner or you’re learning about finance, then you’ve probably heard about the income statement. This financial statement shows you how much revenue you’ve generated and how much you’ve spent to generate it. It’s a critical document that helps you understand your company’s financial health and make informed decisions.\nBut while it’s easy to read an income statement, calculating the individual items can be daunting if you’re not familiar with the formula. In this article, we’ll take you through the secret formula for calculating income statement items with an example, so you can learn how to boost your finances:\nThe Income Statement Formula The income statement is broken down into several categories of items, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses. Each category has its formula for calculating the item.\nExample: Calculating Revenue Let’s start with revenue, which is the total amount of money your business has generated from selling goods and services. The formula for calculating revenue is:\nRevenue = Quantity Sold x Price per Unit\rFor example, let’s say you’re running a coffee shop, and you sell 500 cups of coffee for $2.50 each. Then your revenue would be:\nRevenue = 500 x $2.50\rRevenue = $1,250\rExample: Calculating Cost of Goods Sold The next item on the income statement is the cost of goods sold, which is the cost of producing the goods you’ve sold. The formula for calculating cost of goods sold is:\nCost of Goods Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\rFor example, let’s say you’re running a grocery store, and you have $10,000 worth of goods at the beginning of the year. Over the year, you purchase $50,000 worth of goods, and at the end of the year, you have $20,000 worth of goods remaining. Then your cost of goods sold would be:\nCost of Goods Sold = $10,000 + $50,000 - $20,000\rCost of Goods Sold = $40,000\rExample: Calculating Operating Expenses Operating expenses are the costs of running your business, such as rent, salaries, and utilities. The formula for calculating operating expenses is:\nOperating Expenses = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs\rFor example, let’s say you’re running a bakery, and your fixed costs are $5,000 per month, while your variable costs, such as ingredients and wages, are $2,000. Then your operating expenses would be:\nOperating Expenses = $5,000 + $2,000\rOperating Expenses = $7,000\rExample: Calculating Net Income Net income is the bottom line on your income statement. It’s the amount of money you’ve earned after deducting all your expenses. The formula for calculating net income is:\nNet Income = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses\rFor example, let’s say you’re running a pizza shop, and your revenue for the year is $100,000. Your cost of goods sold is $30,000, and your operating expenses are $50,000. Then your net income would be:\nNet Income = $100,000 - $30,000 - $50,000\rNet Income = $20,000\rConclusion Now that you’ve seen the formulas for calculating income statement items, you have a better understanding of how your business finances work. By tracking your income and expenses, you can make better-informed decisions about your company’s future.

This income statement formula calculation is done by single or multiple steps.\nIn the case of a single step, the income statement formula is such that the net income is derived by deducting the expenses from the revenues. Mathematically, it is represented as,\nNet Income = Revenues – Expenses\nIn the case of multiple steps, first, the gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods soldCost Of Goods SoldThe Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is the cumulative total of direct costs incurred for the goods or services sold, including direct expenses like raw material, direct labour cost and other direct costs. However, it excludes all the indirect expenses incurred by the company. read more from revenues. Then the operating income is computed by deducting operating expensesOperating ExpensesOperating expense (OPEX) is the cost incurred in the normal course of business and does not include expenses directly related to product manufacturing or service delivery. Therefore, they are readily available in the income statement and help to determine the net profit.read more from gross profit, and finally, the net income calculation is done by adding operating income and non-operating items.\nIncome Statement Formula is represented as,\nGross Profit = Revenues – Cost of Goods SoldOperating Income = Gross Profit – Operating ExpensesNet income = Operating Income + Non-operating Items The income statement formula under the multiple-step method can be aggregated as below,\nNet income = (Revenues + Non-operating items) – (Cost of goods sold + Operating expenses)\nYou are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Income Statement Formula (wallstreetmojo.com)\nExplanation of the Income Statement Formula Example of Income Statement Formula (with Excel Template) Firstly, the profit and loss statement has to note the total of all the revenue-generating sources. Next, determine the cost of goods sold from the profit and loss account. The cost of goods sold primarily includes raw material costs. In this step, the gross profit can be calculated by deducting the cost of goods sold from the revenues. It is as shown below: Gross profit = Revenues – Cost of goods sold Next, the operating expenses are also collected from the income statement. Operating expenses primarily include selling expenses, administrative expenses, etc. In this step, the operating income can be calculated by deducting operating expenses from the gross profit, as shown below. Operating income = Gross profit – Operating expenses Next, determine the non-operating items such as interest income, one-time settlements, etc. Finally, the net income calculation is done by adding the net of non-operating items (= non-operating income – non-operating expense) to the operating income, as shown below. Net income = Operating income + Non-operating items Gross profit = Revenues – Cost of goods sold\nOperating income = Gross profit – Operating expenses\nNet income = Operating income + Non-operating items\nBelow is data for the calculation of Apple Inc.’s annual report.\nGross Profit\nTherefore, Gross ProfitGross ProfitGross Profit shows the earnings of the business entity from its core business activity i.e. the profit of the company that is arrived after deducting all the direct expenses like raw material cost, labor cost, etc. from the direct income generated from the sale of its goods and services.read more can be calculated as,\nGross profit = Net salesNet SalesNet sales is the revenue earned by a company from the sale of its goods or services, and it is calculated by deducting returns, allowances, and other discounts from the company’s gross sales.read more – Cost of goods sold\n= $215,639 Mn – $131,376 Mn\nGross Profit for 2016 will be –\nGross Profit for 2016 =$84,263\nOperating Income\nTherefore, Operating Income can be calculated as,\n= $84,263 Mn – $10,045 – $14,194\nOperating Income for 2016 will be –\nOperating Income for 2016 = $60,024\nNet Income\nTherefore, Net Income can be calculated as,\n=$60,024 Mn + $1,348 – $15,685\nNet Income for 2016 will be –\nNet Income for 2016 =$45,687\nSimilarly, we can calculate gross profit, operating income, and net income for 2017 \u0026 2018, and also, you can refer to the below given excel template for the same.\nRelevance and Use of Income Statement Formula Understanding the income statement formula is very important for people interested in actively trading in the stock market or analysts who investigate a particular company’s financial performance.
