# Stop the Buffering Madness! Discover 5 Genius Ways to Fix Fubotv for Uninterrupted Streaming Bliss!

Buffering, the bane of every streaming enthusiast's existence. You start to watch your favorite show on FuboTV, only to see the annoying buffer symbol, and suddenly your video comes to a halt. Buffering is very frustrating and can ruin your streaming experience, but it doesn't have to be that way. In this article, we will show you five genius ways to fix FuboTV for uninterrupted streaming bliss.

## First things first: Check Your Internet Connection!

Before we dive into our tips and tricks, it's important to ensure your internet connection is stable. FuboTV requires a minimum of 15 Mbps internet speed for streaming, and if your connection is not stable, you may experience buffering issues. To test your connection, you can use any online speed test tools like speedtest.net, fast.com, or dslreports.com. If your internet speed does not meet or exceed the minimum recommendation, you should try resetting your router or upgrading your internet plan.

## Optimize Your Device

Another factor that can cause buffering when watching FuboTV is poor device performance. If your device is not optimized, it may not have enough processing power to handle high-quality streaming. Here are some ways to optimize your device:

* Close all other open tabs, apps, or programs that could be slowing down your device.
* Clear your device's cache and cookies periodically.
* Update your device and FuboTV app to the latest version.
* Restart your device before streaming.

## Adjust the Stream Quality

The high-quality streaming of FuboTV is fantastic unless you experience buffering. If you're experiencing buffering, you might want to reduce the stream quality. Here's how to do it:

* Open your FuboTV account settings.
* Click on Video and then select the Quality option.
* Choose a lower quality option such as 720p or Standard Definition.

Reducing the quality will not only reduce buffering issues, but it will reduce data consumption as well.

## Utilize an Ethernet Cable

Wi-Fi can be a significant cause of buffering for FuboTV, so switching to an Ethernet cable can potentially reduce buffering. Ethernet cables provide a more stable and faster connection without the potential for interference.

## Use a VPN

Most internet service providers (ISPs) can throttle or slow down the speed on specific websites or services like FuboTV. A virtual private network (VPN) can solve this problem while also providing privacy and security. A VPN will mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic, making it difficult for ISPs to throttle your connection or track your online activity.

In conclusion, buffering issues when streaming FuboTV are frustrating, but there are several solutions. By optimizing your device, reducing stream quality, or using a VPN, you can enjoy uninterrupted streaming bliss.


A buffering wheel may appear briefly at the start of a stream. If this happens frequently or in the middle of a video stream, it could indicate that your Internet speed and strength are poor. 
 
## The fuboTV buffering issue may be due to your Internet connection
 
- If fuboTV keeps buffering when you're trying to watch your favorite show or game, the situation can become frustrating.
 - Buffering issues may be caused by an unreliable Internet connection, temporary bugs, or the device's hardware being used to stream.
 - We have five solutions to fix this problem and a few pointers on how to improve your streaming quality.

 
This slowdown occurs when multiple devices, such as phones, laptops, game consoles, or tablets, share a single internet connection. 
 
You will need to troubleshoot the problem and fix your fuboTV when it keeps buffering even after trying other fixes. 
 
When you’re eager to watch a movie or TV show, the annoying spinning circle or arrow that indicates buffering is the last thing you want to see.

## Why is fuboTV constantly buffering?
 
You can consider these factors:
 
 
 
Browse the web from multiple devices with increased security protocols.
 
Access content across the globe at the highest speed rate.
 
Connect to thousands of servers for persistent seamless browsing.
 
- Slow Internet connection – Although fuboTV will adjust the video quality to match your connection speed, a slow Internet connection may cause the app to buffer continuously
 - Router problems – If your router is not set up correctly or has some issues, your connection may be inconsistent or too slow; try restarting or reconfiguring it
 - The video resolution is too high – Forcing the resolution to Full HD or 4K with a slow Internet connection may bring the streaming to a halt

 
Before starting any troubleshooting, make sure that your Internet connection speed is on par with fuboTV’s requirements:
 
As you may clearly see, the higher the resolution, the faster your Internet connection speed should be. Check the information provided by your ISP and see if they match.
 
To check your Internet connection speed, you may use a third-party service like Ookla’s Speed Test website.
 
Quick Tip
 
A solution for preventing or solving streaming buffering is using a reliable VPN service. ExpressVPN can help you enhance your viewing experience by reducing lag and bypassing bandwidth throttling by your internet source. 
 
This VPN also keeps your online activity more private and secure, as your connection is safeguarded with tunneling and encryption, thus third-parties like ISPs are powerless to inspect your data packets. 
 
## How do I stop my fuboTV from buffering?
 
### 1. Check the fuboTV server status
 
Sometimes, the fuboTV servers may be down or in maintenance so the first step would be to verify the service status.
 
###  ExpressVPN

FuboTV has a dedicated page to check the status of its services so that should be an easy task.

First, all the streaming apps buffer the video before playing it so the action itself is perfectly OK. The problem comes when the buffering can’t keep up with the viewing.
 
Here are a few pointers on how to improve the streaming quality:
 
➡ Use a cable connection – By using an Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi, you can considerably improve the quality of your live stream because the Internet connection will be a lot more stable
 
➡ Limit background tasks – Numerous apps are continuously running in the background of every computer and some of them use the Internet connection so close as many as you can
 
➡ Close unused tabs – If you’re watching fuboTV in your browser, close the tabs you’re not using at the moment because they may use your precious Internet connection
 
That’s it! We hope that now the fuboTV buffering issue has been solved and now you can watch your favorite shows.
