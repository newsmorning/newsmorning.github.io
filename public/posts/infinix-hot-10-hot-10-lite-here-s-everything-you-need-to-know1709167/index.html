Discover the Ultimate Guide to Infinix Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite - Your Game-Changing Smartphone!\nMobile phones have revolutionized the way we live and communicate with each other. With the advent of smartphones, their role has broadened beyond mere communication devices. Smartphones are now used for entertainment, gaming, social media, and even work. And the Infinix Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite are making waves in the smartphone market.\nThe Infinix Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite are budget-friendly smartphones targeted at those looking for affordable yet powerful devices. These phones feature impressive specifications that make them the perfect choice for gamers, video streamers, and social media enthusiasts.\nDesign \u0026 Build\nBoth the Hot 10 and Hot 10 Lite feature beautiful and sleek designs. The Hot 10 is available in three beautiful colors – Obsidian Black, Moonlight Jade, and Ocean Wave. The Hot 10 Lite, on the other hand, is available in four beautiful colors – Obsidian Black, Amber Red, Moonlight Jade, and Ocean Wave. These colors are not just beautiful but also give the devices a striking and captivating look.\nDisplay\nThe Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite both have a 6.6-inch HD+ Infinity-O display that delivers an immersive viewing experience. The screens offer sharp and vivid colors and are perfect for streaming videos or playing games. The devices have slim bezels that further enhance the viewing experience.\nPerformance\nThe Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite are equipped with 5200mAh batteries, which last long due to their power optimization technology. They run on the Mediatek Helio G70 processor and have 3GB RAM and 64GB internal storage, which can be expanded up to 256GB via MicroSD. These specifications ensure that the phones run fast and smoothly.\nCamera\nThe Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite have an AI-powered quad-camera setup, which includes a 16-megapixel primary sensor, a 2-megapixel macro lens, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and an AI camera. The devices also have an 8-megapixel front camera with a dual-LED flash. These cameras capture sharp and detailed photos with accurate colors, as well as decent selfies.\nFeatures\nBoth the Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite have unique features that set them apart from the competition. The Hot 10 has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication and also supports face unlock. It also features DTS Audio Processing, which gives an immersive sound experience.\nThe Hot 10 Lite, on the other hand, has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is a rarity in modern smartphones. It also has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication.\nConclusion\nThe Infinix Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite are game-changing smartphones that offer a lot of features for a budget-friendly price. They are perfect for gamers, video streamers, and social media enthusiasts who are looking for an affordable yet powerful smartphone. With their sleek designs, powerful specs, and unique features, the Infinix Hot 10 \u0026 Hot 10 Lite are definitely worth considering.\nThe smartphone world moves fast and competition is stiff. One way for the phone makers to stay relevant in the market is by releasing (top-quality) devices frequently.\nThis method, which seems to be the MO for a few Chinese brands in the market today, has proved rather effective. Less than 6 months since the launch of the Reno3, we’ve recently seen the Reno4.\nInfinix Hot 10 Specs Also employing a similar strategy is the Transsion-owned Infinix brand. The device pictured above is the Infinix Hot 9. Launched in Kenya and Uganda back in March, the device stuck to its roots, delivering a decent smartphone experience at a very affordable price.\nWell, fast-forward 6 months and Infinix is already delivering its successor, the Infinix Hot 10 and Hot 10 Lite.\n6 months is not a long time to innovate and as such, the Hot 10 is not a drastic departure from the Hot 9 from the build to its internals.\nThe screen is increased in size to 6.78 inches, up from 6.6 inches with a rather similar 720 x 1640 resolution that yields a dpi of 264, almost similar to its predecessor’s 266.\nThe Infinix Hot 10 is powered by the Mediatek Helio G70 chip, paired with 3+32GB for the base model —although this can be spec’d up to 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. Keeping everything juiced up is a 5200mAh cell, up from its predecessor’s 5000mAh cell.\nLet’s talk about cameras for a moment. At the back, the Hot 9 sports a 16MP main camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. At the front, there’s a hole-punch in the display that houses an 8MP sensor.\nGood stuff here. We’ll reserve our opinion for when we get a review unit to put it through its paces.\nThe Infinix Hot 10 is available in a few color options including Obsidian Black, Ocean Wave, Amber Red, and Moonlight Jade.\nSo what if you’re in the market for something a little cheaper than the Hot 10? Well, Infinix has something else just for you — the Hot 10 Lite.\nInfinix Hot 10 Lite The Infinix Hot 10 Lite waters down the specs of the Hot 10 and offers a rather compelling value proposition while at it.\nIt gets rid of the G70 chip and instead, employs the Mediatek MT6762D Helio A25. It also skims a little on the RAM and storage, offering users a 2+32GB combo. For a 2020 smartphone, this might be a little cramped. For the basic and lightweight smartphone users, however, the storage configuration should suffice.\nThe Hot 10 Lite retains the triple camera setup of its beefier sibling but waters down the sensors to a 13MP + 0.3MP + 0.3 MP combo with the main, macro, and depth sensor respectively.\nParting Shot While launching a new device every other day might work in allowing the company to remain relevant, it does have its drawbacks. Transsion brands are already doing dismally when it comes to updates.\nReleasing even more devices does not help this situation as the pool of devices that need to get supported (updates) only continues to grow.\nAlso, these devices released in quick succession bear little to no difference with each other. You see how a user could easily get confused in such a situation?\nPrice and Availability That aside, the Hot 10 and Hot 10 Lite have been released officially into the Kenyan market and they should retail at Ksh 13,999 and Ksh 10,499 on Jumia Kenya for the Hot 10 and Hot 10 Lite respectively.\nRelated ","wordCount":"1081","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robert Rape"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-hot-10-hot-10-lite-here-s-everything-you-need-to-know1709167/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Steaming Hot!
