Ultrawide monitors and particularly curved monitors are increasingly popular due to the immersive experience they provide. A lot of people used to think the curved panel was just a marketing gimmick, but it actually makes a huge difference and provides a pleasant experience.
 
In this article, we’re going to explore the best ultrawide monitors based on their size, panel type, refresh rate, and other variables. Continue reading and you’ll find something that fits your price range
 
## 1. LG 34WN750-B
 
Price range: $450-550.
 

 
The LG 34WN750-B offers the best value on the market. This 34-inch ultrawide monitor will give you the best price-performance ratio with its IPS panel, 1440p resolution, and HDR support.
 
Despite being fairly budget-friendly for an ultrawide monitor, this LG has borderless bezels so you can enjoy a maximum viewing area. On the back panel, you’ll find a series of useful connectors, including 2x HDMI, a Display port, a Headphone jack, 2x downstream USB ports, and a single upstream USB port. Too bad it doesn’t come with a USB-C connector as well.
 
The LG’s IPS panel displays vivid colors and a brightness level of 300 nits. The addition of HDR 10 enhances those colors further and delivers nice, deep darks. Overall, the monitor behaves well under normal conditions, but if the sun hits the screen, 300 nits isn’t ideal.  
 
#### Features
 
- IPS panel with 1440p resolution.HDR 10 and 99% sRGB color gamut.Adjustable stand and VESA support.AMD FreeSync.

 
## 2. Samsung Odyssey G9
 
Price range: $1,250-1,400.
 
The Samsung Odyssey G9 is one of the best options for gamers and fans of flight/racing sims in particular. As long as you have a high-end GPU, enough room on your desk, and money in your wallet, you should add this curved ultrawide monitor to your shopping list.
 
The 49-inch curved QLED panel gives you as much screen space as two 27-inch monitors without any loss of quality. But it’s not the size that gives you an immersive gaming experience. With a whopping 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and 400 nits worth of brightness (500+ nits in HDR), the quality of the image is stunning. The QLED tech also contributes to that by creating more color space than sRGB.
 
The Odyssey G9 is without a doubt an expensive luxury purchase and it requires a beefy graphics card.
 
- 49” curved QLED panel with a 1000R curve.HDR 1000 for vivid colors and depth.240Hz Refresh rate1ms response times.Supports VESA mounts.

 
## 3. BenQ EX3501R
 
Price range: $600-900.
 
The BenQ EX3501R has been showing up on “best ultrawide monitors” every year for some time now. There’s a reason for that – a great price to performance and features ratio.
 
The EX3501R is a 1440p resolution monitor with 1800R curvature. It gives you a wide viewing angle and helps you immerse yourself in the content you enjoy. Whether you’re playing a game or watching your favorite movies on Netflix, the EX3501R is a great multimedia display. The only thing that could be improved is the luminance because it’s limited to around 300 nits.
 
This BenQ monitor offers all the modern connectivity options you need, including HDMI 2.0, Display Port, and USB-C, and it also comes with some decent speakers. That said, it’s the out-of-the-box color accuracy that makes this ultrawide monitor a good choice. You don’t have to fidget with the controls or use a professional calibrator to get accurate colors, deep darks, and a great HDR experience.
 
- 35-inch VA panel with 1800R curvature.100Hz refresh rate.4ms response times.Supports HDR.Includes a USB Type-C connector.

 
## 4. AOC CU34G2X
 
Price range: $450-600
 
AOC is well-known for great gaming monitors at affordable rates. The CU34G2X model is a 1440p curved VA panel with a 144Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and great contrast. In this price range, it’s hard to beat, especially because it’s also fairly color-accurate right outside the box.
 
The AOC CU34G2X is a solid choice for gamers because of the 1ms response times. That said, you’ll also get great colors and detailed shadows when you switch to HDR. The only downside here is the brightness. This ultrawide monitor reaches around 300 units of luminance, which is on the darker side compared to the more expensive options on this list.
 
When it comes to connectivity, the CU34G2X doesn’t disappoint. It comes with 2X HDMI and 2X DisplayPort connectors, as well as 4x USB 3.2 ports. The only thing that’s missing here is a USB Type-C connector.
 
- 34-inch VA panel with 1500R curvature.144Hz refresh rate.1ms response times.Supports HDR.Plenty of connectivity options with 4x USB 3.2 ports.

 
## 5. Alienware AW3420DW
 
Price range: $650-850.
 
If you love plenty of curvature to cover your field of view and provide an immersive experience, the AlienWare AW3420DW might be just right for you.
 
This Alienware ultrawide monitor has an IPS panel with an impressive 1900R curvature for a top notch gaming experience. With a 120Hz refresh rate and fast 2ms response times you won’t be disappointed. That said, the most impressive feature is the color.
 
The AW3420DW produces incredible colors out of the box. It covers the sRGB gamut 100%, but it also boasts 98% DCI-P3 coverage. That’s impressive considering this isn’t a professional monitor for designers and content creators. This ultrawide monitor is worth getting in 2022 for the rich colors and curvature alone. 
 
The only major downside on this Alienware model is that it doesn’t support HDR. However, the realistic colors, fast response times, and overall great design compensate for that loss.
 
- 34-inch IPS panel with 1900R curvature.120Hz refresh rate.2ms response times.Covers 98% DCI-P3 color spectrum.Native Nvidia G-SYNC support.

 
## 6. ASUS ROG Swift PG35VQ
 
Price range: $1,500-1,900.
 
If money is no object and you simply want the best possible gaming experience, the ASUS ROG Swift PG35VQ should probably be your first choice. When the PG35VQ came out in 2019, it was THE flagship ultrawide monitor with the best features and it used to cost $2,499. Nowadays, you get that same level of performance that competes with all the newer models, for a significant discount (although still expensive).
 
The expensive ASUS ROG ultrawide monitor deserves a spot on this list thanks to its impressive color accuracy, gorgeous HDR, 2ms response times, and 200Hz refresh rate. The realistic colors and fast performance makes it a great choice for content creators as well as gamers and 2022 might be the best year to grab this monitor. In addition, it also comes with an integrated digital-to-analog converter that will give you a crystal-clear audio experience.
 
Overall, this ASUS ROG Swift panel comes with all the features you’d expect from a premium ultrawide model, including an ergonomic design and smart fan control. With a 90% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage, peak brightness of 1000 nits, and high-performance specs, it’s hard to go wrong.

## 7. Acer Predator Gaming X34
 
Price range: $900-1,000.
 
The Acer Predator Gaming X34 is a premium ultrawide monitor that was among the first ones that supported Nvidia G-Sync for top performance. If you’re looking for an immersive gaming experience under $1,000, this is one of the best picks.
 
The Predator is a 1440p IPS panel that can reach a 120Hz refresh rate when overclocked through the DisplayPort. The 4ms response time isn’t bad either unless you’re a competitive gamer who needs every advantage available. That said, the 21:9 aspect ratio and 100% sRGB color gamut give you an epic visual experience that almost justifies the price tag.
 
Overall, the Acer Predator is a gorgeous display but it does have some minor limitations worth mentioning. The main issue is a lack of ports. You get an HDMI and a DisplayPort along with 4 USB 3.0 connectors. Having more video connectors at this price would’ve been preferable. Finally, you should also consider your desk area because the V-shape stand requires a lot of space.
 
- 34-inch IPS panel with 1900R curvature.120Hz refresh rate and 4ms response times.Nvidia G-Sync support.Decent integrated speakers.

 
## 8. MSI Optix MPG341CQR
 
The MSI Optix is a premium 1440p ultrawide monitor in the under-$1,000 category. The price might still feel somewhat steep, but this gaming monitor competes with pricier ones like the Acer Predator.
 
The MSI MPG341CQR offers 105% sRGB color gamut coverage, 144Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time, making it a top of the line gaming monitor. It’s also fairly bright, reaching 400 nits luminance, and it supports HDR. The colors are vibrant and the blacks are deep enough to create detailed shadows and an immersive experience.
 
This MSI monitor is also a winner when it comes to connectivity. It comes with 2x HDMI ports and 2x DisplayPort connectors, as well as a USB Type-C port. Connect your gaming laptop and other devices to get the most out of this ultrawide monitor. As an added bonus, the MSI Optix comes with a camera cradle to help you stream more easily.

Price range: $1,250-1,700.
 
If size is all that really matters, you can go all in with the 49-inch Dell UltraSharp U4919DW. You might need a new computer desk for this behemoth.
 
Unlike the Samsung Odyssey G9, another 49-inch monster, the Dell UltraSharp boasts a 3800R curvature. This makes it extremely easy on the eyes and pleasant to work with for hours. That said, this ultrawide monitor is ideal for business and multitasking, not gaming.
 
The Dell UltraSharp U4919DW has a normal response time of 8ms and a 60Hz refresh rate, which isn’t usually desirable when playing games. It also doesn’t support HDR. However, the fact that you get a massive IPS panel with great contrast ratio and color accuracy makes it a good choice for almost everything else. Additionally, it comes with 2x HDMI 2.0 connectors, 1x DisplayPort, an impressive 5x USB 3.0 ports (down), and even a USB Type-C connector.
