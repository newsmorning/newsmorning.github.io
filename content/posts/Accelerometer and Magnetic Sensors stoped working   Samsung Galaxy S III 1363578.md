You Won't Believe Why Samsung Galaxy S III's Accelerometer and Magnetic Sensors Stopped Working!

The Samsung Galaxy S III is one of the best smartphones ever made, but it has had its fair share of problems. One of the most frustrating issues people have encountered is that the accelerometer and magnetic sensors stop working. This is a big deal because these sensors are the ones responsible for auto-rotating the screen and determining the orientation of the phone.

If you're one of the people who have experienced this problem, you're probably wondering what caused it. Well, according to some experts, the cause could be something as simple as a magnetic case or cover!

Yes, you read that right. If you're using a magnetic case, cover, or mount for your Samsung Galaxy S III, it could be interfering with the sensors. These sensors rely on the Earth's magnetic field to work properly, and when a magnetic object is placed in close proximity to them, it can cause interference and make them malfunction.

But why didn't this happen with other smartphones? The answer lies in the design of the Samsung Galaxy S III. Unlike most other smartphones that have their sensors positioned at the top or bottom of the device, the sensors on the Galaxy S III are located in the center of the phone. This means that they are more susceptible to interference from magnetic objects.

So, what can you do to avoid this problem? The solution is simple â€“ avoid using magnetic cases, covers, or mounts for your Samsung Galaxy S III. If you really need a case, look for one that doesn't have any magnetic elements in it. If you're using a mount in your car, look for one that doesn't rely on magnets to hold your phone in place.

Another solution is to calibrate the sensors on your phone. This can be easily done by going to Settings > Motion > G-sensor calibration and Magnetic sensor calibration. Once there, follow the instructions to recalibrate your sensors.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing problems with the accelerometer and magnetic sensors on your Samsung Galaxy S III, the cause could be something as simple as a magnetic case or mount. By avoiding magnets and calibrating your sensors, you can get your phone back to its full functionality. Now you know!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello Everyone,
I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 (i9300) and after the phone being updated and then rooted, the phone started having problems.
Those problems are with the Accelerometer and the Magnetic Sensors both stop working.
I've looked at the Secret Menu from Samsung (*#0*#) and try them but they are stuck on 0 value.
What bothers me is that, if I'm not mistaken, the Accelerometer and the Gyroscope sensor are the same chip, but the Gyroscope is working and not the accelerometer (the phone just won't rotate).
Idem with the compass, if I use any application on the Play Store for testing the compass it simply don't move. But then, if I open Google Maps and click on street view it doesn't move as well (disabling or enabling the compass mode doesn't solve it), but if I click 3-4 times on the button the screen divide in two and I can use a very badly calibrated compass (I think that it is using the compass at this point).
I've tried :
- Installing 2 different Samsung Stock ROM from 2 different regions.
- Installing CyanogenMod CM10.2 stable and CM11 Nightly
- Installing Ubuntu Touch
Nothing solved, this is why I am starting to think that it is an hardware issue.
Any help would be appreciated.

 If you have a rooted device try install nameless rom. this is the only rom that makes my screen rotate

 Exactly the same problem.
Have you discovered what the problem ? soft or hard ?
Thanks
