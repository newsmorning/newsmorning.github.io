# Why Your Life Will Be Forever Changed With A Smartphone Equipped With In-Display Fingerprint Sensor - Discover The 5 Benefits Now!

The smartphone, having become a quintessential part of our lives, has evolved significantly with various new features and technologies. The latest technology to feature in smartphones would be the In-Display Fingerprint Sensor, or commonly known as the under-display fingerprint reader. This new approach to biometric authentication technology might seem like just a small upgrade, but it holds huge value for users. In this article, we'll explore five benefits of having this technology in your smartphone.

## 1. Enhanced Security

The immediate benefit of using a smartphone equipped with an In-Display Fingerprint Sensor is enhanced security. This technology requires your unique fingerprint signature to unlock your phone. Unlike traditional biometric technology which requires you to place your thumb or finger on a specific spot, this technology is more convenient and enables you to access your phone's content quickly while keeping you secure from unauthorized access.

## 2. Time-Saving

With In-Display Fingerprint Sensor, users no longer have to type in lengthy passwords to unlock their phones. This technology scans your fingerprints and unlocks your phone instantly. Quick access to your phone will save you a lot of time, especially in situations where you need to access it urgently.

## 3. Smoother User Experience

In-Display Fingerprint Sensor technology provides a smoother user experience. The technology allows users to unlock their smartphones using either hand, making it easier to access their phone without having to adjust their grip to reach the reader's traditional placements. It is also a lot more accurate and faster as compared to the traditional fingerprint scanners.

## 4. More Space for Display

The traditional fingerprint scanner takes up a significant portion of the smartphone's screen real estate. It means that there's less space for the display window. In-Display Fingerprint Sensor technology eliminates the need for a physical scanner, resulting in a larger and more impressive display on your smartphone.

## 5. Aesthetically Pleasing

One of the characteristics of In-Display Fingerprint Sensor technology is that it has a sleek appearance. There are no ridges or bumps in the design, making the smartphone look elegant and more expensive. With this technology, manufacturers can reduce the size of the phone while keeping the screen large, resulting in a sleek and modern look.

In conclusion, the In-Display Fingerprint Sensor technology is changing the way we use our smartphones. The technology is improving security and providing a more convenient user experience. It is also more aesthetically pleasing, and the technology is expected to be more prevalent in future smartphone models. If you're in the market for a new smartphone, consider investing in one that comes equipped with In-Display Fingerprint Sensor technology. It will change your life for the better, and you'll never go back to the traditional fingerprint scanner again!

The evolution of smartphones has brought a lot with it. From the race to the slimmest phone on market, to the device with the least bezels; from the make with the sharpest camera, to the security trends in the fingerprint scanners and Face ID; name it all.  With such trends coming in over time, different issues arise that cause a need for yet another milestone.
 
For instance, a number of users find it complex when looking for the fingerprint sensor at the back. This is due to lack of its direct visibility on large screen devices, and a number of manufacturers have adopted suiting the sensor into the home screen. But larger screens also demand that the home screen should disappear, the in-display fingerprint sensor comes in sight.
 
At the Consumers Electronics Show (CES) 2018 in Las Vegas, the Vivo smartphone brand introduces an under-display fingerprint sensor feature on its latest smartphone, the Vivo X21. With other OEMs adopting the feature, this could be the next ultimate big thing.
 
## How Does the in-display Fingerprint Reader Work?
 
When a user’s finger touches the screen of the phone, the display emits light to illuminate the finger. The optical fingerprint sensor below the display captures the light reflected by the fingerprint, and the sensor processes the optical signals to deliver crisp and sharp fingerprint images for matching, based on the reflected light from the unique ridges on the fingerprint,
 
When fingerprint recognition is needed, such as when the screen is off and for unlocking apps or when you hold up the phone, the fingerprint sensor indicator will light up and icon will appear on the screen for users to press for immediate authentication.  It is otherwise invisible to ensure a seamless mobile experience.
 
## Reasons you may want it
 
Nature: Those that have held smartphones from their inception will tell you that the very first fingerprint sensors were at the front. Samsung, OnePlus, and Apple had this in mind before the fight for the larger screens pushed them to shift the sensors to the back. So, it would be very natural to have that sensor in the display.
 
Convenience: A front-mounted sensor is also more convenient to use when your phone is resting on your table. No need to raise it up, the way you would do for one at the back. You can also relate to a situation when you are holding stuff in your hands, and only a single finger is free. Even in a car, you can easily unlock the phone when its in its holder.
 
Broader Scanner: You don’t have to squeeze a large thumb into a small scanner area. The in-display fingerprint scanner will make it easier to place a finger anywhere on the screen to unlock it seamlessly.
 
No specific finger: When holding your phone with your left hand, it could be most sure that a left finger will do the unlock – say the scanner is at the back. With the in-screen fingerprint reader, you do not have to hustle on looking for the finger to use, whatever is available is what you use. No worries about being left or right handed.
 
Accuracy: Some rear scanners are really stubborn and require you to place the finger a certain way to work. This is primarily because you cant see where you are placing the finger, and can’t confirm that it is indeed the right position. With a front display scanner, why would you fail on accuracy when you can see where to place it?
 
## The Downside
 
Being optical-type sensors, they are slower than the capacitive ones that most people are used to by now. This is a reason for the delay in OEMs adopting them for smartphones.
