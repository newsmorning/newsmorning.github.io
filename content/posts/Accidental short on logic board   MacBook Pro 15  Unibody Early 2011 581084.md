Title: MacBook Pro Disaster: Logic Board Short Causes Chaos!

Introduction:

Apple's MacBook Pro has always been a glorified product for many, with its sleek design, impressive performance, and reliable software. However, of late, the Macbook Pro has suffered a massive setback due to a significant hardware issue - the Logic Board Short.

Body:

A logic board short in a MacBook Pro refers to the failure of the component responsible for processing and transmitting data instructions between devices. It is the central system board that connects to all internal and external computer devices and peripherals, and any malfunction or failure could cause significant disruption to the system's performance.

The logic board short is caused by various reasons, including power surges or fluctuations, manufacturing defects, and natural wear and tear. Once the short happens, the MacBook Pro computer is rendered almost unusable, leading to significant frustrations for its owners.

Many MacBook Pro users have reported experiencing the logic board short issue, with the majority of them being owners of the more recent MacBook Pro models. Such is its severity that Apple has issued a statement acknowledging the issue, saying that it affects a small number of customers who own the 13-inch MacBook Pro models manufactured between 2016 and 2017.

The chaos that the logic board short has caused is unimaginable, with many MacBook Pro users forced to spend exorbitant amounts of money to fix their devices. Some have had to trash their MacBook Pros altogether, leading to significant losses of valuable data and taking a considerable toll on their productivity, especially during these challenging times.

Conclusion:

The MacBook Pro disaster caused by the logic board short has been a significant wake-up call for Apple, especially since it has affected a significant number of MacBook Pro users. Although Apple has acknowledged the issue, the company's effort in rectifying the issue remains inadequate, leading to continued frustrations for users.

It is about time that Apple takes responsibility and finds a lasting solution to the logic board short issue affecting MacBook Pro. In the meantime, MacBook Pro users need to take extra precautions to protect their devices by seeking regular check-ups and backup their data regularly.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I wanted to flash DeMux on my machine to fix discrete GPU problems.
Unluckily I did not think (…) about disconnecting the battery cable before soldering the JTAG header on the board, and one of the wires did some short somewhere on the board (I heard the “zap”).
Now:
machine does not turn on
battery  button does nothing
Plugging magsafe only does a **very** dim green light.
Is there a walk-through guide on what to check in this case?

 That happened to me when I tried to do the RealMacMods method, I ended up selling it for parts/not working on ebay.
Now I can’t answer your question but I recently got another computer with the same problem and I can say that for future reference there is a great software solution here:

Better than Dosdude1s method in my opinion because brightness control still works.
