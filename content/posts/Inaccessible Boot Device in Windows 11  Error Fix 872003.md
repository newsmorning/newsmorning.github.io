## What is an inaccessible boot device in Windows 11?
 
In general, a boot device is any piece of hardware that holds or is capable of reading the files and drivers necessary for a computer launch. To start your computer, the operating system is usually loaded from the boot media, which can be a hard disk, a CD/DVD, or a USB drive.
 
In a nutshell, the inaccessible boot device error informs the PC that it has met a problem and must restart to address it. If you notice an Inaccessible Boot Device this implies that your computer is unable to read the Windows 11 partition on the hard drive from which it boots. 
 
This problem might lead to hard disk failure. It might also be a simple driver issue or a boot record failure.
 
When Windows boots up, it may fail to reach the memory partition containing the system files. This results in the Inaccessible_Boot_Device error message in Windows 11 and stops your PC from booting.
 
### What causes an inaccessible boot device?
 
Although many many reported seeing this error message as a consequence of a failed update, the boot device problem can be caused by a variety of factors, including BIOS upgrades and overclocked CPUs. In most cases, an inaccessible boot device Windows 11 error signifies more than just one reason.Â  
 
One of your SSDs is not showing, which might be unlikely but not impossible. You can always try plugging it into another computer to see if the SSDÂ appears. Another aspect to consider isÂ something in the BIOS has been modified, preventing the computer from accessing the SSD.Â 
 
The good news is that, due to its proximity to the Windows Update, this is easily fixable and will result in no data loss. Itâ€™s only that Windows canâ€™t locate the disk, but all of the data on the drive is still present and will remain. These are the most common scenarios in which you may encounter this error:
 
ðŸš©Inaccessible boot device Windows 11 after driver update failureðŸš©Inaccessible boot device Windows 11 after clone is madeðŸš©Inaccessible boot device after BIOS update not successfulðŸš©Inaccessible boot device Windows 11 SSD is missing
 
As stated by many users, Lenovo and Dell are the most afflicted PC manufacturers by the inaccessible boot device windows 11 error, but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s standard only on these PC brands.
 
The worst aspect about it all is that these are caused by necessary updates without notice. This is a complex fix, but it is achievable once you have access to the Advanced Boot settings and the command prompt.
 
The same Inaccessible_Boot_Device error appears on Windows 10 too. There are, however, a few ways you can feasibly fix it. To do so, youâ€™ll need to make the most of Windows 11â€™s built-in system tools, which often provide the best solutions for BSOD issues.
 
### Is this a blue, green, or black screen error?
 
In Windows 10, the Inaccessible_Boot_Device error is a Blue Screen of Death error. However, Microsoft has changed the background color of BSOD errors to black in Windows 11. Therefore, this issue is a Black Screen of Death one in the latest desktop platform, but itâ€™s still the same error.
 
To make things a bit more confusing, Windows 11 Insider Preview builds have Green Screens of Death errors instead of black ones. Theyâ€™re the same errors with a different background color. Thus, the Inaccessible_Boot_Device error screen can also have a green background for some users.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click hereÂ to download and start repairing.

### How can I enter Windows 11â€™s Advanced Recovery Options?
 
If you canâ€™t get into Windows 11 because of the Inaccessible_Boot_Device error, youâ€™ll need to enter Advanced Recovery Options during the system startup. Advanced Recovery Options is a centralized blue menu outside of Windows that includes numerous system tools and options.
 
Some users may be able to enter Advanced Recovery Options with the F11 keyboard key. Try pressing it shortly after turning on your PC. Then the blue Choose an option menu might open, but thatâ€™s not a universal method.
 
If that doesnâ€™t work, restart the computer by pressing and holding its Power button for about 5 to 10 seconds when you see the Windows logo during the startup. Force the shutdown in that way three times. After you restart your PC like that three times in a row, an Automatic Repair screen will appear.
 
This screen includes an Advanced options button. Click that button to enter the Advanced Recovery Options menu. From there, you can access system tools that can feasibly fix the Inaccessible_Boot_Device error or activate Safe Mode.
 
You can get back into Windows with the Safe Mode option. To do so, select Troubleshoot and Advanced options. From there, select Start-up Settings and Restart. When Windows restarts, press F4 (or F5) to choose Enable Safe Mode on the Start-up Settings menu.
 
Thereafter, you will be able to apply the potential fixes above as outlined in Safe Mode. That mode is a special diagnostic one for Windows 11, which loads with only minimal driver sets and services.
 
### Can I apply the potential fixes above without entering Safe Mode?
 
The Advanced options menu outside of Windows includes System Restore, Command Prompt, Startup Repair, and Uninstall Updates tools. So yes, you can apply most of the resolutions above by opening the required tools for them from there.

The Advanced options menu also includes a System Image Recovery utility. If your PC has a system image backup, that option could resolve the Inaccessible_Boot_Device error.
 
If those potential resolutions arenâ€™t enough to fix the Inaccessible Boot Device Windows 11 error on your computer, the issue might be due to faulty hardware. In which case, you might need to remove and replace faulty internal hardware modules to solve it.
 
Itâ€™s not recommended for home users to remove faulty internal components themselves. So, consider returning your PC to its manufacturer for repairs if the above resolutions donâ€™t resolve the error. If your computer is still within its warranty period, its manufacturer might fix the issue free of charge.
 
However, give the potential resolutions above a try first before turning to any IT support or repair services. Although theyâ€™re not entirely guaranteed fixes, thereâ€™s a good chance at least one of them will resolve the Inaccessible_Boot_Device error on your PC.
