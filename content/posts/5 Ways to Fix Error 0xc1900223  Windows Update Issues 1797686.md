Updating your Windows operating system is important to keep your computer running smoothly and protect it from security vulnerabilities. However, when you encounter an error during the update process, it can be frustrating and time-consuming to troubleshoot. One such error that many users have experienced is the Windows Update error 0Xc1900223. This error can occur when upgrading to a newer version of Windows, such as Windows 10. In this article, we will outline five easy fixes to help you overcome this stubborn error and successfully update your operating system.

## Method 1: Free Up Disk Space

One of the most common causes of the Windows Update error 0Xc1900223 is running out of disk space. Before attempting any other method of troubleshooting, it is important to check the available disk space on your computer. You can do this by going to "This PC" or "My Computer" and right-clicking on your main hard drive. Select "Properties" and check the available free space. If you have less than 20GB of free space, you should free up some space before attempting to update your operating system.

To free up disk space, you can uninstall unused programs, delete old files, and clear your internet and system cache. You can also use the built-in Disk Cleanup tool to automatically free up space.

## Method 2: Disable Third-Party Antivirus Software

Another common cause of the Windows Update error 0Xc1900223 is third-party antivirus software. Sometimes, antivirus software may interfere with the Windows update process, causing the error. If you have third-party antivirus software installed, try temporarily disabling it and then attempting the update again. To disable your antivirus software, right-click on its icon in the taskbar and select "Disable" or "Turn off." You can also access your antivirus settings and turn off real-time protection.

## Method 3: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

Windows operating system includes a built-in troubleshooter that can help diagnose and fix common issues related to Windows Update. To run the troubleshooter, go to "Settings," then "Update & Security," and click on "Troubleshoot." Select "Windows Update" and click on "Run the troubleshooter." Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process. Once the troubleshooter has finished, check if the error has been resolved and if you are able to install the latest updates.

## Method 4: Use the Media Creation Tool

If the above methods do not work, you can try using the Media Creation Tool to upgrade to the latest version of Windows. The Media Creation Tool allows you to create a bootable USB drive or DVD and then use it to upgrade your system. To use the Media Creation Tool, go to the official Microsoft website and download it. Once downloaded, run the tool and select "Upgrade this PC now" or "Create installation media for another PC." Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

## Method 5: Perform a Clean Install of Windows

If all else fails, you can perform a clean install of Windows. This method involves deleting everything on your hard drive and then installing a fresh copy of Windows. Before performing a clean install, be sure to backup all your important files and data to an external hard drive or cloud storage. You will also need to create a bootable USB drive or DVD for the Windows installation process. Once you have backed up your data and created a bootable drive, restart your computer and boot from the drive. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform a clean install of Windows.

In conclusion, the Windows Update error 0Xc1900223 can be a frustrating issue to deal with, but there are several methods for troubleshooting and resolving the error.
