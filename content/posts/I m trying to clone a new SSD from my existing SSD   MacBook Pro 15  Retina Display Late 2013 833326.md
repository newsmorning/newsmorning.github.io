## Chosen Solution
 I’m trying to clone a new SSD from my existing SSD and my Mac doesn’t recognize it. I have installed the new SSD into an mSATA enclosure and plugged it into the USB port on my laptop ,and when I open the Disk Utility it does not show up. Any suggestions?

 Lets use a better solution! Use Migration Assistant which is located in your Utilities folder. Cloning software is so passé! Apple has changed enough stuff that you can’t really use these tools any more effectively.
But before you even do that you likely have a OS and/or drive format issue. You see, Apple altered the low level formatting of your drive from HFS+ to APFS when you upgraded your system to High Sierra or Mojave.
You are likely are using a system which is still running Sierra or older to try to access your SSD which was running High Sierra or newer. So you’ll need to upgrade your systems OS before you can gain access to the SSD.

 What program did you use to clone the SSD?  I have had no issues using carbon copy cloner.
