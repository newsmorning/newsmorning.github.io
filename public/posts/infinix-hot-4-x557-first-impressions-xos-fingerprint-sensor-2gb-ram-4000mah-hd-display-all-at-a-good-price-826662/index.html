The launch saw two Infinix devices hit the Uganda market; Infinix Note 3 and the Hot 4. Infinix has been popular in Nigeria and Kenya as an online, high end smartphone brand that targets the middle class. As a result, the phones are sold mostly online and Infinix as a brand does not have entry level devices.\nWe had time to review the Note 3 giving you the specs and price, first impressions and a complete review. We now bring you our first impressions with the Infinix Hot 4.\nSummary The Infinix Hot 4, even though a budget device, shocks you with its quality and functionality. You instantly realise that for it’s price, it is a steal. It comes with 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM, an HD display, a 4000 mAh battery, a fingerprint scanner among others. So if you are looking for a budget phone that packs in some really good specs and performance, read on.\nUnboxing The Infinix Hot 4 comes neatly wrapped in a branded yellow long box with an image of the gold version of the Hot 4 printed on top. At the bottom of the box are the basic specifications and IMEI numbers. In the box is the Hot 4 with a white portable charger, USB cable, earphones and a manual.\nSpecifications Announced: 2016, August Available: 2016 October Model: X557 Hot 4 Colors: Scarlet Red/ Sandstone Black/ Turquoise Dream/ Luxurious Gold/ Sapphire Blue SIM: Dual SIM (Micro-SIM, dual standby) OS: XOS based on Android v6.0 Marshmallow Network: GSM, WCDMA,GPRS, EDGE, HSPA, Dimensions: 152.676.28.8mm Weight: 175g Display: 5.5″ FHD IPS Touchscreen CPU: Octa-core 1.3GHz, 64bit, ARM Mali-T720 Memory: 16GB ROM, 2GB RAM, microSD, up to 32 GB (dedicated slot) Camera: 8MP, autofocus, LED flash, 5MP front Camera with Flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, hotspot, Bluetooth v4.1, OTG, Quick Charge, GPS Sensors: Accelerometer, Light, Gyro, Proximity, Compass, Fingerprint Battery: Non -Removable Li-Ion 4000 mAh battery\nApps The Hot 4 comes with all the basic apps you need to get started. Unfortunately, most of them will be needing updates. Among the pre-installed apps are the usual Google suite, basic Android apps like calculator, clock, radio etc. then the Infinix family of apps.\nInfinix has built custom apps for their devices which include, Xcloud for cloud storage of your files (we aren’t sure how much space is given), Xmanager and Xpower are inbuilt phone optimisers that help you clean up and optimise your smartphones performance. Xshare is an equivalent of Xender or Flash share that allows 2 devices share files over WiFi. Xthemes helps you customise your device while Xweather provides localised weather forecasts, Xhide helps keep your device private, Xaccount and Xclub help you access a community of Infinix users who offer lots of useful information.\nOther apps include an inbuilt manual, the Carlcare app to help you locate places you can get your device fixed or user guide and a compass.\nXOS XOS is Infinix’s custom skin or call it operating system based on Android. XOS offers an easy to use interface with a host of relevant apps to make your experience satisfactory.\nThe device is highly customisable to suit the different needs of users. Most importantly there seems to be more regular OS updates to Infinix devices.\nDesign The Hot 4 comes in a basic but user friendly design. The design features a textured back for better grip, 5.5 display that’s not too big or too small – just enough. Both the power button and volume rockers were placed to the right while the charging port is at the bottom left. The earphone jack is at the top left and the speaker is at the back – bottom centre..\nCamera The Hot 4 sports an 8MP rear shooter and a 5MP selfie camera. Even though basic, it met the bare minimums for a good enough camera performing better in full light than low light.\nThe Hot 4 camera had some interesting features though. For instance, the rear camera had a pro mode that allows you have more creative control over the settings. Also, the selfie camera has a flash and a wide angle mode for better selfies.\nBattery The Hot 4 comes with a 4000 mAh battery which is amazing for a device of it’s size and budget.\nHowever, we didn’t stay with the Hot 4 long enough to rate the battery but for the few days we had it, it performed well. Charging for between 60-90 minutes and lasting us about a day with moderate usage.\nThere are many inbuilt apps to help you make the best of your battery including the ultra power mode that could give you about 20minutes on 2% battery.\nWhat we liked 2GB RAM Fingerprint scanner XOS Price OTA updates overall experience What we didn’t like Non removable battery No screen protector No accessories on the market yet Price and Where to buy The Infinix Hot 4 is exclusively sold on online on Kilimall in Uganda and will not be in shops and physical stores anytime soon. We wrote about how to order for the device just in case it’s challenging for you.\nThe Infinix Hot 4 is going for the price of Ugx 360,000\nThe last word The Infinix Hot 4 is the perfect first smartphone giving you a peak into premium features on a budget. For it’s price and what it can do, it’s a steal.\nIt would also be a perfect replacement device when say you’ve lost your phone or if it’s gone on a break.\nRelated ","wordCount":"1343","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Raul Cranmer"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-hot-4-x557-first-impressions-xos-fingerprint-sensor-2gb-ram-4000mah-hd-display-all-at-a-good-price-826662/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe the Incredible Features Infinix Hot 4 X557 Packs in - Fingerprint Sensor, 2GB Ram, 4000mAh Battery & More - All at an Unbeatable Price!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 3, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1343 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Raul Cranmer</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#fingerprint-sensor>Fingerprint Sensor</a></li><li><a href=#2gb-ram>2GB RAM</a></li><li><a href=#4000mah-battery>4000mAh Battery</a></li><li><a href=#expandable-storage--dual-sim>Expandable Storage & Dual SIM</a></li><li><a href=#amazing-camera>Amazing Camera</a></li><li><a href=#beautiful-display>Beautiful Display</a></li><li><a href=#unbeatable-price>Unbeatable Price</a></li><li><a href=#summary>Summary</a></li><li><a href=#unboxing>Unboxing</a></li><li><a href=#specifications>Specifications</a></li><li><a href=#apps>Apps</a></li><li><a href=#xos>XOS</a></li><li><a href=#design>Design</a></li><li><a href=#camera>Camera</a></li><li><a href=#battery>Battery</a></li><li><a href=#what-we-liked>What we liked</a></li><li><a href=#what-we-didnt-like>What we didn’t like</a></li><li><a href=#price-and-where-to-buy>Price and Where to buy</a></li><li><a href=#the-last-word>The last word</a><ul><li><a href=#related>Related</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=you-wont-believe-the-incredible-features-infinix-hot-4-x557-packs-in---fingerprint-sensor-2gb-ram-4000mah-battery--more---all-at-an-unbeatable-price>You Won&rsquo;t Believe the Incredible Features Infinix Hot 4 X557 Packs in - Fingerprint Sensor, 2GB Ram, 4000mAh Battery & More - All at an Unbeatable Price!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-wont-believe-the-incredible-features-infinix-hot-4-x557-packs-in---fingerprint-sensor-2gb-ram-4000mah-battery--more---all-at-an-unbeatable-price>#</a></h1><p>Are you looking for a smartphone that has excellent features but won&rsquo;t burn a hole in your pocket?
