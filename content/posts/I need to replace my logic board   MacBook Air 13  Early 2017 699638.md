# Macbook Air Owners Beware: Logic Board Failure on the Rise! Why You Need to Replace Yours ASAP!

If you're an owner of a Macbook Air, then you've probably grown to love the reliability and sleekness of your machine. However, recent data suggests that Macbook Air owners should be aware of a rising issue: logic board failure. In this article, we'll discuss what logic board failure is, how to tell if your Macbook Air might be vulnerable to it, and why it's essential to replace your logic board as soon as possible.

## What is Logic Board Failure?

The logic board, also known as the motherboard, is the central control system of your Macbook Air. It houses the processor, graphics card, memory, storage, and many other components necessary for your computer to function correctly. If the logic board fails, your Macbook Air will likely become inoperable or suffer significant performance issues.

There are a few reasons why your logic board may fail, including:

- Liquid damage from a spill or environmental exposure
- Overheating due to poor ventilation or high performance demands
- Manufacturing defects, such as faulty components

While logic board failure can happen to any computer, it's become an increasingly common problem for Macbook Air users.

## How to Tell if Your Macbook Air is Vulnerable

One way to tell if your Macbook Air is vulnerable to logic board failure is by looking at its age. Generally, Macbook Airs manufactured between 2012 and 2015 have a higher risk of failure due to their design and hardware components. However, any machine, regardless of age, can suffer from manufacturing defects or environmental damage.

Another way to tell if your Macbook Air is at risk is by paying attention to its performance. If your computer is experiencing unexpected shutdowns, slow performance, or unresponsive systems, it's worth investigating the issue further.

## Why You Need to Replace Your Logic Board ASAP

If you suspect that your Macbook Air might be vulnerable to logic board failure, it's essential to replace it as soon as possible. Here are a few reasons why:

- Prevent data loss: If your machine becomes inoperable due to a logic board failure, you may lose important files and data that you can't recover.
- Avoid costly repairs: Replacing your logic board is generally a more affordable option than repairing other aspects of your machine, such as the screen or keyboard.
- Maintain performance: A functioning logic board is essential to maintaining the performance of your Macbook Air. If it fails, your computer may become unusable or suffer from significant performance issues.

## Conclusion

While logic board failure is a rising issue for Macbook Air owners, there are steps you can take to prevent it. If you suspect that your machine is vulnerable to failure, the best course of action is to have it inspected and, if necessary, replace the logic board. By taking these steps, you'll ensure that your Macbook Air continues to function correctly and avoid costly repairs or data loss.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I have damage on my Logic board and am looking to replace it. I was wondering if and what logic board i could replace it with that might be from an older Macbook air rather than the 2017 logic board. Speed and performance isn't an issue I just need to get it back up and running again.

 The 2017 model is a very minor update as Intel stopped production of the older CPU’s the MacBook Air used. Because of this minor alteration of the CPU the rest of the logic board is exactly the same as the 2015. Here’s the IFIXIT guide you’ll need to follow: MacBook Air 13" Early 2015 Logic Board Replacement and here’s the possible boards:
MacBook Air 13" (Early 2015) 1.6 GHz Logic BoardMacBook Air 13" (Early 2015) 2.2 GHz Logic Board
You’ll have two choices a 4 or 8 GB board under each.
But are you really sure this is your best option? Have you had anyone look at it and/or try to clean and repair your logic board?
