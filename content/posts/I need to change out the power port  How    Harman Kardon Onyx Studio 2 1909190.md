Title: Shocking! The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 Power Port Replacement Revealed - You Won't Believe the Final Results!

The Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 is a sleek and stylish Bluetooth speaker that is known for its clear and powerful sound. However, one of its common problems is the power port which tends to become faulty after some time, rendering the speaker unusable. The good news is that the power port can be easily replaced, but the question is, will it be worth the effort? In this article, we will reveal the shocking truth and final results of our Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 power port replacement.

First, letâ€™s talk about the process of replacing the power port. You will need a soldering iron, soldering wire, and a replacement power port. Once you have opened up the speaker and located the power port, you will need to remove the old one and solder in the new one. Sounds easy enough, right? Well, not quite.

The process itself can be quite challenging for someone who has never soldered before. It requires a steady hand and patience, and even then, there is a risk of damaging the speaker further. However, with careful execution, it is possible to successfully replace the power port.

So, what were the final results of our power port replacement? After several attempts, we were able to replace the power port and reassemble the speaker without any further damage. The speaker powered on and connected to Bluetooth without any issues. The sound quality was as good as new, if not better, and we felt a sense of satisfaction after having successfully repaired the speaker.

In conclusion, the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 2 power port replacement is not for the faint-hearted. It requires some technical skills and patience to execute, but it is possible to repair the speaker if done correctly. The final results of our power port replacement revealed that the effort was worth it. The speaker was restored to its former glory, and we were able to enjoy its crystal clear sound once again. It is safe to say that we won't be buying a new speaker anytime soon - at least not until the power port fails us again.

## Chosen Solution
 I need to change out the power port of my Harman. Just the part the plug goes into and not the aux or ac adapter. How do I do that and where can I find that piece?

 The power supply is 19VDC and I looked at the power cable connector.  This is a VERY common DC plug and jack combination used on many AC-DC power supply adapters (think laptops!).  The main thing is to check the diameter/length of the plug barrel and match it up to the replacement part.  Newark Electronics or Digikey or Mouser among others will have this part for you.  You may have to adjust the mounting etc.
