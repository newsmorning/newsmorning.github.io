Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Replaced My iPhone 6 Screen - The Home Button Became Totally Useless!

Introduction:
Smartphones have become an irreplaceable part of our daily lives. Many people rely on their iPhones for various purposes, ranging from communication to entertainment, and even conducting business. However, accidents happen, and your iPhone screen can get damaged, causing significant inconvenience. Replacing the screen can be a costly affair, but a necessary one. Unfortunately, replacing your iPhone 6 screen comes with its own set of challenges that you might not be aware of. In this article, I'll share my experience with the iPhone 6 screen replacement and the unanticipated issue that emerged with the home button.

Body:
Recently, my iPhone 6 screen got shattered, and I had to replace it. I went to a third-party phone repair service because Apple's screen replacement service is expensive. After replacing the screen, I thought everything was fine until I realized that the home button had become completely useless. Every time I pressed the button, nothing happened. I tried closing and reopening the apps, but the button still didn't work. I was irritated and confused, and so I went back to the repair shop to understand what had happened.

The technician who worked on my phone explained that the home button on the iPhone 6 is connected to the screen, and replacing it can damage the button's functionality. However, the technician assured me that there was a software fix available, and that it was easy to implement. The technician explained that the fix involved navigating to settings and accessing the "assistive touch mode" function. This function offers an on-screen version of the home button that you can use instead of the physical button. The technician demonstrated how to enable the feature, and my home button was back to working again without any issues.

While this workaround resolved the issue, the experience highlights the potential risks associated with replacing your iPhone screen. The repair may seem like a quick solution, but if not handled by a competent technician, it can lead to similar issues as mine, resulting in more headaches and additional expenses. It's also worth noting that while the assistive touch feature can be helpful, it may not be as functional as a physical button. Therefore, itâ€™s always advisable to take your iPhone to an authorized Apple service provider to avoid potential complications.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, replacing an iPhone 6 screen can be a daunting experience that can lead to unforeseen complications such as the home button becoming faulty. While there's a software fix available, it's always best to seek assistance from a reputable phone repair service provider, especially those authorized by Apple. As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure, and thus, it's essential to handle your iPhone with more care to avoid damaging the screen in the first place. Ultimately, my experience serves as a reminder that we always need to be aware of the potential risks and repercussions associated with iPhone screen replacements.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello all. Forgive me if this has been answered before, but I couldn't find the exact scenario when searching your forum. I replaced my iPhone 6 screen (just the LCD/glass/digitizer and transferred everything else). The screen worked great, but I found my home button wasn't working. I then switched the button out with the button from another iPhone 6 I also need to fix (different issue). That button didn't work either
I thought I had narrowed it down to the new screen being the issue once I swapped buttons. I then put the original screen and button back on the phone just so I wouldn't lose the parts while I ordered another replacement screen. I was expecting the home button to work with the old screen now in place, but it still doesn't work.
I now need help figuring out where the issue is. I've only replaced a screen a couple times, so I'm no expert, but I'm thinking there's something wrong with the back plate that I had transferred to the new screen. Maybe one of the cables is busted?
I guess my big question is, if I buy a replacement back plate, which I saw isn't very expensive...will Touch ID work with that aftermarket back plate? If not, I'd like to then continue troubleshooting with the original back plate and figure out if I can fix the problem?
Suggestions? Answers?   Thanks in advance!

 Did you cut/tear the home button  cable when you replaced the screen? Also check to make sure the home button is seated properly in the frame.
If that doesn't work go in settings and see if you have the on screen home button turned on, If so turn it off.
