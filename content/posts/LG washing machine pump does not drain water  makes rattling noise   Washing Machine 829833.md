Is Your LG Washing Machine Trying to Tell You Something? Find Out Why Its Pump Isn't Draining Water and Making a Strange Rattling Noise!

Your LG washing machine is like any other household appliance; it can make strange noises or stop functioning altogether. One of the most frustrating issues is when the pump stops draining water from the machine's drum. In this article, we'll explore why your LG washing machine's pump is struggling and making a strange rattling sound.

Step 1: Check for Clogs

The pump located in the bottom of your washing machine is responsible for draining the water out of the drum. If your machine isn't draining, it's possible that the pump is clogged. Locate the filter at the bottom of the machine, remove and clean it out. Inspect the drain hose, and clear any obstructions if there are any.

Step 2: Check the Impeller

The pump's impeller is responsible for driving water out of the machine. If the impeller gets damaged or gets jammed, it can make the pump struggle to drain the water out of the machine, resulting in a strange rattling noise. To test if the impeller is damaged, try manually turning it with a screwdriver. You shouldn't feel any resistance, and it should spin smoothly. If there's resistance or an irregular sound, you may need to replace the impeller.

Step 3: Check the Pump Motor

If the pump's impeller looks fine, and you've eliminated clogs as a possible cause, the issue could be with the pump's motor. The motor's purpose is to drive the impeller, and if it's faulty or burned out, the pump won't function correctly, resulting in a rattling noise. Check the wiring connections between the pump motor and the control board. If there are any loose or disconnected wires, reconnect them firmly. If the connections are fine, and the motor is still faulty, it's time to replace it.

Step 4: Call a Professional

If none of these steps have helped, the issue may be too complicated for you to tackle on your own. In this case, it's best to contact a professional. A qualified engineer will have the tools and knowledge to find the root of the problem and carry out any necessary repairs.

Conclusion

In conclusion, it's essential to understand the warning signs your LG washing machine is giving you when it's not functioning correctly. If the pump isn't draining water and making a strange rattling noise, it's time to investigate. Checking for clogs, impeller, and motor are easy solutions to try before calling a professional. Proper maintenance and care will keep your machine operating smoothly and keep the headaches away.

## Chosen Solution
 LG F8065Q / WD-M1070TD washing machine, PUMP LG BPX2-8
I have replaced pump with new one. Same issue (unless both are defective). It sometimes gets out water with force but most of the time it trickles it out or cannot even get it out (making a clicking/rattling noise). So it seems like it is just weak.
Tested voltage to the pump and it is correct so the control board seems fine too.
I made a video of how it's not pumping water out. It makes rattling/clicking noise. When I drain the water out manually it stops rattling and then just  a humming sound. When I also remove the pump from the housing it shows spinning normally with torque. So I am stumped what to do here.

 martin, check the drain hoses for any obstruction. Check the drain pump filter etc. to make sure it is not obstructed. Let us know if you think that the noise originate at the pump or between the tub and pump. This really does not appear to be a pump issue.
