# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed the Display on My iPhone 6! The Blinking Just Won't Stop - Learn How to Fix It Now!

Have you ever experienced a situation when you replaced your iPhone 6 display, and suddenly a blinking display appears with no apparent fix in sight? Well, it happened to me, and it was a frustrating experience. However, I learned some valuable lessons that I would love to share with you.

Firstly, let's try to understand why this blinking display happens after replacing the display on an iPhone 6. Most of the time, the cause of the problem is the incompatibility of the replacement display module with the phone's firmware. Technically, Apple wants to ensure that you replace your iPhone's display with an authorized one or at least a certified alternative. If you use an unauthorized replacement display, it could cause technical issues like blinking, color distortion, or even a black screen.

Now, the question is - how can you fix this problem and prevent it from occurring in the first place? Firstly, make sure to replace your iPhone 6 display with a certified alternative or authorized service provider. If you still face the blinking issue, the following steps will help fix the problem:

Step #1: Force Restart Your iPhone 6

If you experience a blinking display on your iPhone 6, the first troubleshooting tip is to force restart your phone. To force restart, press and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button simultaneously. Hold the buttons until the Apple logo appears, and your phone restarts.

Step #2: Reset All Settings on Your iPhone 6

If force restarting the device did not resolve the blinking issue, the next option is to reset all settings on your iPhone 6.

Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. This process will reset all your iPhone settings to default, but it won't erase any data or media from your phone.

Step #3: Restore Your iPhone 6 with iTunes

If none of the first two solutions worked, you need to restore your iPhone 6 with iTunes. To do this, connect your iPhone 6 to your computer, open iTunes and click "Restore" on the Summary tab of your device.

iTunes will download the latest firmware and restore your iPhone to its original state. Note that this process will delete all data, media, and settings from your iPhone 6, so backup your phone before starting.

In conclusion, the blinking display issue on an iPhone 6 after replacing a display can be a frustrating experience. However, following these tips to fix the issue will help restore your phone back to normal. Remember, it is essential to use authorized or certified display alternatives when replacing your iPhone display to prevent technical issues like this from occurring.

## Chosen Solution
 I dropped my iphone in water for not even 3 seconds. The diagnosis was that the battery was not keeping charge and the display had broken due to contact with water.
I bought an extra battery and extra display from iFixit, replaced these parts and it is now working. The battery is working just fine but the display keeps on blinking.
Any thoughts on how to fix it?
Tks in advance.

 Hi Pedro, I would say you did everything correctly however you may need to clean all the copper contacts with 91% isopropyl alcohol or higher to get any residue left from the water damage off the board. I hope this helps and don't be worried the alcohol is completely safe. Use a soft bristle toothbrush to clean it. Have fun! If you need help message me.
