## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
my iPhone doesn't want to connect to cellular.
First I replaced all the antennas.
Still not working.
I accidentally pressed on the sim card reader and then the connection came back.
Only for a couple seconds.
If the sim card reader would be broken why does it ask for the PIN code. The cellular comes back only if I press on the sim card reader with my thumb but only for 3s.

 Bend the pins up a tiny bit, only like 2mm. See if it stays working then.

 Perhaps you can try to remove the sim card and place it back in? If that doesn't work, try the following steps:

 My simcard is already expired so can i ask if   simcard reader is the way to see the sms?
