## Chosen Solution
 When I charge my MacBook, I get the amber and green light to show it is charging. However, one day the MacBook turned off and won’t turn back on. My confusion is sometimes it does turn on, like randomly. I’ll walk by it and hold the power button just to see and then it’ll chime and turn on. When it turns on, it works fine. I can close it to sleep, open it and it comes back on. It’s as if nothing happend, until it dies or randomly shuts off again. Otherwise, nothing happens, no chime or anything. No physical damage or water damage at all, even took it to Apple store to make sure.

 You’ll need to do a bit of testing here to see if you can isolate out the cause. I’m thinking the keyboard switch is failing. If you can turn the system on using the power pads located just above the AirPort board as marked here:

So the next time it fails to start pop the bottom off and carefully short across these two pads you should only need to do a quick touch. If that fails then we need to look a the power rails using a volt meter. Even still you’ll likely need to send your system into someone who has access to the needed parts and tools to do the micro-soldering or you’re talking about a new logic board.
