But one common problem that plagues many Impreza owners is damage to their wheels. Whether it’s from curbs, potholes, or general wear and tear, damaged wheels can be a frustrating, expensive problem.\nBut fear not, Subaru enthusiasts! A new repair guide, released in 2015, reveals just how easy it is to fix your Impreza WRX wheels. You won’t believe how simple and affordable it can be.\nFirstly, it’s important to assess the damage to your wheels. Is it a small scratch or crack? Or are your wheels completely bent and in need of replacement? This will determine the course of action you need to take.\nFor minor scratches and scuffs, a simple touch-up paint can do the trick. Subaru offers touch-up paint that matches the original color of your wheels perfectly. This can be applied with a small brush and will fill in any cracks or scratches, making your wheels look as good as new.\nWhen it comes to more significant damage, such as bent or cracked wheels, many WRX owners assume that replacement is the only option. However, this is not always the case. A new repair process, called wheel straightening, can often be used to fix bent wheels.\nWheel straightening works by using specialized machinery to apply pressure to the wheel, reshaping it back to its original form. This process can often be done at a fraction of the cost of replacement wheels, and is just as effective.\nMany Subaru dealerships offer this service, and it typically only takes a few hours to complete. This means you could have your Impreza WRX back on the road in no time, without breaking the bank.\nIn addition to wheel straightening, there are also many aftermarket companies that offer custom wheel repair services. These services can range from simple refinishing to more advanced repairs, such as welding and reshaping.\nThese companies can offer unique finishes and designs that may not be available from Subaru. This is a great option for Impreza WRX owners who want to add a personalized touch to their wheels.\nAll in all, repairing and maintaining your Impreza WRX wheels is a straightforward process that doesn’t have to cost you an arm and a leg. With the help of this 2015 repair guide, you can keep your wheels looking sharp and functioning properly for years to come.\nSo don’t let damaged wheels bring you down. Take advantage of these easy, affordable repair options and get back to enjoying your Subaru Impreza WRX to the fullest.\nDifficulty\nModerate\nSteps\n10\nTime Required\n45 minutes - 2 hours Sections\n1\nWheels 10 steps Flags\n2\nIn Progress This guide is a work in progress.
