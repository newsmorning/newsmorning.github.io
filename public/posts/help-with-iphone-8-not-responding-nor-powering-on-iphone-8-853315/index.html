Are you one of the iPhone 8 users who have encountered a very frustrating issue of your phone not turning on? It can be quite alarming to realize that your phone is not working, especially if you need it for important tasks. However, before you panic, it is crucial to understand why this happens and how you can fix it.\nAfter thorough research and consultation with iPhone experts, we have uncovered some shocking reasons why your iPhone 8 won’t turn on. But, more importantly, we will guide you on how to solve this problem quickly.\nPossible Causes of iPhone 8 Not Turning On Battery Issue The most common reason for an iPhone 8 not turning on is a battery issue. In some cases, the battery drains completely, and the device will not turn on until it is recharged. However, there can be a glitch in the system that stops the battery from charging, making your phone totally unresponsive.\nBroken Charging Port or Cable Sometimes, an iPhone 8 not turning on could be due to a damaged charging cable or the port. The charging port is where you plug in the charger, while the cable is what connects the charger to the phone. If either of these is damaged, you will not be able to charge or turn on your iPhone 8.\nSoftware Issues Another possible reason why your iPhone 8 won’t turn on is a software problem. This can happen if there is a bug or malware in your iPhone’s operating system that triggers a shutdown or prevent it from turning on.\nHow to Fix Your iPhone 8 Not Turning On Check the Charger and Charging Port/Cable The first thing to do is to eliminate charging problems. Ensure your charger is not faulty and the charging port/cable is in good condition. Try using a different cable or charger and check if the charging indicator comes on. Alternatively, use a different outlet to see if the charger is the problem.\nPerform a Forced Restart A forced restart can solve most software issues on your iPhone. Press and hold the Volume Up button, and then press and release the Volume Down button quickly. Next, press and hold the side button until the Apple logo appears. Release the button and wait for your iPhone to reboot.\nDFU Restore If the above solutions fail, use the DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode to restore your iPhone 8. This is an advanced solution, so ensure you follow the steps correctly. Connect your iPhone 8 to a computer and launch iTunes. Press and hold the side button and Volume Down button for eight seconds, and then release the side button while still holding the volume button down. If done correctly, a message should appear on iTunes indicating that it has detected an iPhone in Recovery mode. Choose the option to restore your iPhone.\nContact Apple Support If none of the above solutions fix your iPhone 8, it’s time to seek professional help. Reach out to Apple support for assistance. They will guide you through the steps or recommend a repair service.\nFinal Thoughts\nA non-responsive iPhone 8 can be quite frustrating, but before you start panicking, try the simple solutions outlined above. If you’re still experiencing the problem, reach out to Apple support for further assistance. Remember, it is always essential to keep your device up-to-date, as software updates often address bugs and security issues that could affect your iPhone’s performance.\nChosen Solution I’ve got an iPhone 8 that worked fine, it had no issues with booting, running or charging. The screen was slightly cracked and the glass on the back case. It was dropped. But like I said everything ran fine for a long time. I ordered a new screen original and the back housing. (The back housing I ordered was with all small parts and components but they later messaged me it was out of stock so I said cool just send me the housing and I’ll transfer all the small parts over). So the back housing came and I transferred everything over. When I went to boot up the phone to turn it on it went into boot loop. Turned it off, re checked everything and found the very small flex plug which I believe is the Antenna flex to be broken. (I have attached a photo of it so you can see which one I’m talking about). After trying to turn the phone on again it did not respond or turn on. I found it strange that one second its in boot loop and next second its unresponsive. So I measured the voltage in the battery, was fine 4.13 v. I tried plugging power into the charging port and neither did the charging logo appear on the screen. Nothing at all. So I’m thinking: 1- Screen cant be dead cause it just worked. 2- Tried plugging it into itunes encase screen was dead but phone was on (that was not the case itunes did not detect it so phone was off). 3- Battery is fine as tested with multi-meter. I have tested all the pins by known good readings for the J6400. Most where fine apart for these which I found a bit high. Pin 6 - 0.802 Pin 8 - 0.802 Pin 20 - 0.805 Pin 22 - 0.802 Pin 24 - 0.802 Pin 25 - 0.721 Pin 26 - 0.907 Pin 27 - 0.721 Pin 39 - 0.612 Pin 41 - 0.612 (All diode readings) And maybe 50, 53, 54 and 56 (all at 2.32) is a bit high what do you think? From your experience by the readings I provided do you think there is an issue with the U2700 power IC? Or could it be an issue with the original charging port when it was removed and put back into new housing?? What I have done is ordered a new housing with all small elements already installed. If that does not resolve the issue will try replacing the power IC. I know that it regulates power to the phone and also charging, so if the phone is unresponsive it could be due to this. Please let me know your opinion on all this. I appreciate it. Update (09/27/2020)\nHere is the picture I forgot to post\nHere is J6400. I don’t know where you got J4101 from. If you are trying to sort out a charging problem you are looking in the wrong spot.\nHousing replacements are notoriously difficult. The ones that come pre-populated can have low quality, if not outright defective flexes and doing it yourself exposes you to a ton of variable if things dont work. As for your diode readings, the ones you have to worry about are low numbers or shorts (except for ground ;-). Did you put the red probe on ground and probe with the black lead? Your numbers seem high. I would start by testing a bare-bones setup. Start by disconnecting the battery first (always!). Then disconnect the digitizer, LCD, front camera, rear camera and home button extension flex. Now re-connect the battery; you should only have the battery and Lightning Dock flex connected. Connect a known-good, preferably Apple-original Lightning cable to an iTunes enabled computer. Does iTunes recognize your phone? If so, then you should re-connect one flex at a time until the phone stops working. I would start with the Home button flex first, then add the rear camera, LCD \u0026 Digitizer then from camera flex. If the bare-bones setup does not get recognized by iTunes, then you most likely have a logic board issue. You could send it (or find a local) to a repair shop that specializes in micro-soldering repair.\n","wordCount":"1300","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Roy Rumsey"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/help-with-iphone-8-not-responding-nor-powering-on-iphone-8-853315/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Discover the Shocking Reason Why Your iPhone 8 Won't Turn On - and How to Fix It FAST!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 7, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1300 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Roy Rumsey</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#possible-causes-of-iphone-8-not-turning-on>Possible Causes of iPhone 8 Not Turning On</a><ul><li><a href=#battery-issue>Battery Issue</a></li><li><a href=#broken-charging-port-or-cable>Broken Charging Port or Cable</a></li><li><a href=#software-issues>Software Issues</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#how-to-fix-your-iphone-8-not-turning-on>How to Fix Your iPhone 8 Not Turning On</a><ul><li><a href=#check-the-charger-and-charging-portcable>Check the Charger and Charging Port/Cable</a></li><li><a href=#perform-a-forced-restart>Perform a Forced Restart</a></li><li><a href=#dfu-restore>DFU Restore</a></li><li><a href=#contact-apple-support>Contact Apple Support</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=discover-the-shocking-reason-why-your-iphone-8-wont-turn-on---and-how-to-fix-it-fast>Discover the Shocking Reason Why Your iPhone 8 Won&rsquo;t Turn On - and How to Fix It FAST!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discover-the-shocking-reason-why-your-iphone-8-wont-turn-on---and-how-to-fix-it-fast>#</a></h1><p>Are you one of the iPhone 8 users who have encountered a very frustrating issue of your phone not turning on?
