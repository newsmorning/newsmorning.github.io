# Transform Your Astroneer Gaming Experience with These Jaw-Dropping Graphics Tweaks!

Astroneer, the sandbox adventure game developed and published by System Era Softworks, has been one of the popular indie games in the gaming community since its release in 2016. The game offers an open-world exploration gameplay experience set in outer space.

The game comes with stunning visuals and graphics suitable for different platforms such as PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. However, Astroneer's graphics can be improved, and gamers can enjoy even better visuals. In this article, we will share some graphics tweaks that will transform your Astroneer gaming experience into a jaw-dropping one.

## Update Your GPU Drivers

Before you start tweaking the settings, it's vital to ensure that your graphics card is up-to-date with the latest drivers as it can impact the game's overall performance. Having the latest drivers installed for your GPU will provide the best performance and stability for your gaming experience.

## Adjust the Visual Settings

To boost your Astroneer game visuals, you need to tweak the game's graphic settings. By navigating to the game's "Settings" menu, you can adjust the following settings:

- Anti-Aliasing: This setting smoothens the edges of objects in the game. Increasing the Anti-Aliasing will give a polished look to the game graphics.
 
- Field of View (FOV): This setting is responsible for how much you can see on the screen. Increasing the FOV will enable you to see more of the game while reducing it will offer a more focused view.

- Resolution: Depending on your computer's hardware, adjusting the resolution can help improve the game's visuals.

- Shadow Quality: The Shadow Quality setting affects the game's lighting effects. Increasing the quality level will create more realistic shadows.

## Refresh Rate, V-Sync, and FPS

Astroneer gameplay experience can be enhanced by enabling G-Sync, FreeSync, or V-Sync, depending on the hardware supported by your computer. These settings ensure that the game frame rate is in sync with your monitor's refresh rate. This feature eliminates screen tearing and reduces input lag. To use this feature, navigate to the "Settings" menu in the game and enable V-Sync, G-Sync, or FreeSync.

You can also increase the frame rate by changing the 'MaxFramerate' setting in the game files. Navigating to the game files on your computer, locate the "Astro\Astro\Astro\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor" directory, find the GameUserSettings.ini file, and change the following settings:

     -- bSmoothFrameRate=false to bSmoothFrameRate=true
     -- FrameRateLimit=0 to FrameRateLimit=120

Changing these settings will provide smoother gameplay and improve the visuals.

## Using Third-Party Software

Using software like SweetFX and ReShade can enhance the Astroneer gaming experience by adding various post-processing effects. These software adjust the image color, contrast, and visual effects, giving a more realistic look to the game visuals.

## Conclusion

Playing Astroneer with the default graphics settings offers an engaging gaming experience. However, by applying these graphics tweaks, the game visuals can transform into a breathtaking and immersive one. From adjusting the game settings to using third-party software, these tweaks will unlock the game's full potential and immerse you in the space exploration adventure.
