Is Your PC Giving You Headaches? Find Out Why It's Running At High Ms Only!

Many computer users often complain about their PC running slowly, taking a lot of time to startup or responding to clicks late. One of the major reasons for this issue is that the PC is running at a high millisecond (ms) only. In this article, we will discuss what this means and how you can solve it.

Understanding Millisecond (ms)

A millisecond is a unit of time that equals one thousandth of a second. In computers, it is used to measure how long it takes for the system to respond to an action. The lower the ms, the faster your PC is. The ideal ms for a desktop computer is 1ms, which is practically non-existent since it involves lightning-fast speeds. However, anything below 10ms is considered good.

Why Your PC Is Running At High Ms Only?

The common reasons why your PC is running at high ms only include low RAM, outdated hardware or software, too many applications running simultaneously, and viruses or malware infections. If you have been using your PC for a while, there is a high probability that it has accumulated various junk files, corrupted registers, and temporary files that are slowing it down.

How To Fix Your PC Running At High Ms Only?

Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to fix your PC running at a high ms only. Here are some of them:

1. Check the Task Manager

The first step is to check the Task Manager, a computer program that displays the active processes, memory usage, and processor utilization. It can help you pinpoint which applications or processes are causing your PC to run at a high ms. Once you have identified the culprit, you can end the process or disable the application to enable other processes to run seamlessly.

2. Update your hardware and software

Outdated hardware or software can cause your PC to slow down. Make sure you keep everything up-to-date to ensure maximum performance. Preferably, upgrade your RAM, video card, CPU, and hard drive for better speed and responsiveness.

3. Remove unnecessary files

As mentioned earlier, junk files and temporary files can slow down your PC. Remove any unnecessary files, such as temporary internet files, recycle bin items, and old backups, etc. Use antivirus software to scan your PC and remove any viruses or malware infections.

4. Disable unnecessary startup programs

Having too many startup programs can cause your PC to load slowly. You can disable unnecessary startup programs to speed things up. To disable a startup program, go to Task Manager, select Startup, and click on Disable.

5. Clean the registry

An overloaded registry can also slow down your PC. Clean it up using a registry cleaner software or do it manually regularly.

Final Thoughts

Your PC running at a high ms only can be quite frustrating, but it is usually due to software or hardware issues. By following the simple steps discussed above, you can quickly fix the issue and get your PC working efficiently again. Regular maintenance and cleaning can also help keep your PC running at optimal performance.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello guys.
I just build a new PC for a friend and Iâ€™ve noticed a problem. When I play offline games everything is Perfect, but when I play an online game ms are getting crazy. I thought at first that the problem was with the internet connection but later I tried with another pc to play the same game and I had 21ms instead of 300ms I had with the new PC. What can be the problem with the new PC and gets so high ms?

 Maybe your router prioritizes your pc to a very low state. Try to log in your router and search for the QOS and set your pc to high priority. Or maybe try restarting the router before you try this.
