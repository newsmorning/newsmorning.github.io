Title: Are You Stuck with Only Google Sites? 5 Expert Tips to Get Unstuck in 2023!

Introduction
Google Sites is one of the simplest and easiest ways to create a website, especially for beginners. With a simple interface and drag-and-drop tools, it is the go-to choice for many small businesses and individuals. However, as the digital world evolves, some users may find themselves feeling stuck with the limited functionality of Google Sites. In this article, we will outline 5 expert tips to help those stuck with Google Sites get unstuck in 2023.

1. Add custom design elements
Google Sites has a limited selection of design elements and templates, but that doesn't mean your website has to look generic. One way to add some personality and pizzazz to your site is to use custom design elements. You can create your unique logo, choose unique fonts, and create graphics using tools like Canva. Additionally, you can hire a graphic designer to create custom elements like banners and icons that you can use on your site.

2. Integrate with other tools
Just because you are using Google Sites doesn't mean you have to miss out on the functionality of other tools. For example, you can integrate your site with Google Analytics to track your website's performance. You can add a calendar tool like Calendly to schedule appointments with clients. You can also add social media buttons to your site to link to your accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

3. Customize your URL
By default, a Google Site will have a URL format like "sites.google.com/view/[website-name]." This format is not very catchy or professional-looking. By purchasing a domain name and connecting it to your Google Site, you can create a custom URL that is easier to remember and looks more professional. For example, you can purchase your brand name at a domain registrar like Namecheap or GoDaddy and connect it to your Google Site.

4. Enhance your content
Google Sites provides a basic text editor for creating content on your website. However, you can take your content to the next level by using multimedia elements like videos, images, and audio. You can link to videos hosted on YouTube or Vimeo, embed podcasts from platforms like Soundcloud, and add high-quality images to make your content more engaging and visually appealing.

5. Consider using a multi-platform approach
If you find yourself frustrated with the limited functionality of Google Sites, you might want to consider a multi-platform approach. By using several tools, you can create a website presence that is more customized to your needs. For example, you can use WordPress for your blog, Shopify for your e-commerce store, and Google Sites for your portfolio. By using several different platforms, you can take advantage of the unique features of each tool and create a more comprehensive website presence.

Conclusion
Google Sites is an excellent tool for creating a website, but it is not the only tool out there. By using the tips outlined in this article, you can enhance your site, make it more professional, and break free from feeling stuck. Whether you use Google Sites exclusively, or incorporate it into a multi-platform approach, the key is to find what works best for you and your business. So, get creative, experiment with new tools and approaches, and watch your website presence soar in 2023!

Some users have posted on support forums about an interesting issue in which only Google sites work, such as Google.com and YouTube, in their browsers.
 
## Have you tried opening your sites in another browser?
 
- Your Internet connection is fine but only Google and YouTube sites work so it might be a problem with your browser.If you can only access Google sites try opening the websites in another browser.The issue can be fixed by manually changing the DNS settings.Switching the Windows Firewall to default settings can also resolve this problem.

Aside from Google sites, no other websites open even though there’s an internet connection. One user stated in a forum post:
 
This problem has been very common for all types of users. So, we have come up with some important information along with effective solutions.
 
The computer is saying I’m connected to the internet, but only Google.com is working on both IE and Chrome. On other websites, I’m getting the message This page can’t be displayed.
 
## Why can’t I access any website except Google?
 
It is hard to tell you the reasons precisely. But, after doing some research on this issue, we have found some common reasons which were directly causing this problem in most cases. Here are they:
 
- The DNS server address you are using may be going through some problems.
 - A security rule on your Firewall may be blocking all websites except Google search.
 - Your router may have some problem that needs to be sorted out.
 - You have made changes to your network settings on your computer.
 - An internet problem is going on your ISP’s network.

 
Why is my internet only working on some Sites?
 
The same reasons why you can only visit Google’s website are applicable for this case too. You may be able to visit only a few websites because of the issues mentioned above.
 
As you already know what may cause this type of problem, it should be easy to troubleshoot now. We have already prepared some solutions that can fix the problem we have been talking about. These solutions are applicable for the following errors as well:
 
- Only Google sites work windows 10/11
 - Only Google sites work on Mac
 - The device is loading Google’s sites only
 - Only Google sites work on android
 - PC is not loading any sites except Google search
 - Only Google sites work on iPhone
 - Only Google sites work tp-link

 
Quick Tip:
 
Instead of trying to troubleshoot your current browser, save some time and try using a more stable alternative, like Opera.
 
It’s built on a Chromium engine, like many mainstream browsers, so you’ll get a similar experience, minus the bugs. You can easily transfer all your data, in case you decide to keep it as your default browser.
 
## What can I do if I can only access Google sites?
 
### 1. Change the DNS Settings
 
- Press Win + I on the keyboard to open Windows Settings.
 - Click on Network & Internet.
 - Go to Ethernet or Wi-Fi, depending on the connection you are using.
 - Click on the Edit next to the DNS server assignment.
 - Now, type your preferred DNS server addresses. Usually, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google DNS) is best for all-purpose.
 - Click on Save.

 
A lot of users have fixed the error by changing their DNS to Google DNS so give it a shot by following the steps above. 
 
###  Opera 
 
  Enjoy fast, secure, and private browsing with this lighting-fast browser!  
 
If you see that only Google and YouTube work even after setting the Google’s DNS, we suggest you use something else like Open DNS or Cloudflare DNS.
 
Open DNS address: 208.67. 222.222 and 208.67. 220.220
 
Cloudflare DNS address: 1.1.1.1
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.

These are very popular and work really well. You can use something else too to solve the problem.
 
### 2. Restore the Windows Firewall to default
 
- Open the start menu, type Windows Defender Firewall, and hit enter to open it.
 - Click on Restore defaults.
 - Next, click on Restore defaults on the new window.

 
Windows Defender Firewall can be blocking the websites that you are trying to access, so restoring it to the default settings might fix the issue for some users.
 
### 3. Reboot the router
 
Rebooting the router is another potential solution. Unplug the router from power for at least 10 seconds and plug it back in. Wait for it to reboot (it usually takes about 30 seconds)
 
You need to know that until the router reboots, your connection will drop for all the devices that were connected.
 
You can also reset the router to its factory settings by using the dedicated reset button that you will find somewhere on its back. 
 
But keep in mind that you will have to reconfigure the router with the settings from your ISP.
 
If you can only access Google sites or just a few websites, rebooting or resetting the router may also work like a magic.
 
### 4. Reset TCP/IP
 
- Press Windows key + S, and type cmd in the search tab.
 - Click on Run as administrator to start Command Prompt with elevated privileges.
 - Then input the following commands separately and press Enter after each one:
 - netsh winsock reset catalognetsh int ipv4 reset reset.lognetsh int ipv6 reset reset.log
 - Close Command Prompt after entering each of the above commands.
 - Restart Windows.

 
Users have also confirmed that resetting TCP/IP can also fix the problem only Google sites work. To do that, follow the steps above.
 
- netsh winsock reset catalognetsh int ipv4 reset reset.lognetsh int ipv6 reset reset.log

 
### 5. Use a VPN
 
If you still see that only Google sites work on your computer, using a VPN can be a great idea. If there is something wrong with your ISP or even your country’s network for some reason, you should consider using a VPN.
 
In this case, we recommend Private Internet Access (PIA). This VPN has a massive global network with 35000+ servers. In many cases, it can improve your internet browsing and streaming experience.
