Is Your JBL Charge 2 Plus Playing Tricks on You? Find Out How to Fix Distorted Sound at Low Volume Now!

If you are a music enthusiast, you know the importance of sound quality. The JBL Charge 2 Plus is an incredible Bluetooth speaker that produces high-quality sound. However, sometimes, you might experience distorted sound at low volume levels. It can be frustrating when your favorite music is distorted, and you are not getting the intended audio experience. But don't fret! In this article, we'll explore some of the reasons why you might get distorted sound on your JBL Charge 2 Plus and how to fix it.

Before delving into the solution, here are the reasons why you might experience distorted sound at low volume levels.

Loudness Equalization

Most modern devices come with an audio setting called "Loudness Equalization." This feature boosts the volume of the audio while simultaneously applying compression. The effect of this can lead to distorted sound, particularly when playing music at low volume levels.

Bluetooth Interference

Bluetooth is sensitive to interference from other devices or signals. Any electronic device that uses similar frequency signals can interfere with your Bluetooth connection. This interference can cause data loss, resulting in disrupted sound output from your speaker.

EQ Settings

If you are a music enthusiast, you might have tested your speaker's EQ settings to suit your preferences or room acoustics. However, wrong EQ settings, particularly aggressive bass boost, can lead to distorted sound.

How to Fix Distorted Sound

Now that you know the possible causes let's focus on how to fix distorted sound at low volume levels on your JBL Charge 2 Plus.

Disable Loudness Equalization

If your JBL Charge 2 Plus is connected to a Windows PC, the Loudness Equalization setting might be enabled by default. Here's how to disable Loudness Equalization:

1. Right-click on the volume icon located on your taskbar.
2. Select "Playback devices."
3. Right-click on the JBL Charge 2 Plus speaker and choose "Properties."
4. In the "Enhancements" tab, uncheck the "Loudness Equalization" box.
5. Click "Apply" then "OK."

This should improve the sound quality of your JBL Charge 2 Plus.

Move Your Speaker Away from Other Electronics

Bluetooth interference can cause distorted sound. Moving your JBL Charge 2 Plus to an area free from electronic interference can resolve the problem. Try changing your speaker's location, and you might find that the distorted sound disappears.

Adjust EQ Settings

If you have increased the bass or treble using the EQ settings, consider resetting it to the default setting. To reset the EQ settings to default, follow these steps:

1. Press and hold the "Volume up" and "Play" buttons for at least five seconds.
2. Your JBL Charge 2 Plus will beep to indicate that the EQ has been reset.

Conclusion

In conclusion, distorted sound at low volume levels can ruin your listening experience, but you can resolve it. If your JBL Charge 2 Plus is playing tricks on you, be sure to disable Loudness Equalization, move your speaker away from electronics or adjust EQ settings to improve sound quality. With these tips, you can get the best audio experience from your JBL Charge 2 Plus Bluetooth speaker.
