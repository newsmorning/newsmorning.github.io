# MacBook Pro 13 Upgrade Nightmare: Sierra Stopped Working and I'm Stuck - Find out what to do now!

As an owner of a MacBook Pro 13, I recently experienced a nightmare scenario that left me stuck with a non-functional laptop. It all began when I attempted to upgrade to the latest version of macOS Sierra. The installation process seemed to be running smoothly, but before it could complete, my laptop suddenly shut down. When I tried to restart it, I was met with a message telling me that the installation had failed and that I needed to reinstall the previous version of macOS.

Unfortunately, when I tried to do so, I encountered another problem. My MacBook Pro would not boot up at all, and I was left staring at a blank screen. After several attempts to start it up, I realized that I was facing a serious problem that required urgent attention.

After doing some research online, I discovered that I was not alone in my struggles. Many MacBook Pro users had faced similar issues after upgrading to Sierra. Some had even reported that their laptops were rendered completely unusable, with no hope of recovery.

But all hope was not lost. I was able to find a workaround that allowed me to restore my MacBook Pro to its previous state, and I want to share it with other MacBook Pro users who may be facing similar problems.

Here is what I did:

1. Press and hold the power button for about 10 seconds until your MacBook Pro turns off.

2. Press the power button again to turn on your MacBook Pro.

3. Immediately press and hold the Command (⌘) + R keys on your keyboard until the Apple logo appears.

4. Release the keys and wait until your MacBook Pro boots up in Recovery mode.

5. In Recovery mode, select the "Disk Utility" option and choose your startup disk.

6. Click on the "First Aid" tab and select "Repair Disk" to fix any issues that may be causing your MacBook Pro to malfunction.

7. Once the repair process is complete, restart your MacBook Pro and try to reinstall macOS Sierra again.

This worked for me, and I was able to successfully reinstall the previous version of macOS without any further issues. However, if you're still having problems after following these steps, it's best to seek the help of a professional.

In conclusion, upgrading to the latest version of macOS can be a tricky process that can come with unexpected complications. If you find yourself in a situation where Sierra has stopped working, don't panic. Follow the steps outlined above, and you should be able to find a solution that gets your MacBook Pro up and running again.

## Chosen Solution
 I was trying to transfer my old iPhone backup onto my new iPhone and the upgrade to Sierra came up and stupidly I clicked yes. Well it said there was an issue and to try restarting, I tried 5 times and it wouldn’t work, I tried the repair option then reinstall OS X and it installed but when I went to load it said I couldn’t install as there was a newer version! Help I cannot load my mac and I desperately do not want to lose all my data.
Update (08/17/2018)
It’s a MacBook Pro 13”  I tried safe lad but nothing happened.  I don’t have another Mac, unfortunately.

 Did you try to load in safe mode? If it doesn’t work you need another mac to create bootable USB and instal it it from there. I think data will not be affected. If nothing else work you will have to install it clean.
You shouldn’t perform hard restart, but use terminal “sudo shutdown -r now” command.
