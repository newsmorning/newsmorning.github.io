192.168.1.1 is the standard IP address used by Linksys broadband routers, other brands of network routers, and home network gateway equipment. Network administrators use this address to set up a new router or update settings for an existing one. The same address can also be used on business computer networks.

 

Technically, a computer, printer, or another device could be programmed to use this address, but it's not recommended as it could cause IP address conflicts. 192.168.1.1 belongs to the private IP address range typically used for private networks. The private IP address range starts with 192.168.0.0 and extends through 192.168.255.255.

 
##   Connect to a Linksys Router Using 192.168.1.1  
 

It isn't always necessary to know your router's IP address. Phones and other devices can find the router by its name (SSID) whenever those devices need to get online. However, knowing the address becomes important when you set up a new router or troubleshoot a home network problem.

 
These steps apply to all routers that are accessible from a web browser. You can follow these directions from any browser on any computer—any differences are called out in the directions.
 

To connect to a router that has an IP address of 192.168.1.1, open a web browser, go to the address bar, and enter http://192.168.1.1/. Then, log in and connect to the router as an administrator and access its configuration screens.

 

The procedure may fail for the following reasons:

 
- The router has failed and is unresponsive to connections through the browser.The router is set up to use a different address and not 192.168.1.1.The computer and the router need to be on the same network to access it at this local address.

If you can't connect to 192.168.1.1, there are a few things you can try to get reconnected.

 
If you can log into the router with the default administrator ID and password, the router is poorly secured, and anyone could log into it. Change the router's admin password to secure the router.
 
- Check your connection. If you're trying to connect to 192.168.1.1 from your phone or another wireless device, make sure you're connected to the same network that the router is on.
 - Restart the router. It's not uncommon for there to be temporary hiccups in the router software that are cleared when the router is rebooted. Complete this step even if you think something this simple won't work; it's uncomplicated and should be followed before some of the more drawn-out steps below.
 - Search the network for the router's IP address. If the router isn't using the 192.168.1.1 address, it could be 192.168.0.1, 192.168.2.1, or something entirely different. Learn how to find your default gateway if you're on a computer, or try the What's Your Router IP? online tool if you're using a phone.
 - Search the web for the maker of the router. Use their support or search tool to find your specific router model. There should be a manual there that provides the router's default IP address.
 - Reset the router. This will erase all customizations that have been made to it, a procedure that will eliminate the router software as a reason for why you can't connect to 192.168.1.1.
 - Never reset a router unless you know the default administrative ID and password for the router. Otherwise, you could be locked out of the router permanently.
