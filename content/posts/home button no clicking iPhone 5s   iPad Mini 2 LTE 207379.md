Title: iPhone 5S and iPad Mini 2 LTE users shocked as Home button mysteriously stops clicking - read now to discover the bizarre solution!

Are you one of the many iPhone 5S or iPad Mini 2 LTE users who was suddenly caught off guard when your Home button mysteriously stopped clicking? Don't worry, you're not alone. This bizarre issue has been reported by a significant number of owners of these devices. But the good news is that there's a quick and easy solution that you can try yourself.

The Home button is an essential component of any iPhone or iPad. It's used for several critical functions such as waking up the device, returning to the Home screen, accessing Siri, and much more. It's designed to be highly responsive, providing tactile feedback to let the user know that their command has been acknowledged.

So, what happens when the Home button suddenly stops clicking? The first thing you might think is that the button has simply worn out from repeated use. After all, the Home button is one of the most frequently used buttons on the device. But in this case, the issue is entirely different.

If you're one of the affected users, you may have noticed that your Home button still works, but it doesn't produce the familiar clicking sound or vibration when you press it. It feels like it's stuck, and there's no tactile feedback. Some users even thought their device was malfunctioning or unresponsive.

The cause of this bizarre issue is something that you might never have suspected. It turns out that it's all down to a simple software glitch. Specifically, it's related to the way that the devices handle the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which is located within the Home button.

The solution to this problem is surprisingly straightforward. All you need to do is follow these simple steps:

1. Open any built-in app on your device, such as the Calculator or Calendar.
2. Hold down the Power button until the "slide to power off" option appears.
3. Release the Power button.
4. Hold down the Home button for around five seconds or until the app completely closes.
5. Your Home button should now be back to normal, clicking and vibrating as it should.

It's still unclear why this issue affects some iPhone 5S and iPad Mini 2 LTE devices and not others. But what's clear is that the solution is one of the easiest and most straightforward fixes you can do. And what's even better is that you don't need any special tools or technical expertise to get your Home button clicking again.

In conclusion, if you're one of the unlucky iPhone 5S or iPad Mini 2 LTE users who's been experiencing this mysterious Home button issue, don't worry. The solution is quick and easy, and you won't have to spend a lot of money for repairs or replacements. Follow the simple steps we've outlined, and your device should be back to normal in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I have to replace the screen on my ipad the digitizer is messing up.  the screen comes with the digitizer right?
Also need to repair the home button the button looks and moves but the switch is not clicking is there a repair package i can buy for the home button?

 You can buy the front panel full assembly from us at iFixit.  It comes with everything including the home button.  Which iPad do you have my brotha?

 Yes just order a assembly. The home button just needs adjusting . Be careful when taking up the Lcd to remove the digitizer connector its adhesived down if you don't take your time, heat it constantly while sliding something super thin under it.  It will break and you wont know until you turn it on.
