# Never Get Caught in the Rain Again! Learn How to Replace Your 2020 Dodge Charger's Windshield Wipers Like a Pro!

Are you tired of constantly getting drenched in the rain because your windshield wipers are not doing their job as they should? Or maybe you are tired of the annoying sound they make when they are worn out? Perhaps you have even tried to replace them before, but you failed miserably. Fear not, because in this article, we will show you how to replace your 2020 Dodge Charger's windshield wipers like a pro!

### The Tools You Will Need

First of all, before you start replacing your windshield wipers, you need to make sure you have all the necessary tools at your disposal. Thankfully, this is a straightforward procedure that requires only a few basic items. These items include:

- A new set of windshield wipers suitable for your 2020 Dodge Charger model 
- A soft cloth or towel 
- A flathead screwdriver 
- A pair of pliers

### Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you are fully equipped with the necessary tools, it's time to get down to business. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to replace your 2020 Dodge Charger's windshield wipers like a pro:

1. First, gently lift the old wiper blades away from the windshield until they lock into the open position.

2. Use your flathead screwdriver to locate the locking tab or tab release button on the wiper blade connector. Push or slide the tab and then pull the old wiper blade away from the connector.

3. Take your set of pliers and remove the metal retaining clip that sits at the base of the wiper arm. Make sure to do this gently and avoid damaging the arm itself.

4. Take your new wiper blade and insert it into the wiper arm, making sure the connector or adapter is carefully aligned with the arm. Securely attach the blade to the connector or adapter.

5. Finally, ensure that the new wiper blade is securely in place by testing it. Lower the wiper blade slowly onto the windshield, and ensure that it wipes the windshield correctly.

6. Repeat the same process for the other wiper blade.

### Tips for Best Results

Before you go out there to fill your car with confidence, here are a couple of tips that will help you achieve the best results possible:

- Always replace your windshield wipers at least once every six months for optimal performance.

- Never attempt to replace any wiper blades while the engine and wipers are in operation. Always ensure that the wipers are turned off before starting any replacement process.

- Clean your windshield regularly to avoid damaging your new windshield wipers.

- Ensure that you have a suitable replacement wiper blade that is compatible with your 2020 Dodge Charger model.

In conclusion, by following this step-by-step guide, you can say goodbye to faulty windshield wipers that leave you drenched in the rain. Remember to always inspect your windshield wipers regularly and replace them as needed to ensure maximum visibility while driving. With this knowledge, you will never get caught in the rain again!

## Introduction
 
Ineffective wiper blades are prone to Streaking, Smearing, Squeaking and Chattering, and are an easy way to tell if they need to be changed, according to Crossings Motor Centre.
 
- Streaking: Streaks of water remain after each swipeSmearing: Areas have water dragged over resulting in unwiped regionsSqueaking: Wiper blades are not quiet when moving acrossChattering: Blades vibrate over the windscreen, causing skipped spots

 
Information in this guide applies to both wiper blades on the front and back of the 2020 Dodge Charger. Though many cars follow a similar replacement process, all the steps covered will not necessarily work for other vehicle brands and models.
 
Before beginning this guide, be sure to turn off your car and engage the parking brake.
