If you're a website owner, you're likely familiar with Cloudflare. A Content Delivery Network (CDN) that improves your website's speed and security, Cloudflare is an essential tool for many businesses. However, users often come across a frustrating issue while using Cloudflare. The 'Checking your browser' warning message pops up, making it difficult to access websites that use it.

It's a problem that has affected a lot of people, but luckily, we have the solution. In this article, we'll show you 5 easy and effective methods to fix the 'Checking your browser' error on Cloudflare.

### Method 1: Try a Different Browser

One of the easiest fixes for the Cloudflare error is to switch to a different browser. While some users have reported the issue on a particular browser, others have found success with a different one. So, if you're using Chrome, try using Firefox or Edge. If you're not having any luck, try the next method.

### Method 2: Clear Your Browser Cache

Clearing your browser cache might do the trick. The cache can often store outdated data, which results in issues accessing websites. Here's how to do it for different browsers:

- Chrome: Go to Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data
- Firefox: Go to Options > Privacy & Security > Clear Data
- Safari: Go to Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data
- Edge: Go to Settings > Privacy, search and services > Choose what to clear

### Method 3: Disable Browser Extensions

Sometimes, browser extensions can cause issues with certain websites. So, disabling them temporarily can help you to access the website that's blocking you. Here's how to disable extensions on different browsers:

- Chrome: Click the three dots > More tools > Extensions > Toggle off/on the extension to disable/enable it
- Firefox: Click the three lines > Add-ons and Themes > Extensions > Toggle the extension to disable/enable it
- Safari: Click Safari > Preferences > Extensions > Uncheck the box next to the extension to disable it
- Edge: Click the three dots > Extensions > Turn the toggle off/on to disable/enable the extension

### Method 4: Reset Your Network Settings

If the above methods don't work, resetting your network settings can be a useful option. It can clear your DNS cache, which could have outdated IP addresses that can cause the Cloudflare error. Here's how to do it:

- Windows: Launch Command Prompt as an administrator > Type "ipconfig /flushdns" > Press Enter
- MAC: Launch Terminal > Type "sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder" > Press Enter

### Method 5: Check for Firewall Issues

Firewalls can block websites, and the Cloudflare error may be due to your computer's firewall. Check if it's causing the issue by temporarily disabling it. If you can successfully access the website after disabling the firewall, try adding the website to the whitelist. Here's how to disable a firewall on different operating systems:

- Windows: Press the Windows key + R > Type "firewall.cpl" > Press Enter > Choose "Turn Windows Firewall on or off"
- MAC: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Click the lock icon to make changes > Enter your password > Click "Turn Firewall Off"

In Conclusion

The 'Checking your browser' error on Cloudflare can be a frustrating issue, but there's no need to worry. By following these easy and effective methods, you should be able to access the website you need. So, try them out, and you'll be back to browsing in no time!

Cloudflare offers these services to websites that want to protect their servers from Denial-Of-Service (DDoS) and other types of cyber attacks.
 
Because of the size and power of Cloudflare, a DDoS attack would not work on their server. This allows other websites to use Cloudflare protection for a fee.
 
This article will explore the reasons for this happening and answer essential questions. 
 
## What is Cloudflare checking your browser?
 
Similar to Bad Behavior, the Cloudflare BIC (Browser Integrity Check) scans for standard HTTP headers that spammers often misuse and block access to your website if it finds any.
 
It also presents difficulties for user agents with malicious crawlers, bots, or users.
 
By default, Browser Integrity Check is turned on. You may deactivate the BIC as an administrator using a firewall bypass rule. Additionally, you may selectively activate or disable this functionality for certain areas of your website using a Page Rule.
 
Why does it say checking your browser before accessing?
 
If you see the Checking your browser message, it simply means that the website you’re trying to access hired CloudFlare to protect their page against DDoS attacks.
 
For this reason, a temporary page will be presented to you containing the message mentioned above, and at the same time, the servers are checking if your PC is genuine.
 
## How do I disable CloudFlare browser check?
 
### 1. Use an alternative browser
 
We recommend downloading and installing Opera on your device to protect your user data and block cyberattacks.
 
The sites protect their data by checking your IP, the type of packet sent to the website server, its size, and the rate at which they are received, along with other details. Opera offers a free and unlimited VPN, which helps mask your IP address. 
 
Moreover, with Opera, you get a built-in ad blocker so that you can navigate the internet with fewer distractions.
 
Let’s have a look at some more key functionalities:
 
- Data synchronization.
 - Easy to use search function through open tabs.
 - Integrated social media accounts.
 - Free VPN that ensures all your data is kept private.
 - Battery saver function.

 
### 2. Scan your PC
 
- Click on the Start menu, type windows security, and then select the Windows Security app.
 - Click on the Virus & threat protection option.
 - Select the Scan options menu.
 - Select Full scan from the list of options, then hit the Scan now button.
 - Wait for the scan to complete and see if the error message still appears.

 
### 3. Disable your browser extensions or add-ons
 
- Launch your browser.
 - Copy and paste the link below into your Address bar and hit Enter. chrome://extensions/
 - Toggle off the disable switch of your extensions, starting from your most recently installed extensions.
 - Check to see if the error message still appears.

 
### 4. Set your date and time to automatic
 
- Right-click on the date and time icon on your taskbar.
 - Select Adjust date and time.
 - Make sure the Set time automatically option is enabled.

 
Now you should verify if it is still checking the browser before granting website access.
 
###  Opera 
 
  Enjoy navigating the Internet without having your browser crashing multiple times!  
 
### 5. Use a VPN
 
Using a VPN masks your IP address, so you will not be affected if Cloudflare is restricting a specific IP or region.
 
Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, are used to link your computer to various locations across the globe safely. Choose one of the best VPNs for Windows if you don’t already use one.
 
### Cloudflare checking your browser loop
 
You should wait patiently when you are stuck in checking your browser before accessing a website. Most of the time, this will correct itself, and you will not have to take action.
 
If this becomes a loop, you should try any of the solutions listed in this article. A loop means that something is wrong with your browser or computer, and you will not be allowed access to the website until you resolve the problem. 
 
This article answers the question: Why is Cloudflare checking my browser? 
 
We can conclude that the Cloudflare browser check performed by some websites is not damaging in any way to your PC and is only performed to make sure your PC is real.
