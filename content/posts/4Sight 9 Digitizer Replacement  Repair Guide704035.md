Are you tired of using your 4Sight 9 with a damaged or unresponsive digitizer? Perhaps you have been wondering how to replace your digitizer without spending a lot of money on professional repair services. If that sounds like you, then you'll be pleased to know that replacing your 4Sight 9 digitizer is easier than you might have thought. In this article, we will present you with a step-by-step guide on how to replace your 4Sight 9 digitizer with ease. 

Step 1: Gather the Necessary Tools

Before you start the replacement process, you'll need to ensure you have all the necessary tools available. These include:

- A replacement 4Sight 9 digitizer. 
- A heat gun or hair dryer
- A spudger or plastic pry tool
- A small Phillips screwdriver 
- A pair of tweezers

Step 2: Prepare the Device

Firstly, disconnect the 4Sight 9 from any power sources and remove the battery. To remove the battery, first, use a Phillips screwdriver to unscrew the battery cover. Once the cover is loose, gently remove the battery from the device.

Step 3: Detach the Frame

Next, use a heat gun or hair dryer to heat the adhesive around the frame. Once the adhesive is soft, use the spudger or plastic pry tool to gently lift the frame away from the device's body.

Step 4: Remove the Damaged Digitizer

After detaching the frame completely, you'll prioritize any remaining adhesive and cables that connect to the digitizer. Once clean, you can then gently lift the damaged digitizer out of the device. 

Step 5: Install the Replacement Digitizer

Once the damaged digitizer is removed, you can insert the new digitizer into the device. Carefully line up the digitizer and secure it in place using the adhesive on the replacement digitizer.

Step 6: Reassemble the Device

After attaching the new digitizer, reattach the frame to the device's body, being sure to connect any remaining cables. Once the frame is in place, reconnect the battery and replace the battery cover. Finally, switch on the device and test the new digitizer to ensure it is functioning correctly.

Conclusion

You don't have to be a professional technician to replace your 4Sight 9 digitizer. With the right tools and careful instructions, replacing your damaged digitizer can be easily and cost-effectively completed. So, if you're faced with a damaged 4Sight 9 digitizer, follow these steps, and you'll have your device up and running with a new digitizer in no time.
