# Desperate Nintendo Switch owners rejoice! Discover the life-saving hack to remove 2 stubborn stripped backplate screws and save your console!

As a proud owner of the Nintendo Switch, it can be frustrating to have such a great console and not be able to enjoy it because of a minor setback like stripped screws on the backplate of the console. Stripped screws are a common problem among Switch owners, and this can happen when you over-tighten or when the screwdriver slips.

But worry no more, desperate Nintendo Switch owners! In this article, we’ll take a look at a life-saving hack that will remove those stubborn stripped backplate screws and save your console.

First, let's gather the tools you will need:

- A rubber band
- A screwdriver that can fit the stripped backplate screws
- Some pliers or tweezers
- A pair of scissors

Once you have all the necessary tools, follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Place the rubber band over the stripped screw

Loop the rubber band over the screwhead and press down firmly. Make sure the rubber band is secure on the screwhead, then turn the screwdriver to attempt to unscrew the stripped screw.

Step 2: Use pliers or tweezers to twist the screwdriver

If the rubber band is offering enough resistance to the stripped screw, it should grip it enough that you can slowly twist the screwdriver counterclockwise with the help of pliers or tweezers.

Step 3: Tighten the strip screw

If the screwdriver seems to be slipping or losing its grip, use some scissors to cut the rubber band and start the process again. Repeat as many times as necessary to tighten the stripped screws.

In conclusion, stripped screws can be a frustrating problem, but don't let them defeat you. The rubber band hack is an easy and effective way to remove those stubborn screws from the backplate of your Nintendo Switch. Try our tip, and enjoy gaming on your console again without worrying about any minor setbacks that come along the way!


## Chosen Solution
 I need to remove 2  switch Backplate screws and they are stripped, I tried the rubber band trick and nothing and I’m not too keen on using superglue, can anybody please help me?

 The best thing you can do in this situation is to purchase a small screw extractor kit and remove the screws that way. 
ive personally tried to superglue my cheap screwdrivers to the screw, but that doesn’t actually seem to work at all, at least for me. 
they seem too rounded out, and too small to use any other method, so I’d say get a screw extractor kit.
