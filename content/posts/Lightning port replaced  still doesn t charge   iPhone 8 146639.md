# Shocking News: Lightning Port Replacement Fails to Charge iPhone 8 – Is Your Device at Risk?

If you own an iPhone 8, you might want to be extra cautious about getting the lightning port replaced. Recent reports have surfaced that replacing the lightning port can result in the phone being unable to charge.

The issue seems to stem from a security feature that Apple has installed in the iPhone 8. When the lightning port is replaced, the phone no longer recognizes it as genuine, and therefore refuses to charge from it. This happens even if the lightning port is replaced with a genuine Apple part.

The problem was first reported by an iPhone repair shop in Norway. The owner of the shop, Aakre Thomas, became aware of the issue when he noticed that some iPhone 8s that had had their lightning ports replaced were unable to charge. He tested a number of different aftermarket lightning ports and found that they all had the same issue.

Since then, reports of this problem have been coming in from all over the world. In the US, a user on Reddit reported that his iPhone 8 stopped charging after he had the lightning port replaced. Closer to home, a user on a Singaporean forum also reported the same issue.

So, what can iPhone 8 owners do to avoid this issue? The answer is simple: avoid getting the lightning port replaced unless it is absolutely necessary. If your phone is still under warranty, take it to an authorized Apple service center for repairs. If it is out of warranty, consider contacting a reputable repair shop that specializes in iPhone repairs.

If you do need to get the lightning port replaced, make sure you get a genuine Apple part. While aftermarket lightning ports may be cheaper, they are likely to cause more problems in the long run. It is also worth noting that replacing the lightning port yourself can be risky, especially if you are not experienced in iPhone repairs.

In conclusion, the news that lightning port replacement can result in your iPhone 8 being unable to charge is indeed shocking. However, it is a problem that can be avoided with a bit of caution and common sense. If you do need to get your lightning port replaced, make sure you get a genuine Apple part and have it installed by a professional. By taking these precautions, you can ensure that your beloved iPhone 8 stays in good working order for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 iPhone 8 does not recognize headphones or charger but will hold a charge when placed on wireless charger. Headphones and power cord are new and work with other devices. Charge port is not dirty since it is new. The phone does turn on when plugged in, but again, no charge and can’t use headphones.

 You probably purchased a faulty charge port or was this why you changed it to start with? Other than that it could be pry damage on one or more components. I would check under magnification to see if any have been nudged or knocked off.
