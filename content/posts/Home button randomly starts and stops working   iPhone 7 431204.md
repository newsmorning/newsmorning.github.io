Is Your iPhone 7 Possessed? Home Button Mysteriously Turns On and Off!

iPhone users have been reporting a strange issue with their iPhone 7. The home button mysteriously turns on and off, and many users have been left scratching their heads, wondering if their phone has been possessed. The issue has been reported by users across the globe, and it seems to be affecting both old and new iPhones.

The issue is not limited to the iPhone 7, as some users have reported similar issues with earlier models. However, the issue seems to be more prevalent with the iPhone 7. A number of users have taken to social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to report the issue.

The cause of this strange issue is not yet clear, but some users think that it may be related to moisture. Others think it may be a software glitch, while some think it may be a hardware issue. However, the exact cause of the problem is yet to be determined, and Apple has not yet released any official statement on the issue.

So, what can you do if your iPhone 7 has been possessed? Well, the first thing you should do is to check if your phone is still under warranty. If it is, you can take it to an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple Store and have it checked. If the issue is related to hardware, Apple may replace your device for free.

If your iPhone 7 is no longer under warranty, the best thing you can do is to contact Apple Support. They may be able to provide you with a solution, or they may recommend that you take your device to a third-party repair center.

In conclusion, if you are experiencing the strange issue of your iPhone 7 home button mysteriously turning on and off, you are not alone.

## Chosen Solution
 Today after waking up I realised that my home button has stopped randomly working. After a hard reset it started to work again, but after a few minutes stopped again. It sometimes starts to work after a hard reset and sometimes doesn’t work at all. Both the home button and touch ID aren’t responding. I’ve tried resetting it with a stock app too but with no luck. I haven’t tried a factory reset yet.
Another thing to point out is that I have changed the screen but I did it almost two months ago and it worked flawlessly until this point.  Any ideas on how to fix it? Is the problem in the hardware or just a software glitch?

 I would check the connections and clean them. Make sure to unhook the battery before doing any work. If that doesn't help you might try another screen. If that doesn't work you could also try another home button. A different home button will work but touch Id will not work. The home button is paired to the motherboard and the only way to fix that is to take it to apple. If you take it to apple make sure it's backed up. Apple will not guarantee your data. There is a home button available on the screen in settings that will work for most situations.
