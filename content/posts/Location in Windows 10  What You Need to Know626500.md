Introduction

Windows 10 is one of the widely used operating systems in the world. Many people are unaware of the hidden secrets of the location settings that Windows 10 offers, and they can enhance the user experience and privacy.

In this article, we will unveil some of the untold tips and tricks for mastering the location settings of Windows 10.

What are Location Settings?

Location settings in Windows 10 are the settings that allow applications and services to determine and use the device's location data. Location data includes the GPS location, nearby Wi-Fi networks, and cell tower IDs.

These settings are used to provide users with location-aware services such as maps, weather, and location-based search results.

Untold Tips and Tricks

1. Control the applications that use location data

To control which applications can use your location data, go to Settings > Privacy > Location. Here you can toggle on and off the applications that can access your location data.

2. Adjust location accuracy

You can adjust the location accuracy by going to Settings > Privacy > Location > Change Location Settings. Here you can change the default "Best" location accuracy to "Power Saver" or "High Accuracy."

3. Disable location history

Windows 10 keeps track of your location history to improve the accuracy of location-based services. However, if you prefer not to have your location history saved, go to Settings > Privacy > Location > Location History, and toggle off the "Location History" switch.

4. Manage location data by individual app

To manage location data by individual app, go to Settings > Privacy > Location > Choose Apps that can use your precise location. Here you can select or deselect the apps that can access your precise location data.

5. Disable location service altogether

If you don't want any application or service to access your location data, you can disable location service altogether. Go to Settings > Privacy > Location, and toggle off the "Location for this device" switch.

Conclusion

These are some of the untold tips and tricks for mastering the location settings of Windows 10. By following these tricks, you can control which applications can use your location data, adjust location accuracy, and manage location data by individual app. You can also disable location history and location service altogether if you prefer not to have your location data used by any application or service.

With so much importance placed on mobile devices these days, PCs are starting to borrow features from their smaller-screened companions. One such feature in Windows 10 is built-in location services. True, your laptop or desktop doesn't have GPS capability, and many (but not all) lack the ability to communicate with wireless cell towers.

 

Nevertheless, Windows 10 can figure out where you are using Wi-Fi positioning, as well as your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address. The results are pretty accurate.

 
##   Testing Windows 10 Location  
 

If you want to test how well Windows 10 knows where you are, open the built-in Maps app.

 
Instructions in this article apply to Windows 10.
 
- Type Maps in the search box next to the Start button.
 - Select Open on the Maps app.
 - Select Yes if asked to allow Maps to know your precise location.
 - Look for a location marker (a small solid circle inside a bigger circle) on the map where it thinks you're located.
 - If the map doesn't fly to your location, click the location marker on the map's right-hand control panel to try again.

 
##   Does Windows Need to Know Your Location?  
 

Now, when we say Windows 10 "knows" your location, we don't really mean that someone is becoming aware of your present surroundings in real-time. It just means that your PC is storing your current location in a database and will share it with apps that request it — as long as the app is authorized to have it. Windows 10 deletes your location history after 24 hours, but it still may live on in the cloud, stored by other apps and services.

 

Type Maps in the search box next to the Start button.

 

Select Open on the Maps app.

 

Select Yes if asked to allow Maps to know your precise location.

 

Look for a location marker (a small solid circle inside a bigger circle) on the map where it thinks you're located.

 
If the map doesn't fly to your location, click the location marker on the map's right-hand control panel to try again.
 

Location information offers many benefits. It lets you quickly find where you are on a maps app; a weather app can deliver local forecasts based on your location, and apps such as Uber can use it to send a ride to your location.

 

Even though location can come in handy, it's not an absolute necessity for all users, and Microsoft gives you enough control to turn it off. If you do decide to go location-less, keep in mind that you won't be able to use Cortana, which requires your location history to function. The built-in Maps app, meanwhile, doesn't require your location, but without it, Maps can't show your current location to within a few feet.

 
##   Customize Your Location Settings  
 

To make changes to this feature, access Location settings.

 
- Select Start and choose the Settings icon.
 - Select Privacy in the Windows Settings window.
 - Select Location in the left pane under App Permissions.

 
##   Windows 10 Location Controls  
 

There are two basic location controls: one for all users with accounts on your PC and one specifically for your user account.

 

Select Start and choose the Settings icon.

 

Select Privacy in the Windows Settings window.

 

Select Location in the left pane under App Permissions.

 

The setting for all users on your PC is near the top where you see a gray button called Change. It might say Location for this device is on, which means every user can use location services on this PC.

 

Select Change and the toggle switch opens, enabling you to stop every user account on the computer from using location services.

 
##   Allow Apps to Access Your Location on Windows  
 

The next button below Allow Access to Location on This Device is Allow Apps to Access Your Location. This is a per-user setting to turn location services on or off. Using the per-user option is a good idea if one person in your house wants to use location services while others don't.

 

In addition to covering just your basic on/off settings for location, Windows 10 also lets you set location permissions on a per history basis. Scroll down the screen to choose apps that can use your location.

 

Here, you'll see toggles for every app that uses location. If you want to permit Maps to use your location, but don't really see the point of allowing it for Twitter, you can do that.

 
##   Geofencing and Location History in Windows 10  
 

Below the list of apps, you'll also see a paragraph about geofencing. This is a feature that allows an app to monitor your location and then react when you leave a pre-defined area. Cortana, for example, can deliver a reminder such as buying bread when you leave work.

 

There are no geofencing settings: it's part and parcel of the regular location settings. All this area does is let you know if any of your apps are using geofencing. If an app is using the feature, this section says, "One or more of your apps are currently using geofencing."

 

Under Location History, you can erase your location history manually by selecting Clear. If you don't use this setting, your device will erase the location history automatically after 24 hours.

 
##   Windows Location Notifications  
 

The last issue to know about is that Windows 10 will alert you every time an app is using your location. It won't show up as a notification that distracts you. Instead, you'll see the location marker appear on the far right of your taskbar. When that happens an app has used your location.
