Unlock the Secrets of Lost Ark: Discover How to Obtain the Elusive Terpeion for Your Shadow Mounts!

Lost Ark is an exciting action-packed MMORPG that invites players on an epic adventure to explore the mysterious lands of Arkesia. The game features a unique twist where players can customize their mounts with Shadow Mounts. Shadow Mounts are special creatures that players can ride, and they have the ability to support players in battle with their unique skills.

One of the most elusive resources in Lost Ark is the Terpeion, which plays a vital role in upgrading your Shadow Mounts. Terpeion is a rare material that can be challenging to obtain, but with a few tips and tricks, players can unlock the secrets of Lost Ark and discover how to obtain this elusive resource.

To start, players will need to complete the Shadow Mount upgrade quest in the game. This will enable them to have access to Terpeion farming. Players can farm Terpeion by completing Shadow Tower instances. When they defeat the bosses in the instances, they can loot Terpeion as a reward.

Another good way to farm Terpeion is by participating in the PVP arena in Lost Ark. Players can earn Terpeion by winning battles against other players. There is also a chance for players to earn Terpeion by participating in rare events that are organized by the game developers.

Apart from farming Terpeion, players can also purchase the resource from the marketplace. However, it's important to note that Terpeion can be costly, so players need to be wise when using their in-game currency.

When players have enough Terpeion, they can use it to upgrade their Shadow Mounts to the next level. They can do this by accessing the Shadow Mount upgrade window located in their inventory.

In conclusion, Terpeion is an essential resource that can help players upgrade their Shadow Mounts in Lost Ark. By farming, participating in PVP events, or purchasing from the marketplace, players can obtain Terpeion and unlock the secrets of Lost Ark. Remember, upgrading your Shadow Mounts with Terpeion will give you an advantage in battle and make your journey through Arkesia more enjoyable.


Mounts are pretty important in Lost Ark – they help you navigate the world faster, while also looking very cool. There are multiple other mounts such as the Cerberus, Ladybug etc. But let’s take a look at how to get the Pegasus Mount (Terpeion/Terpeion of the Shadow) in Lost Ark.
 
## How to Get Pegasus Mount in Lost Ark (Terpeion/Terpeion of the Shadow)?
 
Players can unlock the Pegasus mount in Lost Ark for free by logging in the game between February 19 at 11:59AM PT (February 20, 7:59AM UTC) through March 1 at 11:59PM PT (March 2 at 7:59PM UTC). That’s because the Terpeion/Terpeion of the Shadow mount is a reward that is part of the Launch Celebration gift (which also has a few more freebies included). So, make sure you log in during this time period and check your Product inventory to claim this famous horse as a Mount.
 

 
As you know, the Pegasus is a mythical horse with wings but Terpeion or Terpeion of the Shadow does not fly in Lost Ark. The Hoverboard Mount will help you glide and traverse the maps, though, so you can unlock it if you like.
 
Unfortunately, for many players, especially in the EU, the launch celebration gift is not showing up. In this situation, you can try closing Steam, restarting it and loading up the game to see if it’s available for you. If that does not work, then all we can do is wait until the developers fix the bug.
 
Remember that mounts are account bound so you can use it for any and all Alt characters that you create within the same account. Speaking of alts, we’ve got a guide related to alts on Gamer Tweak where you will find out why you need to have them in Lost Ark.
