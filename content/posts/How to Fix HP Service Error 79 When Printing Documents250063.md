Note: If you are using a power surge protector, first remove it, then plug back the printer directly to the wall socket, before turning on the power again.
 
If the Error 79 message persists on your printer’s display, disconnect any network or USB cables, as well as the power cycle. 
 
If the printer goes back to Ready status, check its firmware version, then update the firmware in case a newer version is available.
 
In order to find your printer’s firmware version, print a Configuration Report from the printer’s control panel, or you can also visit the HP Support page to check for the latest firmware version available.
 
In case the error 79 issue recurs on your printer, try and isolate it to something that could be in your own environment. 
 
Delete any print jobs from your computer, or any other computers connected to the printer, then perform a test print job.
 
### 2. Reinstall the DIMM
 
2.1 Remove and install the DIMM again
 
- Turn off the printer.
 - Next, remove the DIMM.
 - Reinstall the DIMM to confirm that it sits properly in the printer.
 - Turn on the HP printer.

 
2.2 Remove or replace the DIMM
 
- Remove any installed DIMMS
 - Perform a retest on your HP printer
 - If the print work is fine, install a DIMM that is supported by your printer

 
### 3. Reinstall the drivers
 
- In the Windows Search bar, type Control and open Control Panel.
 - Choose Uninstall a program and remove all HP printer-related software.
 - Right-click Start and open Device Manager.
 - Under the Print queues, remove the HP device by uninstalling it.
 - Restart your PC and wait until the driver is installed automatically.
 - Install the HP associated software again and, hopefully, that should be enough to fix the problem.

 
Another viable step is to completely remove the printer device from your PC and reinstall it again. This approach requires you to uninstall both drivers and HP associated software and that shouldn’t be hard.
 
You can also give a try to a specialized third-party tool that will scan your PC for any missing our outdated drivers and update them.
