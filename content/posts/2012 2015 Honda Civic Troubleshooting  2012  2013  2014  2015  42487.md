If you notice that the warning lights on your dashboard are illuminated, this is likely an indication that something is wrong with your car. The check engine light, ABS light, and battery light are the most common warning lights to come on in a Honda Civic. These warning lights can indicate anything from a loose gas cap to a faulty battery.

Solution: Take your car to a qualified mechanic or Honda service center to diagnose the problem. The mechanic can examine your car under the hood to identify the source of the noise.

Problem 3: Unresponsive Steering or Suspension

If you feel that your Honda Civic's steering is unresponsive or there is a clunking noise when driving over bumps, this is likely a sign of suspension issues. With time, Civic suspension joints wear out, leading to poor handling and poor performance.

Solution: Take your car to a trusted mechanic or Honda service center to have the suspension system diagnosed. The mechanic can replace any worn parts to restore your car's handling and performance.
