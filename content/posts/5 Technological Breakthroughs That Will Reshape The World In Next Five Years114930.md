# Revolutionizing the Future: Discover the 5 Groundbreaking Technologies That Will Change Your Life Forever in Just 5 Years!

In the past, technological progress has always been slow and steady. But with the rapid acceleration of innovation, we are now moving into a world where the impossible is becoming possible. In just five years, we will see five groundbreaking technologies that will change our lives forever. These technologies may seem like something out of a sci-fi movie, but they are rapidly becoming a reality. Here are five technologies that will have a significant impact on our future.

## 1. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

Brain-Computer Interfaces represent a symbiotic relationship between the human brain and machines. These interfaces will allow us to control devices, appliances, and even robots with our thoughts. In just a few years, BCIs will unlock new levels of digital experiences and introduce new ways to interact with technology.

Imagine being able to control your computer or smartphone just by thinking about it. With BCIs, this will soon become a reality. We will be able to type emails, browse the web, and control smart homes without ever touching a device. And the applications of this technology are endless, from helping individuals with disabilities to enhancing gaming experiences.

## 2. Autonomous Vehicles

Self-driving cars have been on the horizon for a long time, and in just five years, they will become a common sight on our roads. With the help of innovative technologies such as LiDAR, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles will revolutionize the way we commute.

Self-driving cars will help reduce traffic congestion, cut down on accidents, and create new jobs. And for the first time, people will have the freedom to travel without the need for a driver's license.

## 3. Virtual Reality (VR)

Virtual Reality has evolved from a technology for gaming and entertainment to a powerful tool for education, training, and therapy. In the next five years, the technology will become more accessible, affordable and will offer more immersive experiences.

VR will transform the way we learn, travel, and experience events. For instance, classrooms will no longer be limited by geography, and events such as concerts and sports games can be experienced from the comfort of our homes. The technology also has applications in mental health, where it is used to treat conditions such as phobias and PTSD.

## 4. 5G Technology

As our world becomes more connected, the need for faster and more robust networks is more critical than ever. 5G technology offers a significant leap in mobile network technology, with several times faster speeds than the current 4G technology.

5G will enable new applications such as holographic telepresence, remote surgery, IoT, and autonomous vehicles. The technology offers speeds that could surpass the capacity of fiber-optic lines, making internet connectivity more accessible in remote areas.

## 5. Quantum Computing

Quantum computing may sound like something from a sci-fi movie, but it represents the future of computing. In just five years, quantum computers will revolutionize the way we process information, solve complex problems and usher in a new era of computing.

Quantum computing will have significant applications in areas such as cryptography, drug development, stock market trading, and weather forecasting, among others. The technology will also enable the development of smarter AI, opening up new possibilities in areas such as self-driving cars, robotics, and automation.

In conclusion, these groundbreaking technologies will have a significant impact on our future. As they become more accessible and affordable, they will create new jobs, change the way we live, and transform industries. By embracing these technologies, we can unlock new opportunities and take humanity to bold new heights.

IBM predicted that in the coming 5 years, technologies based on Artificial Intelligence, Crypto Anchors and Computers built through Blockchain Technology, will pave way for new solutions. These will help tackle issues such as food safety, authenticity of manufactured components, genetically modified products, identification of counterfeit objects and provenance of luxury goods.
 
From World’s tiniest computer smaller than grain of salt to AI powered microscopes, here’s a list of technological advancements that will impact the lives for the next 5 years.
 
### 1. IBM designed product –

World’s smallest computer that will cost less than 10 cents to manufacture will be able to monitor, communicate, analyze and act on data. This product will be designed with the help of Blockchain technology and cryptographic anchors, which will be embedded into everyday devices. “They’ll be used in tandem with blockchain distributed ledger technology to ensure an object’s authenticity from its point of origin to when it reaches the hands of the customer.”, said Arvind Krishna, Head of IBM Research.
 
### 2. AI powered Robot Microscopes-

Networked in the cloud and deployed worldwide, these robotic microscopes are robust enough to constantly monitor the health of oceans around the globe. AI powered robots are used to figure out if the water bodies are healthy, and can also monitor the extent of water pollution in large bodies. Tech Giant, Krishna, highlighted how different types of technologies are coming together, particularly with AI, to solve unexpected environmental problems.
 
### 3. Use of Crypto Anchors to fight Counterfeiting –

What crypto anchors basically do is that they embed tiny codes, like QR codes in a way that it can authenticate a product’s origin till it reaches the customers. And if any kind of tampering is done, crypto-anchors will help crack-down counterfeiting as well as ensure security in the food supply chain. With global losses worth $600 billion a year through fraud and counterfeiting, crypto anchors will ensure everything from food, to diamonds, to life saving medicines.
 
### 4. Lattice Cryptography-

As more and more sensitive data is being collected and stored online, security measures for the same are needed to keep pace with growing capability of hackers. As powerful computing devices become cheaper and more available, Lattices can be used that will hide sensitive data inside in a complex algebraic structure. Lattice cryptography can constantly fight with hackers and through encrypted codes it will ensure that bad guys can’t touch your personal data.
 
### 5. Explosion in biased AI –

Most of the AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on, and if that data has been collected in a negotiable way, then the outcomes are unlikely to fit with the real world & they can become a reason of some unbiased results and decisions. New innovations would be made into AI systems that would hopefully be able to make decisions with less bias, but the challenge is that Artificial Intelligence gets trained on data so it becomes very quintessential to train AI systems with no bias and if that data has a bias then your AI will be biased.
 
These above mentioned technological breakthroughs certainly sound enticing and since they’re backed by IBM, we can certainly take their word. Nonetheless, there’s still some time before they’re introduced and we can only but wait before these marvellous technologies can actually make a mark.
