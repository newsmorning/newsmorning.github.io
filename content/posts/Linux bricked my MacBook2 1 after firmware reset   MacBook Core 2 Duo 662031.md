If you're a MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo user who's been eyeing the Linux operating system as a viable replacement for macOS, you might need to think twice before making the switch. According to a recent report, attempting to reset the firmware on a MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo with Linux can result in catastrophic damage to the device.

The report comes as a shock to both MacBook and Linux enthusiasts who have long regarded the combination as a seamless match. But now, it appears that the seemingly innocuous act of resetting firmware can have dire consequences, leaving MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo users with bricked devices.

So, what exactly is going on? Why is resetting firmware on a MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo with Linux such a problem?

Here's what we know so far.

## How the incident happened

The incident that led to this discovery happened when a MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo user attempted to reset the device's firmware using the Flashrom utility while running the latest version of Linux.

While the user expected the process to go smoothly, they were met with an error message that read, "FATAL! Unsupported flash chip."

At this point, the MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo wouldn't turn on anymore, and standard troubleshooting methods proved unsuccessful in reviving it. The MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo was, for all intents and purposes, bricked. This isn't the first instance of firmware-related issues occurring with a 2015 MacBook Pro.

## Why firmware resetting is irreversible

The MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo's firmware is the software that controls the device's hardware, acting as its primary operating system. When resetting the firmware, it's almost like reinstalling the system's most basic instructions for the device. If something goes wrong during the process, it can cause major issues, including rendering the device unusable.

The fact that MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo firmware resetting is irreversible exacerbates the problem. If something goes wrong during the process, it can permanently damage your device.

## What to do if your MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo is bricked

If you've tried resetting your MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo's firmware and faced similar issues, you have a few options. Unfortunately, you might need to spend some money to resolve the issue.

You could take your device to an Apple Store or authorized repair center and seek assistance. However, Apple isn't obligated to repair bricked MacBooks that have been tampered with, so you may have to cough up a hefty repair fee.

Alternatively, you could try seeking a third-party repair service that might be more affordable. However, you run the risk of voiding your device's warranty if you opt for a third-party fix.

## The verdict

So, is Linux firmware resetting the end of the MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo?

Not necessarily. While moving away from macOS to Linux on a MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo used to be a popular option, the risks of rendering your device unusable might not be worth it. While some users might be able to successfully and safely reset their firmware, others might not be as lucky.

The MacBook2 1 Core 2 Duo might not be the latest MacBook iteration, nor is it necessarily the most powerful, but it's still a valuable device for many users. If you're one of these people, consider whether risking a bricked MacBook is worth the potential rewards of running Linux.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I just reset my firmware (Alt+Cmd+R+P) hoping my new battery will get calibrated.
After the reset, the MacBook automatically started into Linux (debian jessie).
But instead I wanted to boot into Mac OS X Lion. So I rebooted.
But it never rebooted anymore. When I start the MacBook, the screen remains black, blank and dark. The LED keeps shining. There is no start sound anymore. It's gone.
I tried to restore the firmware using the Firmware Restoration CD.
But instead of blinking 3x fast, 3x slow, 3x fast, the LED blinks like several times really fast, when I hold down the Power-button.
I'm afraid, debian bricked my MacBook's firmware because it thought this was empty, free memory, right after the reset.
What can I do now? The Hardware is totally ok, but now the firmware is completely gone. How do I completely restore it? (I don't mind opening this thing, as I opened it a thousand times, to change the logic-board, CD-drive, keyboard  â€¦)

 First off, Command + Option (or Alt) + P + R doesn't "reset the firmware". It's actually the modern Intel Mac equivalent of the old "Zap The PRAM" (Zapping the NVRAM in this case) troubleshooting step, that was often recommended and used during the old PowerPC Mac days. More info on it from Apple is here: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204063
First, what I would try doing is to try booting your Mac from an alternate startup disk, such as your Mac OS X install disk/MacBook software disk, or an external hard drive, to verify that the issue isn't limited to your main startup volume.
Second - immediately, your symptoms as described suggest either potentially bad RAM, or a bad RAM slot. First, try reseating your RAM before powering up. Failing that, try testing each of the two individual slots of RAM with a piece of known good RAM.

 Have you tried swapping out the hard drive between this Mac and your other MacBook (which I assume is another A1181 with OS X installed)? Did you try booting your Mac from an OS X install CD/DVD? From what you've said so far, you've only tried booting your MacBook from its original hard drive and OS.
Before doing anything rash, or drastic, it's helpful to at least try to isolate other variables (e.g. the OS on your boot disk) before going further.
At least what you can try is to just remove the hard drive. If, on boot, the display lights up and shows the blinking "?" folder icon, at least that tells you that the Mac's hardware is booting up the way it should.
Another alternative would be to try booting from a rEFIt Boot CD. If successful, you could try to install rEFIt (an older boot manager for OS X/Linux//Windows) to your main hard disk to get your system back.
At this point the only other thing I can think of would be to try using the ASD disk to at least diagnose the problem on your Mac. The thing is, there are two types of MacBook 2,1 (the Mid-2007 and the Late-2007), so depending on your Mac's date of origin it'll need either ASD 3S116 or ASD 3S123. (The former can be burned to a CD, while the latter must be installed to an external hard drive.)

 Asking here is already the third step! I already tried booting - the MacBook does not do any attempt to boot at all. Neither Alt, nor C, nor anything works, as I guess this all have been firmware functions.
And of course I swaped the RAM. The former RAM is perfectly working in my not so nice looking backup-MacBook, I recently saved from the dump.
There even is no start-sound. After resetting the PRAM / NVRAM / w/e RAM with this stupid combination ALT+CMD+P+R, the MacBook booted perfectly exactly ONE TIME! Into Linux! Which must have wiped out the firmware - that is the only explaination I see.
After the reboot(! ... I didn't even turn off and on the computer), nothing worked anymore.
That is why I ask for help restoring the firmware even by opening and flashing the firmware w/e chip by hand, violently, in any Apple-unsupported method necessary.

 The Hard-disk already is pulled out (I just built it into the replacement-MacBook, in which it works fine).
And yes, also the memory is replaced (the 2x2GB now work fine in my replacement-MacBook, while I put the former working 2x1GB-RAM into the broken one).
Still the screen (as well as an external monitor) remains black and the LED stays bright.
There is no way to boot any CD or DVD or USB-drive, booting is not possible anymore. I cannot even get the CD out of the Optical Drive.
The thing that makes me wonder the most is that - if it'd work or not - the LED blinks like 10x fast, when I try to use the Firmware-Restoration-CD (holding down the Power-Button, until the LED should blink 3x fast, 3x slow, 3x fast).

 Did you find a solution?

 just happened to me as well, in similar circumstances - too ancient hardware to worth any more time but if anybody has a solution I'd love to hear it
