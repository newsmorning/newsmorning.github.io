As we go about our daily internet activities, we often forget that our browsing history is being tracked and recorded.

This is unlike Internet Explorer, which offers a direct option to prevent users from deleting cookies and browser history.
 
Nevertheless, there are few options (hacks & tweaks) that have been tried in the past.
 
2. Using Google Apps Admin Console
 
- Under Google’s C-Panel (Google Apps Admin Console), navigate to Device Management.
 - Under Device Management, go to Chrome Management.
 - Select User Settings and navigate to Security.
 - Under the Incognito Mode drop-down menu, select Disallow Incognito Mode.
 - Scroll down to the Browser History drop-down option and select Always save browser history.

 
This is relatively a rudimentary method, and any user with mid-level tech know-how would easily bypass it and clear the browser history. Nevertheless, you can also try the method below.
 
3. Blacklist History Frame& Clear Browser Data Frame
 
Note: This is also a function of Google Apps Admin Console
 
- Under C-Panel, click on Device Management.
 - Select Chrome Management, then navigate to User Setting.
 - Locate URL Blacklist, under URL Blocking.
 - In the URL Blacklist boxes, enter the following chrome://settings/clearBrowserData/ chrome://settings-frame/clearBrowserData chrome://history-frame/ chrome://history/
 - Save the changes made.

 
This method has been proven to work on old Chrome versions, and it’s also more effective than trying to disable the delete browsing history option in Chrome with Registry. 
 
With newer versions, however, users are easily able to work around it and successfully clear history. Moreover, it only works to disable the delete browsing history option on a Chromebook.
 
4. Use Google History Extension
 
- Get the Full History Keeper extension and click Add to Chrome to install it.
 - Link it to your Chrome account and start saving up your history.

 
This records all sites visited via Chrome and you’ll be able to access browsing history, even after the user has cleared it.
 
Note: Setting Chrome to Incognito mode effectively renders this method useless. Also, if a user logs out of the Chrome account, he/she can easily clear his/her browser history, without leaving any trace.
 
Lastly, you can easily block any inappropriate site on your Chrome browser, especially with the use of OpenDNS (and a host of other tools). With this, no user will be able to access the blacklisted site(s) via Chrome on your PC.
 
### Prevent users from deleting browsing history in Edge
 
1. Disable Clear Browsing Data on Exit on Edge
 
- Launch Microsoft Edge then click on the three dots menu, followed by Settings.
 - Next, type delete in the search bar and select the Choose what to clear every time you close the browser option.
 - Uncheck the Browsing history tickbox.
 - Exit Microsoft Edge afterward.

 
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge, as emphasized above, do not provide clearly-defined options to prevent users from deleting cookies and browser history.
 
There are, however, various forms of hacks and tweaks, which, if properly implemented, would restrict or outrightly prevent third-party users from deleting browser history.
 
Some of these tweaks and hacks range from extending browser history expiration period to disabling default clearing of browser history on exit.
 
Bottom line, there is no clear-cut method for disabling delete browsing history on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. The only browser that supports this function is Internet Explorer.
 
Hence, if you want to have unfettered access to your kids’ or employees’ browsing history, Internet Explorer is the ideal browser for you.
 
### Does clearing history delete everything?
 
Your browser history is not simply a record of all of the websites that you have ever visited. Rather, it is much more than that. This history also includes cached files and cookies, as well as information about previous searches, autofill data, and other information. 
 
If you want to delete everything, you will have to specifically select all the data and the time range when deleting your data.
 
It is only natural that you should sometimes erase your browsing history, as it ultimately contributes to a comprehensive and personal trace of your actions on the Internet.
 
However, wiping the history of your online activity from inside your web browser or operating system will not make the information completely vanish. In point of fact, these methods will simply remove references to your files.
 
We recommend that you take a look at our guide on what to do in case your browser won’t delete your data.
