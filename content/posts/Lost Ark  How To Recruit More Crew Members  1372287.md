# Discover the Ultimate Secrets to Build the Ultimate Crew in Lost Ark!

Lost Ark is a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) that has been gaining popularity due to its unique gameplay and engaging storyline. The game puts players in a world filled with danger, where they must embark on dangerous quests to uncover the ultimate secrets of the game's story.

One of the key elements of Lost Ark is building a strong crew that can support you throughout your journey. Knowing how to build the ultimate crew is essential if you want to progress through the game efficiently.

In this article, we'll provide you with some of the ultimate secrets to build the ultimate crew in Lost Ark. 

## 1. Class Combinations 

Lost Ark has 14 different classes that players can choose from at the start of the game. Each class has its strengths, weaknesses, and unique move sets. When building a crew, it is crucial to select classes that complement each other.

For example, classes such as the Berserker or Warrior make excellent front-line fighters who can take a lot of damage. A Summoner or Bard, on the other hand, will do better in the support role, healing and buffing your team.

2. Communication

Communication is critical when building a crew in Lost Ark. It is essential to establish good communication channels right from the start. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to goals, quests, and strategies.

Effective communication also ensures that everyone knows their role within the team. Make use of available communication tools, such as in-game chat, to communicate your needs and make plans accordingly.

3. Crafting and Gathering 

Crafting and gathering are two critical aspects of Lost Ark that can help to enhance your crew's strength. For example, gathering materials can help you to create powerful weapons and armor that will provide essential buffs to your team.

Make sure you assign one or two members of your crew to specialize in gathering materials, while others focus on crafting items. The crafting and gathering system can be complex, so it's essential to communicate and work together to achieve the desired results.

4. Clans and Alliances

Clans and alliances are groups of players who come together to achieve common goals. Joining a clan or an alliance can be beneficial, particularly when your crew is still in its early stages of development.

Joining an alliance or clan can give you access to new quests, dungeons, and other resources that can help your crew to become stronger. 

5. Experience

Experience points are essential in Lost Ark, as they help you level up and unlock new skills and abilities. Make sure that you're focusing on the right quests and dungeons that will give you the most experience points.

In conclusion, building the ultimate crew in Lost Ark requires careful planning, effective communication, and teamwork. Be sure to utilize the class combinations, communication channels, crafting and gathering system, and clans and alliances to build the strongest team. With these tips, you'll be able to discover the ultimate secrets in Lost Ark and build the ultimate crew. Good luck, and have fun exploring the Lost Ark's world!

The crew is an integral and the most crucial factor whilst sailing in Lost Ark. The speed of your ship depends on your crew. It is up to you to recruit and add new sailors to the crew. These sailors have different skills based on their diverse rarities. You can send your crew to complete your different activities like dungeons, raids, daily missions, and other naval missions from your Stronghold. But for that, you will need additional sailors of higher rarities. Here’s our guide on how to recruit and get more crew sailors in Lost Ark.
 
## How to Recruit & Get More Crew Sailors in Lost Ark?
 
Before we start with getting more crew members, there are some prerequisites you will have to complete. You have to complete all the story quests of Luttera and then unlock your first boat. After getting your first boat, you have to activate the Sailor Contract in your inventory. This will allow you to recruit and add more sailors to your crew. This also depends on the size of your boat or ship.
 

 
- Now, one of the ways to recruit Sailors to your crew is to find a Trade Merchant.
 - You will have to purchase a contract through research at the lab to allow them in your Stronghold.
 - These merchants sell collectibles, rare items, and add new sailors to your crew in exchange for Seals.
 - They are available temporarily in your Stronghold and their items keep on changing as the game server resets.
 - Although they provide you with new crew members, their rarities are most often low and do not offer any skills.
 - But as the server approximately resets every eight hours, there is also a chance that you might get a hold of Sailors with high rarity and skills.
 - Alternatively, the other way to get more crew members is through Mokoko seeds.
 - These seeds are collectible currencies that are scattered all around and easily obtainable.
 - You can then redeem the crew application form to add a new crew member by spending these seeds.
 - With these seeds, you can get crew members like Cocorico, Narinari, Poipoi, and Chicachica.

 
Make a note that there are certain sailors that you can use only in ships while some can be used only in your Stronghold.
