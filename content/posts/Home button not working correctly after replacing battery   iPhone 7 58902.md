WARNING: Is your iPhone 7 DYING? Home button malfunctioning after battery replacement could mean the end for your device!

As an iPhone 7 user, you know how important the home button is. It’s the key to unlocking and using your phone. But what happens when your home button malfunctions? Especially after battery replacement? It could mean the end for your device.

The home button is a feature unique to Apple smartphones that serves as a physical button on the front of the phone, allowing you to return to the home screen, activate Siri or use Apple Pay. When it malfunctions, you lose access to these essential functions, and that makes your phone feel almost unusable.

Apple’s latest iPhone 7 iteration was created with a solid-state home button that doesn’t physically click like previous versions. It relies on haptic feedback to simulate the feeling of a click. Ironically, this new and improved design is also what makes the home button more susceptible to malfunctioning.

Battery replacement is a regular occurrence as phone users demand longer lasting batteries. But, when the iPhone 7’s home button is affected after battery replacement, it may be ruined for good.

While it can be easy to find any local repair shop to replace your smartphone battery, it is essential that you get the proper service for your iPhone 7 to avoid ruining the home button functionality. Amateur repair services and replacement battery may cause irreparable damage to your device, which may render it permanently unusable.

Apple recommends that all iPhone 7 battery replacements should only be done through an authorized Apple service provider, with genuine Apple parts. It helps avoid malfunctions, like the home button not responding, screen brightness reduction, or the device appearing dead. When the home button fails, your iPhone 7 will become completely unusable, and you may need to replace it.

In conclusion, as an iPhone 7 user, it is vital that you take the necessary precautions when getting your battery replaced. Always ensure that the service provider is authorized and using genuine Apple parts to prevent damage to your device, such as malfunctioning home button harm. A malfunctioning home button can be expensive to repair or even irreparable, so it’s better to be safe than sorry.

## Chosen Solution
 After I replaced my battery my home button is acting very strange. Touch ID is fine, but the click is very strange now and then. Sometimes it works perfectly fine and other times its freaking out. When I hold it for example it keeps clicking, when it’s supposed to click just once. Does anyone have an idea how to solve it?

I’ve already tried to loosen the screws, checked the cable for tears, none visable. Hard reset doesn’t work either..
Thanks in advance.

 Hi Robin, sorry to hear replacing didn’t solve it for you. But don’t give up yet, there are more options. Sometimes it takes a while to find the thing that isn’t working right.
I read that a software reset might help. That’s an easy one to try.
If that doesn’t work check out iPhone 7 home button not working after screen replacement @rany.
Rany put together a extensive list of known facts and number 6 seems like a possibility for your problem.
FACT 6: in some instances, a chip (other than the one in FACT 1) present on the home button is damaged (specially during transfer of home button from broken to new screen). When damaged and failing, this chip will prevent home button function from working such as to exit an app and go back to home screen. But the finger print scanner would still be working and you are able to wake/unlock the screen with your finger/fingerprint and use reachability. This chip is accessible (contrary to the fingerprint scanner chip in FACT 1 which is practically unreachable) can be replaced and the issue can be fixed. Sometimes a partial tear to the home button cable can cause the same failure. It is also repairable by some people with the right tools, skill, and patient mindset.
