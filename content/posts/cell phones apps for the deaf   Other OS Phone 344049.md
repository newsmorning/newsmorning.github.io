Title: You Won't Believe the Life-Changing Cell Phone Apps for the Deaf on Non-iPhone Devices!

Introduction:
The world we live in today is interconnected through technology, and cell phones have become an important tool for communication. For people with hearing disabilities, cell phone apps have the potential to change their lives. While iPhone users enjoy various apps for the deaf community, there are also many apps available on android devices that are often overlooked. 

The purpose of this article is to highlight some of these life-changing apps that people with hearing disabilities can use on their non-iPhone devices. From captioning phone calls and videos to translating spoken words into text, these apps help deaf individuals to communicate more efficiently and effectively.

Apps for Captioning Phone Calls:
One of the most challenging obstacles faced by people with hearing disabilities is phone conversations. Captioning phone calls have revolutionized the way hearing-impaired individuals can communicate over the phone. For non-iPhone users, there are apps such as Hamilton CapTel and CaptionCall that work on Android devices.

Captioning Apps for Videos:
Videos have become a significant source of information and entertainment in today's world. However, they can be challenging for the hearing-impaired. Fortunately, there are apps such as Clipsync, which automatically caption any video played on a mobile device, making it more accessible to the deaf. The app uses speech recognition to generate captions, making it easier for people with hearing disabilities to consume video content effortlessly.

Apps for Translating Spoken Words into Text:
Another common problem for the deaf community is understanding what someone is saying. Fortunately, there are apps such as Live Transcribe and Ava, which translate spoken words into text. These apps use the microphone in the mobile device to convert speech into text, making it easier for individuals with hearing loss to communicate with hearing people in real-time.

Apps for Learning Sign Language:
For individuals with hearing disabilities, communicating through sign language is essential. However, it can be challenging to find resources to learn and practice sign language. Thankfully, there are apps such as SignSchool, which teaches sign language through interactive lessons and games. The app covers various topics, including basic signs, numbers, and even job-specific signs to assist with employment. 

Conclusion:
In summary, cell phone apps offer a vast array of resources to empower the deaf community by providing access to an inclusive world. The apps mentioned in this article offer a glimpse into that world and how technology can be a game-changer for people with hearing disabilities. As non-iPhone devices continue to develop, the potential for more life-changing apps for the deaf community can only grow, ensuring communication accessibility for everyone, everywhere.

## Chosen Solution
 Part 1   I am interested in knowing about how cell phones work.  Do they receive actual voices through the antenna  OR do they receive an electronic signal which is translated into  a voice.
Part 2 In a cell phone which has an app downloaded to show a deaf person the words of the caller, does the same apply? Actual words received by the cell phone or just an electronic signal ?

 Hi @ramses2 ,
The phones use analogue to digital converters ADC - DAC to convert analogue voice signals into digital signals which are transmitted to the distant end where they are converted back again to analogue signals so that they can be understood by the human ear.
Donâ€™t know about the app whether it converts the digital signal (not when it is first received by the phone as it has to be translated back down from the digital transmission frequency signal before it is converted to analogue) to text or if it converts the analogue signal, but would suspect that it may be the digital signal.

 Long story short for part 1 of your queries:
http://web.mit.edu/6.02/www/s2012/handou...
See section 14.1.1
To directly answer your question about "voices directly through the antenna" the answer is no.  Though no expert on information related to section 2 of your query, basically the sequence of events is related to receiving the signal via the antenna, processing the received signal via demodulation, converted into digital format that your computer can process, and then converts that digital information into a format that humans can decipher via various forms of software interfaces (one of which is the software interface that will display text format to a hearing impaired user or a video that utilizes sub-title format to display necessary language translation). This very basic attempt of mine to explain the key concepts involved in the processes you are enquiring about barely scratches the surface (to put it mildly) of the information needed to understand the whole process.  :-)
