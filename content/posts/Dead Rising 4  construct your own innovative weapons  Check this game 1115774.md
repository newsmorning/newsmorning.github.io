# Out Now! Create the Ultimate Zombie Apocalypse Arsenal in Dead Rising 4 - You Won't Believe How Insane Your Weapons Can Get!

Are you ready for a wild ride through a zombie-infested world? Look no further than Dead Rising 4, the latest addition to the popular video game series. With its vast array of weapons, the game lets you create all sorts of crazy contraptions that will leave the undead trembling in fear. In this article, we'll give you a taste of what's in store so you can start planning your ultimate zombie apocalypse arsenal.

## Choose Your Weapon - the Basics

Before we dive into the crazier weapons, let's start with the basics. Dead Rising 4 features a wide variety of melee weapons to suit every taste, from baseball bats and crowbars to machetes and sledgehammers. You can also find firearms such as pistols, shotguns, and assault rifles to deal with the more dangerous specimens.

But the real fun comes when you start mixing and matching. Combine a baseball bat with nails to create a vicious spiked bat, or add a chainsaw to a broom handle for a makeshift polearm. And why stop at one weapon when you can wield two at once, such as a grenade launcher and a chainsaw, to really spice things up?

## Outrageous Weapons - the sky's the limit

Now that you've got the hang of things, it's time to push the boundaries of sanity. Dead Rising 4 offers some truly outrageous weapons that are sure to make a splash (or more likely, a spray of blood).

One of the most iconic weapons is the combination chainsaw and motorcycle, which lets you mow down the undead at high speed. If that's not your speed, try the electric rake, which gives new meaning to the phrase "shocking experience." Or how about the acid raincoat, a rain slicker filled with acidic liquid that melts anything it touches?

But perhaps the most infamous weapon in Dead Rising 4 is the exo-suit. This suit gives you superhuman strength and durability, allowing you to bash through crowds of zombies with ease. And if that's not enough, you can equip it with all sorts of built-in weapons, such as flamethrowers, rocket launchers, and even a giant fist that smashes everything in its path.

## Conclusion

Dead Rising 4 is a treasure trove of weapons and wacky inventions that will keep you entertained for hours. Whether you prefer classic melee weapons or outrageous contraptions, there's something for everyone in this game. So grab your controller, unleash your inner mad scientist, and let the zombie apocalypse begin!

Dead Rising 4 is the (you guessed it) fourth installment in the Dead Rising game series where the principle of the game is to construct your own innovative weapons  you can use against an army of undead. The game has gained popularity due to its original concept where players use preposterous means of combining different objects like a paddle and a chainsaw with something like duct tape.

According to the announced details, Dead Rising 4 should be available sometime next month. Xbox One players that are barely able to wait for the game to drop can find a little comfort in the fact that Microsoft has made it available for pre-load. Pre-load is a feature available for those that have pre-ordered the game, regardless of which version they have selected. Unfortunately, pre-load isn’t available for the PC version. Pre-loading allows users to prepare the game ahead of its release, so when it finally releases, all they have to do is play it. The files for Dead Rising 4 amount to a total of 36.34 GB, making it bigger than the last installment in the series by a full 10 GB.
 
Dead Rising 4 was confirmed to not be part of Microsoft’s Play Anywhere project. Play Anywhere was introduced by Microsoft as a means for players that own both a PC computer operating with Windows 10 and an Xbox One transition from one platform to the other with save files for a game updated on both devices as they progress. Also, players that buy the game on one platform will not be required to buy it on the other platform. Windows 10 is a critical requirement for this service. Unfortunately for Dead Rising fans that own both devices, they will have to invest their time wisely and prioritize a platform.
