One such tool that is widely used in the hacking community is Nmap. It is an open-source tool that is used for network exploration, management, and security auditing. With the help of Nmap, you can identify hosts and services on a computer network, create a map of the network, and much more.

In this guide, we will explore Nmap and its various features to help you master the basics and revolutionize your hacking skills.

## What is Nmap?

As mentioned above, Nmap is an open-source tool used for network exploration, management, and security auditing. It is one of the most powerful and versatile network scanners available in the market today. It can be used to identify hosts and services on a computer network, create a map of the network, and much more.

There are several reasons why Nmap is a must-have tool for any hacker or security professional:

- It is free and open-source
- It is cross-platform and runs on all major operating systems
- It has a vast range of features which are constantly updated
- It is very fast and efficient

Now that we know what Nmap is let us dive into its various features and learn how we can use the tool to take our hacking skills to the next level.

## Scanning with Nmap

Scanning is one of the fundamental tasks of network exploration, and Nmap is designed to do just that. Nmap can scan entire networks, identify hosts, services, and even vulnerabilities. Here's how you can perform a basic scan with Nmap:

```
nmap <Target IP Address>
```

In this command, `<Target IP Address>` is the IP address of the target network. This command will send a series of packets to the target IP address and report back on the open ports, operating system, and other details.

You can even perform a more thorough scan using various Nmap flags. Here are some of the most commonly used flags:

- `-T4`: Specifies the timing template (T4 is the default)
- `-sS`: Performs a SYN scan
- `-F`: Scans only the most common ports
- `-O`: Attempts to identify the operating system running on the target

Here's an example of a more thorough scan:

```
nmap -sS -T4 -F -O <Target IP Address>
```

This command will perform a SYN scan, use the T4 timing template, only scan the most common ports, and attempt to identify the operating system running on the target.

## Nmap Scripts

Nmap also has a vast range of scripts that can be used for vulnerability detection, service discovery, and much more. These scripts are written in Lua and can be easily executed from within Nmap with the `-sC` flag.

Here's an example of how you can use Nmap scripts:

```
nmap -sS -T4 -sC <Target IP Address>
```

This command will perform a SYN scan using the T4 timing template and execute all the default scripts provided with Nmap. You can also specify the specific script you want to execute using the `--script` flag.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we explored the various features of Nmap and learned how we can use the tool to revolutionize our hacking skills. Nmap is a versatile and powerful tool used by security professionals and hackers worldwide. With the help of Nmap, you can identify hosts and services on a computer network, create a map of the network, and much more.

Mastering Nmap is just the beginning of your journey in the world of hacking, but it is one of the most crucial skills you need to have in today's technological landscape. So what are you waiting for? Start exploring Nmap today and gain the upper hand in the world of hacking.

## What is Nmap?
 
Nmap (or “network mapper”) is one of the most popular free network discovery tools on the market. Over the past decade or so the program has emerged as a core program for network administrators looking to map out their networks and conduct extensive network inventories. It allows the user to find live hosts on their network systems and scan for open ports and operating systems. In this guide, you will learn how to install and use Nmap.
 
Nmap runs centered around a command line similar to Windows Command Prompt, but a GUI interface is available for more experienced users. When using Nmap scanning, the user simply enters commands and runs scripts via the text-driven interface. They can navigate through firewalls, routers, IP filters, and other systems. At its core, Nmap was designed for enterprise-scale networks and can scan through thousands of connected devices.
 
Some of Nmap’s main uses include port scanning, ping sweeps, OS detection, and version detection. The program works by using IP packets to identify available hosts on a network as well as what services and operating systems they run. Nmap is available on many different operating systems from Linux to Free BSD and Gentoo. Nmap also has an extremely active and vibrant user support community. In this article, we break down the fundamentals of Nmap to help you hit the ground running.
 
## Network Analysis and Packet Sniffing with Nmap
 
Network analyzers like Nmap are essential to network security for several reasons. They can identify attackers and test for vulnerabilities within a network. When it comes to cybersecurity, the more you know about your packet traffic, the better prepared you are for an attack. Actively scanning your network is the only way to ensure that you stay prepared for potential attacks.
 
As a network analyzer or packet sniffer, Nmap is extremely versatile. For example, it allows the user to scan any IP active on their network. If you spot an IP you haven’t seen before, you can run an IP scan to identify whether it is a legitimate service or an outside attack.
 
Nmap is the go-to network analyzer for many administrators because it offers a wide range of functions for free.
 
### Nmap Use Cases
 
For example, you can use Nmap to:
 
- Identify live hosts on your network
 - Identify open ports on your network
 - Identify the operating system of services on your network
 - Address vulnerabilities in your network infrastructure

 
## How to Install Nmap
 
See also: Nmap Cheat Sheet
 
Before we get to how to use NMap, we’re going to look at how to install it. Windows, Linux and MacOS users can download Nmap here.
 
### Install Nmap on Windows
 
Use the Windows self-installer (referred to as nmap-<version>setup.exe) and then follow the onscreen instructions.
 
### Install Nmap on Linux
 
On Linux, things are a little trickier as you can choose between a source code install or a number of binary packages. Installing Nmap on Linux allows you to create your own commands and run custom scripts. To test whether you have nmap installed for Ubuntu, run the nmap --version command. If you receive a message stating that nmap isn’t currently installed, type sudo apt-get install nmap into the command prompt and click enter.
 
### Install Nmap on Mac
 
On Mac, nmap offers a dedicated installer. To install on Mac, double-click the nmap-<version>.dmg file and open a file called nmap-<version>mpkg. Opening this will start the installation process. If you’re using OS X 10.8 or later, you might be blocked by your security preferences because nmap is considered an ‘unidentified developer’. To get around this, simply right-click on the .mpkg file and select Open.
 
## How to Run a Ping Scan
 
One of the basics of network administration is taking the time to identify active hosts on your network system. On Nmap, this is achieved through the use of a ping scan. A ping scan (also referred to as a discover IP’s in a subnet command) allows the user to identify whether IP addresses are online. It can also be used as a method of host discovery.  ARP ping scans are one of the best ways to detect hosts within LAN networks.
 
To run an ARP ping scan, type the following command into the command line:
 
# nmap -sp 192.100.1.1/24
 
This will return a list of hosts that responded to your ping requests along with a total number of IP addresses at the end. An example is shown below:
 
It is important to note that this search doesn’t send any packets to the listed hosts. However, Nmap does run a reverse-DNS resolution on the listed hosts to identify their names.
 
## Port Scanning Techniques
 
When it comes to port scanning, you can use a variety of different techniques on Nmap. These are the main ones:
 
- sS TCP SYN scan
 - sT TCP connect scan
 - sU UDP scans
 - sY SCTP INIT scan
 - sN TCP NULL

 
Newer users will attempt to solve most problems with SYN scans, but as your knowledge develops you’ll be able to incorporate some of these other techniques as well. It is important to note that you can only use one port scanning method at a time (although you can combine an SCTP and TCP scan together).
 
### TCP SYN Scan
 
sS TCP SYN Scan
 
The TCP SYN Scan is one of the quickest port scanning techniques at your disposal on Nmap. You can scan thousands of ports per second on any network that isn’t protected by a firewall.
 
It is also a good network scanning technique in terms of privacy because it doesn’t complete TCP connections that draw attention to your activity. It works by sending a SYN packet and then waiting for a response. An acknowledgment indicates an open port whereas no response denotes a filtered port. An RST or reset identifies non-listening ports.
 
### TCP Connect Scan
 
sT TCP Connect Scan
 
A TCP Connect Scan is the main alternative TCP scan when the user cannot run a SYN scan. Under TCP connect scan, the user issues a connect system call to establish a connection with the network. Instead of reading through packet responses, Nmap uses this call to pull information about each connection attempt. One of the biggest disadvantages of a TCP connect scan is that it takes longer to target open ports than a SYN scan.
 
### UDP Scan
 
sU UDP Scan
 
If you want to run port scanning on a UDP service, then UDP scans are your best course of action. UDP can be used to scan ports such as DNS, SNMP and DHCP on your network. These are particularly important because they are an area that attackers commonly exploit. When running a UDP scan, you can also run a SYN scan simultaneously. When you run a UDP scan, you’re sending a UDP packet to each targeted port. In most cases, you’re sending an empty packet (besides ports like 53 and 161). If you don’t receive a response after the packets are transmitted, then the port is classified as open.
 
### SCTP INIT port scan
 
sY SCTP INIT Scan
 
The SCTP INIT port scan covers SS7 and SIGTRAN services and offers a combination of both TCP and UDP protocols. Like the Syn scan, the SCTP INIT Scan is incredibly fast, able to scan thousands of ports every second. It is also a good choice if you’re looking to maintain privacy because it doesn’t complete the SCTP process. This scan works by sending an INIT chunk and waiting for a response from the target. A response with another INIT-ACK chunk identifies an open port, whereas an ABORT chunk indicates a non-listening port. The port will be marked as filter if no response is received after multiple retransmissions.
 
### TCP NULL Scan
 
sN TCP NULL Scan
 
A TCP NULL scan is one of the more crafty scanning techniques at your disposal. This works by exploiting a loophole in the TCP RFC that denotes open and closed ports. Essentially any packet that doesn’t contain SYN, RST or ACK bits will prompt a response with a returned RST if the port is closed and no response if the port is open. The biggest advantage of a TCP NULL scan is that you can navigate your way around router filters and firewalls. Even though these are a good choice for stealth, however, they can still be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS).
 
## Host Scanning
 
If you want to identify active hosts on a network, then the host scan is the best way to do this. A host scan is used to send ARP request packets to all systems within a network. It will send an ARP request to a specific IP within an IP range and then the active host will respond with an ARP packet sending its MAC address with a ‘host is up’ message. You will receive this message from all active hosts. To run a host scan, enter:
 
nmap -sP <target IP range>
 
This will raise a screen showing the following:
 
## Identify Hostnames
 
One of the simplest and most useful commands you can use is the -sL command, which tells nmap to run a DNS query on your IP of choice. By using this method, you can find hostnames for an IP without sending a single packet to the host. For example, input the following command:
 
nmap -sL 192.100.0.0/24
 
This returns a list of names relating to the IPs scanned, which can be incredibly useful for identifying what certain IP addresses are actually for (providing they have a related name!).
 
## OS Scanning
 
Another one of Nmap’s useful functions is OS detection. To detect the operating system of a device, Nmap sends TCP and UDP packets to a port and analyzes its response. Nmap then runs various tests from TCP ISN sampling to IP ID sampling and compares it to its internal database of 2,600 operating systems. If it finds a match or fingerprint, it provides a summary consisting of the provider’s name, operating system, and version.
 
To detect the operating system of a host, enter the following command:
 
nmap -O 192.168.5.102
 
It is important to note that you require one open and one closed port in order to use the –O command.
 
## Version Detection
 
Version detection is the name given to a command that allows you to find out what software version a computer is running. What sets it apart from most other scans is that the port isn’t the focus of its search. Instead, it tries to detect what software a computer runs using the information given by an open port. You can use version detection by typing up the -sV command and selecting your IP of choice, for example:
 
#nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
 
## Increasing Verbosity
 
When running any scan through Nmap, you might require more information. Entering the verbose command -v will provide you with additional details on what Nmap is doing. Nine levels of verbosity are available on Nmap, from -4 to 4:
 
- Level -4 – Provides no output (e.g. you won’t see response packets)
 - Level -3 – Similar to -4 but also provides you with error messages to show you       if an Nmap command has failed
 - Level -2 – Does the above but also has warnings and additional error messages
 - Level -1 – Shows run-time information like version, start time, and statistics
 - Level 0 – The default verbosity level that displays sent and received packets as well as other information
 - Level 1 – Same as level 0 but also provides detail on protocol details, flags and timing.
 - Level 2 – Shows more extensive information on sent and received packets
 - Level 3 – Show the complete raw transfer of sent and received packet
 - Level 4 – Same as level 3 with more information

 
Increasing the verbosity is great for finding ways to optimize your scans. You increase the amount of information that you have access to and provide yourself with more information to make targeted improvements to your network infrastructure.
 
## Nmap Scripting Engine
 
If you want to get the most out of Nmap, then you’re going to need to use the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE). The NSE allows users to write scripts in Lua so they can automate various networking tasks. A number of different script categories can be created with the NSE. These are:
 
- auth – scripts that work with or bypass authentication credentials on a target system (such as x11-access).
 - broadcast – scripts typically used to discover hosts by broadcasting on the local network
 - brute – scripts that use brute force to gain access to a remote server (for example http-brute)
 - default – scripts set by default on Nmap based on speed, usefulness, verbosity, reliability, intrusiveness, and privacy
 - discovery – scripts that search public registries, directory services, and SNMP-enabled devices
 - dos – scripts which can cause denial of service. Can be used to test or attack services.
 - exploit – scripts designed to exploit network vulnerabilities (for example http-shellshock
 - external – scripts that send data to external databases such as whois-ip
 - fuzzer – scripts that send randomized fields within packets
 - intrusive – scripts that risk crashing the targeted system and being interpreted as malicious by other administrators
 - malware – scripts used to test whether a system has been infected by malware
 - safe – scripts that aren’t considered intrusive, designed to exploit loopholes, or crash services
 - version – used under the version detection feature but cannot be selected explicitly
 - vuln – scripts designed to check for vulnerabilities and report them to the user

 
The NSE can be quite complicated to get your head around at first, but after the initial learning curve, it becomes much easier to navigate.
 
For example, entering the command -sC will allow you to use the common scripts native to the platform. If you want to run your own scripts, you can use the –script option instead. It is important to remember that any scripts you run could damage your system, so double check everything before deciding to run scripts.
 
## Alternatives to Nmap
 
Although regular users of Nmap swear by it, the tool does have its limitations. Newcomers to network administration have learned to expect a GUI interface from their favorite tools and better graphical representations of network performance issues. The en-map adaptation of Nmap (see below) goes a long way towards addressing these needs.
 
If you don’t want to use a command line utility, there are alternatives to Nmap that you could check out. SolarWinds, which is one of the world’s leading producers of network administration tools, even offers a port scanner. The analytical functions of Nmap are not so great and you may find yourself researching other tools to further explore your network’s statuses and performance.
 
Although Nmap is a command line tool, there are many competing system available now that have a graphical user interface, and we prefer these over the dated operations of Nmap.
 
#### Here is our list of the five best alternatives to Nmap:
 
- Zenmap EDITOR’S CHOICE Produced by the developers of Nmap. This is the official GUI version of the network discovery tool., Offers a respectable mapping service for free. Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix.
 - Paessler PRTG A network monitoring package that includes SNMP for discovery and also creates a network inventory. The network maps of this tool are exceptional. Runs on Windows Server.

Paessler PRTG Network Monitor uses the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to locate all of the devices on your network and provide real-time monitoring capabilities. Once each piece of equipment has been discovered, it is logged in an inventory. The inventory forms the basis of the PRTG Network Map. You can reorganize the map manually if you like and you can also specify customized layouts. The maps aren’t limited to displaying the devices on one site. It can show all of the devices on a WAN and even plot all of the company’s sites on a real map of the world. Cloud services are also included in the network map.
 
- Network discovery
 - Network inventory and topology map
 - Live network monitoring

 
The network discovery function of PRTG runs continually. So, if you add, move, or remove a device, that change will automatically be shown in the network map and the equipment inventory will also be updated.
 
Each device on the map is labeled with its IP address. Alternatively, you can choose to have devices identified by their MAC addresses or their hostnames. Each device icon in the map is a link through to a detail window, which gives information on that piece of equipment. You can change the display of the network map to limit it to devices of a particular type, or just show one section of the network.
 
Paessler PRTG is a unified infrastructure monitoring system. It will also keep track of your servers and the applications running on them. There are special modules for monitoring websites and the monitor is able to cover virtualizations and wifi networks as well.
 
Paessler PRTG is available as an online service with a local collector agent installed on your system. Alternatively, you can choose to install the software on the premises. The PRTG system runs on Windows computers, but it can communicate with devices running other operating systems. PRTG is available for download on a free trial.

Datadog Network Device Monitoring is one of two network monitoring systems presented by the Datadog cloud platform. The other is the Network Performance Monitoring service, which focuses on measuring traffic.
 
- Device discovery
 - Port mapping
 - Constant health checks

 
The monitoring tool searches a network for all of the switches and routers that connect it together and then scans each device to get its details, such as make and model. The tool will also list the ports and the devices that are connected to them.
 
As operations progress, the Network Device Monitor keeps checking on the network equipment through SNMP procedures. It requests status reports from device agents and then compiles these into live performance data in the Datadog console. Activity is shown in graphs and charts as well as tables.
 
The system provides alerts if a device agent reports a problem and it will also set performance expectation thresholds on all of the metrics that it gathers. You can customize these alerts and even rearrange the dashboard screens.
 
The Datadog system is a subscription service and the cloud-based monitor will install an agent on your network to gather data. You can examine this network monitor with a 14-day free trial.
 
- Shows a live record of device performance
 - Offers automated monitoring with alerts
 - Provides a forecasting utility

 
- Traffic analysis is a separate module

 
### 4. Site24x7 Network Monitoring
 
Site24x7 Network Monitoring provides both device monitoring and traffic analysis. This service will discover all of the devices on your network and create a network inventory and a topology map. The system is able to identify the activity on the device as a unit and per port.
 
- Device status monitoring
 - Traffic analysis
 - Autodiscovery

 
This package uses SNMP to track the activities of switches, routers, and firewalls. It uses NetFlow and similar facilities to track network traffic patterns. This combination of services means that you have all aspects of network device monitoring in one package. As well as watching over devices, the network monitor will track the performance of VPNs, voice networks, load balancers, wireless access points, and office equipment, such as printers and UPSs.
 
Both the network inventory and the topology map are interactive. They let you click through to see the details of a device and its current activity. The dashboard also lets you set up performance expectation thresholds that will trigger alerts if crossed. You will also get an alert if an SNMP device agent sends a Trap warning about a device status problem.
 
The Site24x7 cloud platform also includes server and application monitoring services and you choose a package of services from a list of bundles. All of the plans include network monitoring.
 
This Site24x7 system is a cloud platform and it can monitor any network anywhere as long as you download a data gathering program onto the local network. You can get to know this monitoring package with a 30-day free trial.
 
- Network monitoring supplemented by server and application monitors

The software for this infrastructure monitoring tool installs on Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, and 2016. The first run of the utility will kick off the network discovery routines. These log all of the Layer 2 and Layer 3 devices (switches and routers) on your network and record them in a register. The discovery process also generates a network map. The logging system keeps running constantly so any changes in the network will be reflected in the map. Cloud-based services that your company uses also get included on the map and you can cover multiple sites to plot your WAN on one map.
 
- SNMP-based
 - Autodiscovery
 - Creates a network inventory
 - Live network topology map

 
The discovery process of WhatsUp Gold uses Ping and SNMP routines. The type of devices is also registered. This helps the monitor adjust processes accordingly for each type of equipment. A detailed popup attached to each icon in the map will show you details about that piece of equipment.
 
The statuses of the devices in the network system are monitored with SNMP. The map shows the health of each device with color: green for good, yellow for warning, and red for bad. So, you can see at a glance how all of those pieces of equipment are doing. Network link status is also highlighted with color: green for good, yellow for warning, and red for congested.
 
You can get a Network Traffic Analysis add-on for WhatsUp Gold to get deeper intelligence on the performance of your network. This gives you greater troubleshooting capabilities through the insights on network performance both by link and end-to-end.
