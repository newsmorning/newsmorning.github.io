The scenic views and candid shots were outstanding. We couldn’t believe that they had been lost and forgotten for so long.\nWe decided to investigate these photographs further and find out the story behind them.

It’s fascinating to explore the contents of old phones and discover stories and memories that we never could have anticipated finding.\nSo, are you inspired to dig through your old phone stash and see what you can uncover?
