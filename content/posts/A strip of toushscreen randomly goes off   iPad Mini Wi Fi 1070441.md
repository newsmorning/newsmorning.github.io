Is Your iPad Mini Wi-Fi Possessed?! Find Out Why Its Touchscreen is Randomly Going Off!

You’re sitting on your couch, enjoying some Netflix on your iPad Mini, when suddenly the screen starts to go crazy. The touchscreen is randomly going off, tapping apps and flipping pages without any input from you. What’s going on? Is your iPad Mini haunted by some sort of technological ghost?

Thankfully, the answer is no. Your iPad Mini isn’t possessed by some sort of supernatural force, but it might be experiencing a common issue that iOS users have been dealing with for years: Wi-Fi interference.

To understand why this happens, it’s important to review how Wi-Fi works. Wi-Fi signals are transmitted over frequencies that can be disrupted or blocked by physical barriers, like walls and doors. In areas with lots of Wi-Fi signals competing for attention, signal interference can occur, leading to distortions in the signal that can affect wireless devices.

One possible cause of iPad Mini touchscreen issues is when a Wi-Fi signal interferes with the frequency being used by the touchscreen. When the frequency is disrupted, your device might interpret a false touch event and trigger an app or action that you didn’t intend.

Another possible reason for these issues is electromagnetic interference. Electronic devices that generate strong electromagnetic fields, like microwaves and Bluetooth devices, can affect your iPad Mini’s touchscreen performance.

Thankfully, there are a few simple and cheap solutions to these issues. Start by restarting your iPad Mini and disconnecting from Wi-Fi networks. If the problem persists, try moving away from Wi-Fi hotspots or other electronic devices. In some cases, adjusting your Wi-Fi settings may also help to resolve the issue.

In conclusion, there’s no need to fear a possessed iPad Mini. It’s simply an issue that most Apple device owners have dealt with at one point or another. By understanding how Wi-Fi signal interference and electromagnetic interference works, you can take proactive steps to minimize disruptions to your device’s touchscreen. With some patience and troubleshooting, you’ll be back to enjoying your favorite shows and apps without any interruptions in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 Weird thing. After I slightly droped my iPad (on it’s back) I started noticing unpleasant behaviour - a vertical “strip” of digitizer periodically turns off with no impact from outside. I simply hold it and slightly touch the screen, and 1 time it works flawlessly, 1 time doesn’t at all
But if I do a hard reset (home + power buttons) the issue is seemingly gone. For some time…
I opened it up and reconnected the digitizer connector, but it seems to get worse
Does that signal the screen is broken (visually it’s absolutely ok) or do digitizers die instantly? Can’t get whether it’s time to get a replacement or is it software/connector related. And is there a cure aside from replacement (heating it, for instance)?
OS restore is unlikely to happen as I’ve got Jailbreak and plenty of tweaks I’ll not be able to reinstall (Cydia is down).

 The digitizer itself could have been damaged from the impact even though there is no visible damage.  I would try another digitizer/glass and see if this resolves your problem.

 I got it working finally. I turned out to be not as simple!
After I did a Lightning replacement some time ago I didn’t notice the right placement for a coaxial cable laying in the bottom of assembly. I stuffed it under the speakers and THAT WAS WRONG MOVE, as they lifted a bit. So when I glued the screen it had a stress on the bottom. I didn’t even notice it as it was laying flush. But after a drop something interrupted there and it touch started glitching.
I suspect it needs a replacement anyway, but for now it works.

 A little note (I think if we’ll find the solution it would be helpful for others so excuse my tediousness :P)
To check the screen I try to type a text. It’s getting harder as a half of the screen glitches now, and what I found - quite often when the key does not print a character I HEAR THE SOUND OF THE KEY PRESSED!
So it actually registers the touch.
Also, sometimes touch gets a little hysteria like I use second finger somewhere. So now I suspect like it thinks like there’s a phantom touch!
WTF? How to diagnose this? What could be the cause?
PS. I use http://spark.attrakt.se/ for the tests. JB and tweaks are disabled
