If you own an iPhone 6, you know how important the home button is. It allows you to navigate through the phone, access all your apps, and most importantly, go back to the home screen. However, if your iPhone 6 home button is not working properly, it can be frustrating and can even prevent you from using your phone. But don't worry, there is a secret to fixing your iPhone 6 home button, and it's not as difficult as you might think!

First, let's look at why your home button may not be working. It could be due to a hardware issue, such as a cracked or damaged button, or it could be a software issue, which means the button is not responding to your touch. Before you attempt any home button repair or replacement, you need to know what's causing the problem.

If you're confident that it's not a hardware issue, you can move on to trying to fix it yourself. Here's the secret to fixing your iPhone 6 home button:

1. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility.
2. Scroll down to AssistiveTouch and turn it on.
3. A floating button will appear on your screen. Tap it to access the home button function.
4. You can use this virtual home button instead of your physical home button.

This workaround is a lifesaver if your physical home button is broken or not responding. However, if it's a hardware issue, you may need to replace the home button. It's best to take your iPhone to a professional repair shop or Apple store to have it repaired or replaced properly.

In addition to the workaround mentioned above, you can also try some simple troubleshooting methods to fix your home button. These include:

- Restart your iPhone: A simple restart can often fix software issues.
- Clean your home button: Sometimes dust or debris may be blocking the button, preventing it from functioning properly. Use a clean, dry toothbrush to gently brush away any particles.
- Update your iOS: Updating to the latest iOS version can sometimes fix software issues.

In conclusion, the secret to fixing your iPhone 6 home button is to use the AssistiveTouch feature. However, if it's a hardware issue, you may need to have it repaired or replaced by a professional.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey!
Today I repair my phone (iphone 6) screen replacement on a firm, after the change is so weird Home button.
button works perfectly when the phone is unlocked. but when the phone has been locked in maybe 1 minute, then do not work at all, then I have to press the power button on the side, afterwards operate the Home button again until the phone locks the next time.
Please help me, are curious and want to know if it's something simple wrong or I have to run back with it and use the guarantee

 If you replaced the screen, maybe it is defective or a cable is not seated correctly. You may also need to clear your fingerprint scans and  re-enter them. I haven't tried replacing the screen on my 5S, so I am just guessing. I would try the settings before opening the phone up again. See if the fingerprint home button even works as a fingerprint reader. The home button only unlocks the screen if your fingerprint reads first.

 I had this exact same problem. Although my touch id didnt work either. When i changed my screen i had to move the back shield metal plate from my phone to the new screen. That back metal shield plate has the home button connector on it. I believed i damaged the home button connector when I disconnected the home button from my old screen, i can see the connector was now quite loose when i touched it. I decided to change the metal shield plate (you can buy it of ebay for like $10-$15). Once changed my home button now works fine. It also fixed my touch id which I wasn't expecting. Bonus!

 I know this is an old post but i hope it helps someone else.
