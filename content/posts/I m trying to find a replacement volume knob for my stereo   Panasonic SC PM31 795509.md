Title:  You Won't Believe What I Found While Searching for a Replacement Volume Knob for My Panasonic SC-PM31 Stereo!

Introduction:

Music is an essential element in our daily lives, and music systems are one of the best ways to enjoy it. I have been using my Panasonic SC-PM31 stereo for years and after a lot of wear and tear, the volume knob stopped working. I started searching for a replacement volume knob, but what I found was way beyond my expectations. In this article, I will share my experience of what I found and how it was a significant turning point in my life.

Body:

I started my search for a volume knob by looking online for a replacement. Although I found many options, they all seemed too generic and dull. I wanted something unique and personalized, but I didn't know where to look.

One day, while browsing online, I stumbled across a website that offered customized volume knobs. Being intrigued, I decided to check it out. The website offered various knobs with different designs but the one that caught my attention was a volume knob with an image of the solar system.

I was mesmerized by the design, and I knew right away that this was what I was looking for. I decided to order the knob and waited eagerly for its arrival.

A few weeks later, the knob arrived, and I was not disappointed. It was beautiful and perfectly matched my taste. I installed it on my stereo, and it looked like it was always meant to be there. But that was not all.

The website had sent me a small note, thanking me for my purchase and asking me to give some feedback on their products. I replied, thanking them for the excellent job they had done and also inquired about their work. It turned out that the company was founded by a group of artists who wanted to turn their passion into a business.

They offered personalized volume knobs, but they also created handcrafted guitar pedals, which were works of art themselves. The company, based in a small town near the coast, had a small studio where they designed and crafted their products.

I was so fascinated by their work that I decided to take a trip to their studio, which was an adventure in itself. When I reached the studio, I was blown away by the creativity and craftsmanship of their products. The studio was filled with amazing works, from guitar pedals with intricate designs to personalized knobs of all shapes and sizes.

I was also impressed by the dedication and passion of the artists who designed and crafted these unique pieces. It was then that I realized that there was a whole world of creative artists out there who were following their passion and making a living doing what they loved.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, my search for a volume knob led to a discovery that changed my perception of art and creativity. I learned that there are many talented artists out there who are passionate about their craft and are creating unique products that express their individuality.

My experience with this small company reminded me that art can come in many forms and that supporting local artists and small businesses can make a big difference. I am so grateful that my desire for a replacement volume knob led me to this discovery, and I hope that it inspires others to seek out and support local artists and businesses.

## Chosen Solution
 I'm trying to find a volume knob for my stereo do you have any

 Hi @vinyllover_86
Ifixit does not carry any parts for your player.
Seems like you may be out of luck.
The Panasonic part number for the Volume Control knob is RGWV0035-S This part is no longer available.
An equivalent part is RGW0406-S1.  This part is also no longer available
The original part number is the same for both the SA-PM31E (see page 114 item #20) and also the SA-PM31P (see item #19) models.
The closest that I could find was a RGW0406-S (scroll down the list to find it) which may not be exactly the same as an -S1. The list was accurate as of 27/03/2021 so you may have to contact the seller if you wish to enquire further.
