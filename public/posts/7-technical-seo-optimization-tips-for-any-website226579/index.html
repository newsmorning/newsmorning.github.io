A whole area of content optimization and page structure also exists. Here, we are only concerned with the fundamentals.\n1. Conduct An Audit Before you can perform technical SEO optimization, you need to understand what improvements your site needs and where potential problems exist.\nThis is why you should conduct a technical SEO audit. Once you complete it, you will be able to put together an actionable list of to-dos.\nThere are several technical SEO audit tools you can use, such as Screaming Frog SEO Spider and Google Search Console.\n2. Improve Server Response Time Server response time is defined by how long it takes a webpage to load. Google will crawl your website looking for coding inefficiencies that are slowing down your page speed. They recommend aiming for a server response time of less than 200ms. There are several free tools you can use to determine the load time of your web pages such as GTmetrix, Google PageSpeed Insights, and Pingdom Speed Test. You should also use a page speed guide which will highlight each step of the page speed audit for your site and recommend solutions.\nNot only do slow loading pages affect your rankings, but they also have a negative impact on user experience. This results in higher bounce rates, less time spent on a page, and fewer conversions.\nBelow are a few ways to increase your server response time:\nMinify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML: Remove redundant or unnecessary data such as commas, spaces, formatting, code comments, and other characters. If you use WordPress, WP Rocket is a plugin that simplifies the process.Compress your files: Use an application such as Gzip to reduce the sizes of your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files.Use browser caching: JavaScript files, stylesheets, and images should be cached so that your entire page doesn’t have to reload every time the same user lands on it.Minimize page redirects: When your webpage redirects to another page, the visitor must wait longer for the page to load.Optimize your images: Reduce the size of your image files without sacrificing the quality with tools such as JPEG Optimizer, CompressNow, and TinyPNG. 3.

To learn more, read Robots.txt Specifications from Google.\n5. Use SEO-Friendly URLs Search engine-friendly URLs contain keywords relevant to the topic of the page. Also avoid using underscores, hyphens, spaces, and other characters.\nYour URLs should be logical and organized.

Fix Broken Links \u0026 Pages User experience plays a vital role in how your website ranks in the search engines. If one of your pages shows a 404 error, it means you are linking to a page that doesn’t exist.\nGoogle can’t crawl broken pages, and users don’t like being sent to non-existent pages. If you delete or unpublish a page, you will break the link. Before you remove a page, set up a 301 redirect. Users will be taken to the new page and won’t see a 404 error.\nIf you are using WordPress, there are some valuable WordPress SEO plugins that can help complete these auditing tasks quickly.\nOr you can use Google Search Console. Log into your account and click on Coverage. If there are any errors on your page, you will see them listed in red.\nOnce you identify broken links, you can fix them. When you are done, submit a new sitemap to Google. Good technical SEO optimization doesn’t happen overnight. It is often overlooked in favor of on-page SEO and link building. However, it is just as essential to fix technical issues on your site. Be diligent – monitor, review and check your website regularly to perform better in the search engine results.\n","wordCount":"1648","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Herman Osborn"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/7-technical-seo-optimization-tips-for-any-website226579/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revamp Your Website's SEO Game with These 7 Technical Optimization Tips Today!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 12, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1648 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Herman Osborn</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-optimize-your-websites-speed>1.

Below are some anchor text best practices to follow:</p><ul><li>Use two or three-word phrases Avoid keyword-stuffing Use a combination of exact match and partial match Link to important pagesDon’t use the same anchor text for more than one page</li></ul><p>One way to audit and optimize your internal links is to use the Google Search Console.</p><p>Your highest priority pages should be getting the most internal links.</p><h2 id=7-fix-broken-links--pages>7. Fix Broken Links & Pages<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-fix-broken-links--pages>#</a></h2><p>User experience plays a vital role in how your website ranks in the search engines. If one of your pages shows a 404 error, it means you are linking to a page that doesn’t exist.</p><p>Google can’t crawl broken pages, and users don’t like being sent to non-existent pages. If you delete or unpublish a page, you will break the link. </p><p>Before you remove a page, set up a 301 redirect. Users will be taken to the new page and won’t see a 404 error.</p><p>If you are using WordPress, there are some valuable WordPress SEO plugins that can help complete these auditing tasks quickly.</p><p>Or you can use Google Search Console. Log into your account and click on Coverage.  If there are any errors on your page, you will see them listed in red.</p><p>Once you identify broken links, you can fix them. When you are done, submit a new sitemap to Google.  </p><p>Good technical SEO optimization doesn’t happen overnight. It is often overlooked in favor of on-page SEO and link building. However, it is just as essential to fix technical issues on your site. Be diligent – monitor, review and check your website regularly to perform better in the search engine results.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/linux-startup-taking-too-long-chart-it-970183/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Is Linux Startup Driving You Crazy?
