# LG Refrigerator and Freezer Stopped Staying Cool - How to Save Hundreds on Costly Repairs!

If you're an LG refrigerator and freezer owner, you know how important it is to keep these appliances running smoothly. Unfortunately, even the best appliances can sometimes malfunction. If your LG refrigerator and freezer stopped staying cool, there are a few things you can do before calling a repair person.

## Check the Thermostat

The first thing you should do is check the thermostat. It's possible that someone in your household accidentally adjusted the temperature settings, causing the refrigerator and freezer to stop working effectively. If this is the case, adjust the thermostat to the recommended temperature (37 degrees Fahrenheit for the refrigerator and 0 degrees Fahrenheit for the freezer) and wait a few hours to see if the temperature improves.

## Clean the Coils

Another issue that could cause your LG refrigerator and freezer to stop staying cool is a buildup of dust and debris on the coils. These coils are located on the back of the refrigerator and freezer and they are responsible for removing heat from the appliance. If they are dirty, they can't work effectively. To clean the coils, use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any debris. Make sure to unplug the refrigerator before cleaning the coils.

## Check the Door Seals

If the door seals on your refrigerator and freezer are damaged or not properly sealing, warm air can get in and cause the temperature to rise. Check the seals by closing the door on a piece of paper or a dollar bill. If you can easily pull the paper or bill out, the seals need to be replaced. You can purchase replacement door seals online or from an appliance parts store.

## Check the Condenser Fan

The condenser fan is located near the compressor and it's responsible for cooling down the refrigerant after it's passed through the compressor. If the fan isn't working properly, the refrigerant won't cool down and the temperature in the refrigerator and freezer will rise. To check the fan, unplug the refrigerator and remove the back panel. If the fan is dirty or not spinning, clean it and try spinning it manually. If it still doesn't spin, you'll need to replace it.

## Call a Professional

If none of the above solutions solve the problem of your LG refrigerator and freezer stopping to stay cool, it's time to call a professional. Most LG appliances come with a warranty and contacting the manufacturer is a great place to start. If your warranty has expired or you want to find a local repair service, check online reviews to ensure you're choosing a reputable company.

Conclusion:

If your LG refrigerator and freezer stopped staying cool, don't panic! There are several simple and cost-effective solutions that might help before calling a professional. The key is to take action quickly to prevent spoilage of your food items. With some troubleshooting, you may be able to save hundreds of dollars on costly repairs.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an Lg French door refrigerator with an in door ice maker. It is 2 years old.  The refrigerator and freezer arent cold. The compressor is working as well as the compressor fan. The condenser is clean and free of dirt. I took the inside of the refrigerator apart and evaporator fan and ice maker fan are both working. One of the lines going into the evaporator is a little cold but mostly the lines are warm on the evaporator coil. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas. I had two different techs over to look at it and they both told me something different. Thanks so much

 LG bottom freezer refrigerators are notorious for failing compressors. LG will cover the part but not the labor for a new compressor.
But, there are other possibilities as well! Check the LG fridge not cooling wiki for troubleshooting steps.

 It is possible your system could need a freeon recharge.
