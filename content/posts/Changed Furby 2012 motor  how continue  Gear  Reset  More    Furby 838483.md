# Unleash the Secret Powers of Your Furby: Learn How to Reset, Change the Motor, and Upgrade the Gear for an Ultimate Furby Experience!

Furby is a beloved toy that has been around since the late 90s. It has evolved over the years, but one thing remains the same: it still captures the imagination of kids and adults alike. But did you know that you can unleash the secret powers of your Furby by learning how to reset, change the motor, and upgrade the gear? In this article, we will discuss these three methods to help you unlock the full potential of your Furby.

## Resetting Your Furby

Resetting your Furby can resolve any issues you may have with its behavior. Here are the steps to reset your Furby:

1. Turn your Furby upside down.
2. Press and hold the reset button, located under its tail, with a small object such as a paperclip.
3. While still holding the button, turn your Furby on.
4. Wait until your Furby goes silent.
5. Release the reset button.

Your Furby should now be reset to its default settings. If you have any trouble following these steps, you can check the instruction manual that came with your Furby or look for online tutorials.

## Changing the Motor

Changing the motor can improve the performance of your Furby. Here are the steps to change the motor of your Furby:

Your Furby should now have a new, more responsive motor. Make sure to use a motor that is compatible with your specific Furby model.

## Chosen Solution
 Our zebra striped Furby 2012 had a hard fall and became "narcoleptic". Waking up, no movement, half opened lit eyes, talking a little and just shutting off within half a minute. Following other posts, I opened the Furby, was able to remove the 6V DC motor and test drive it and see it was no longer functioning. Ordered a new motor on Ebay, got it installed and now.... what?
Now I have new problems and need help. Furby moves and sounds but is completely maniac. I suspect that the gearing needs to be in a starting position, but I have no Idea how to get there. I only find results for old Furby gear online. There may also be something else, but I've come to the end of ideas.
Anyone that has come this far and managed to solve it? Other ideas? Anything is appreciated.

 Ok so once you get the 6V DC motor, you’ll need to solder it on the pre existing motor wires, you got the furby moving which is good, but the sound is an issue. So if its coming from the speaker, the speaker might be damaged from the fall and sadly might need replacing. If it’s just the gears grinding, I recommend using WD40 lubricant, it will help a smoother flow of movements and limit the sound. If you feel as if you can’t do anything else with the gears, you could find a replacement at stores such as Skycrafts or RadioShack. I’m hoping some of these pictures may help:
