If you own an Apple A1466 Macbook Air from 2015, you may be in for an unpleasant shock. Reports have emerged of a significant number of these devices suddenly failing to power on, leaving owners with an unresponsive and seemingly dead machine. If you're one of the Macbook Air owners affected by this problem, read on to find out what's going on and what you should do next.

##The Problem

The problem appears to have started affecting Macbook Air models from mid-2015, with numerous users reporting that their devices simply won't turn on or boot up. In some cases, the computer makes an audible click or chime, and the Apple logo appears on the screen before the machine shuts down again. In other cases, the Macbook Air won't make any noise or show any signs of life whatsoever.

##The Cause

The exact cause of the problem isn't clear, but there are some theories. Some suggest that it may be related to a software update issued by Apple, while others point to a hardware issue with the device's logic board. In any case, it appears that the issue is affecting both 11-inch and 13-inch Macbook Airs.

##The Solution

If you're experiencing this problem, the first thing to try is a hard reset. To do this, hold down the power button for around 10 seconds until the device shuts down. Then, wait a few moments and try to turn it on again. If this doesn't work, you should contact Apple support for advice.

The good news is that Apple is aware of the issue and is offering free repairs for affected devices. If your Macbook Air is covered by Apple's warranty or AppleCare, you should be able to get it repaired at no cost. If your warranty has expired, however, you'll likely need to pay for the repair.

##Conclusion

If you own an Apple A1466 Macbook Air from 2015, it's worth being aware of this issue. While there's no guaranteed way to prevent it from happening, you can take steps to ensure that your device is backed up regularly and that you have a plan in place in case it suddenly fails to power on. If your Macbook Air is affected by this issue, don't panic - there are steps you can take to get it repaired and back up and running again.

## Chosen Solution
 Have a Macbook Air here that will not power on anymore. The light on the magsafe connecter comes on when it is plugged in and turns orange but nothing happens when the power switch is pressed.
From what i’m told it first just started to not power on then a few weeks later it would suddenly power on when tried then the owner was afraid to switch it off and left it powered on and it went to sleep after which it never powered on again.
I’ve opened it and disconnected the battery and it still does not power on when the magsafe is plugged in .
I’ve a good few years experience repairing PCBs but the only equipment i have at home is a multimeter. Can anyone point me in the direction of test points or a guide to troubleshooting this? I’m fairly competent with electronics repairs so please go into detail if possible.
Thanks in advance anyone! Any help will be greatly appreciated!

 Any sign of liquid damage in this MBA ? Did you remove the logic board and made a visual inspection of the two sides (magnification would help). It takes only a little corrosion on a critical component to kill the board.
