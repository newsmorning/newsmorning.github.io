Title: My iMac Screen Went Haywire After Changing My Power Supply: Shifted Display Now Only Using Half the Screen!

Subtitle: A Brief Guide on Resolving Display Issues on iMac After Replacing the Power Supply

As a professional graphic designer, my iMac is an integral part of my daily tasks. Recently, I had to replace my iMac's power supply due to a faulty component. However, I was not prepared for what happened next - my display suddenly shifted, with only half of the screen showing images and texts! I was baffled and scared that my iMac had become useless.

If you have encountered similar challenges with your iMac after altering the power supply, then this article is for you. I'll explain what causes iMac display issues after power supply replacement and how to fix them.

Why Does Replacing the Power Supply Cause Display Issues on iMac?

Your iMac's display is connected to the motherboard through a data cable that controls the images shown on the screen. When you alter the power supply, there's a chance that this cable may get disconnected or damaged, causing your iMac's display to go haywire.

How to Fix iMac Screen Issues After Replacing the Power Supply?

The first thing you need to do when you notice any display problems is to shut down your iMac and unplug all external connections. Then, you can try any or a combination of the following solutions, depending on the nature and level of the issue.

1. Check the Display Data Cable

The first solution you should try is to check the display data cable situated on the back of your iMac. Ensure that the cable is fully connected to the motherboard and in a secure position. If there's any loose connection, try unplugging and replugging the cable back into the motherboard. You may need to use a screwdriver to remove the back cover of your iMac to reach the display data cable.

2. Reset the System Management Controller (SMC)

The SMC controls various hardware components of your iMac, including the display. Sometimes, resetting the SMC might help fix any display issues after replacing the power supply. Here's how to reset the SMC on your iMac:

- Shut down your iMac and unplug all external connections.
- Press and hold the power button for at least 15 seconds.
- Release the power button and reconnect the power cable to your iMac.
- Press the power button to boot your iMac.

3. Reset the NVRAM or PRAM

The NVRAM or PRAM stores various settings, including display resolution and refresh rate. Sometimes, resetting the NVRAM or PRAM might help fix any display issues after replacing the power supply. Here's how to reset the NVRAM or PRAM on your iMac:

- Shut down your iMac and unplug all external connections.
- Press the power button to turn on your iMac.
- Press and hold the Command + Option + P + R keys simultaneously before your iMac boots.
- Keep holding the keys until your iMac restarts and you hear the startup chime twice.
- Release the keys and let your iMac boot normally.

4. Seek Professional Help

If none of the solutions above fixes the display issues on your iMac, then it's time to seek professional help. Take your iMac to an authorized Apple technician, and they'll diagnose and repair the issue correctly.

In Conclusion

Don't panic if your iMac's display goes haywire after replacing the power supply. The solutions above will help you fix the issues and get your iMac back to normal. However, always remember to exercise caution when working on sensitive hardware components like the display data cable to avoid causing more damage.

 This will happen when the LVDS connector is damaged or the LVDS cable is not seated properly  in the connector.
Disconnect the screen and check the LVDS cable on the screen side, the connector on the motherboard (is tinny and fragile) and make sure you connect properly the cable on the motherboard side.
