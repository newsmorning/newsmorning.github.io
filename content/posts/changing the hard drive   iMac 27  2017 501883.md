Title: You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Upgrade Your iMac 27's Hard Drive!

Introduction:
The iMac 27 is a powerful machine that provides excellent performance and seamless experience. However, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, you might feel reluctant to purchase a new unit because of the expense. The good news is that upgrading the hard drive on your iMac 27 is a lot easier than you might think. In this article, we discuss the steps to upgrade your iMac 27's hard drive and how you can save money in the process.

Step 1: Check the Compatibility
Before you start the upgrading process, you need to ensure that the new hard drive is compatible with your iMac 27. You can confirm the model by clicking on the "About This Mac" option from the Apple menu. Additionally, you need to check the iMac 27's hard drive type and specs.

Step 2: Get the Right Tools
The second step is to get the necessary tools for the process. These tools include a screwdriver, suction cups, and a plastic tool for prying the screen. You can purchase these tools from your local store, or you can borrow them from a friend or a repair shop.

Step 3: Back up Your Data
Before you proceed to remove the hard drive, you need to back up all your data. You can use Time Machine or any other backup software to backup your data on an external hard drive or cloud storage. Once you have backed up your data, unplug the iMac 27 from the power socket and detach all the cables.

Step 4: Remove the Screen
Use the plastic tool to gently pry the screen from the aluminum frame. Be careful not to apply too much pressure to avoid damaging the screen. Once you remove the screen, detach the thermal cable and the camera cable.

Step 5: Remove the Hard Drive
Now that you have removed the screen, you can access the hard drive. Use the screwdriver to remove the screws holding the hard drive in place. You can then remove the hard drive from the iMac 27.

Step 6: Install the New Hard Drive
Install the new hard drive by fixing it in the same position as the old one. Secure it with screws and reconnect the cables back in their places. Reattach the screen, and you are done with the hardware part of the upgrade.

Step 7: Restore Your Data
Now that you have upgraded your hard drive, you need to restore your data. Connect the external hard drive or cloud storage with your backup and follow the on-screen instructions to restore your data.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, upgrading your iMac 27's hard drive is not as complicated as you might think. With the right tools and steps, you can save money on purchasing a new unit while improving your computer's performance. However, if you are not confident in performing the upgrade process yourself, you can seek the services of a professional.

## Chosen Solution
 i was wondering if the guide for changing the hard drive and the cpu of the imac 5k 2017 the same as the one for the 2013-2015 model

 No, the guides are not the same. The CPU is soldered to the Logic Board so replacing that is not possible.
I did find a HDD Replacement video online though.
