Are you a proud owner of a Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012? If yes, then you need to know the shocking truth - your beloved laptop is at risk without a particular type of charging cord. Are you wondering about the details? Keep reading to know the importance of this charging cord and why it is necessary to get it now.

Firstly, let's talk about the charging cord that comes with your Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012. It is the Magsafe 1 charger, which has a magnetic connector that easily attaches and detaches from the laptop. This feature is helpful as it prevents accidental trips and falls that can damage not only the charger but also the laptop's charging port. However, like everything else, even Magsafe chargers have a lifespan.

Now, let's come to the shocking truth - counterfeit chargers. The market is flooded with knock-off Magsafe chargers, which can be tempting due to their cheap price tag but are incredibly dangerous. These counterfeit chargers are often wrongly wired, which can lead to a severe risk of electrical shock, damage the battery, and even fry the entire laptop.

Additionally, if you're using any Magsafe charger other than the original one, Apple offers no warranty, even if your laptop is under warranty. It means you'll have no luck with Apple customer support if your laptop gets damaged due to the use of a counterfeit charger.

So, what's the solution? Get the Magsafe 1 charger from an authorized Apple reseller or Apple store. These chargers go through strict quality control checks and meet stringent safety standards, ensuring the safety of your laptop and yourself.

Moreover, if you're planning to travel overseas, don't forget to carry the appropriate adapter as international power outlets vary. You don't want to end up in a foreign country with a dead battery and no charger, do you?

In conclusion, don't compromise on your laptop's safety and well-being by using counterfeit chargers. Get the original Magsafe 1 charger now and prevent a costly disaster. Remember, prevention is always better than cure. Stay safe!

## Chosen Solution
 I am hoping to buy a new cord as mine is kinked and not working properly.

 IFIXIT doens’t offer parts for the Mac chargers. I personally don’t recommend replacing the cords as often times you can’t make the needed quality connections as they can in the factory. The cords the selves also have circuitry which ID’s them so you can’t just throw any cord on either.
Bottomline is safer for you and your system just to replace the MagSafe charger.
