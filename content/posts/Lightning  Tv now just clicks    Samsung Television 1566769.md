Shocking News! Lightning Strikes Samsung TV, Now All it does is Click!

It was a dark and stormy night, and all of a sudden, lightning strikes your Samsung TV. The worst has happened, and all it does now is click, the screen is blank and there is no sound. Many people may wonder, what can be done in such a circumstance? How can the beloved Samsung TV be revived and restored to its former glory? Let’s explore more on this topic.

The first question people may ask is, how does lightning affect electronic devices, especially televisions? Well, lightning is a powerful force that can travel thousands of miles in the atmosphere. When it strikes a television, it can send a surge of electricity that can be too much for the sensitive components of the television to handle. This can cause damage to the TV's circuits, power supply, and other components, resulting in the television not working correctly or not working at all.

If your Samsung TV has experienced a lightning strike and it has stopped working, it is not time to panic yet. The first thing to do is to unplug it immediately. This will prevent any further damage to the TV, and it will also protect you from getting electrocuted. Do not power the TV back on at this time.

The next step is to inspect the TV carefully to see if there are any visible signs of damage. Check for any obvious burn marks or melted components as they can be an indication that some components of the TV were directly affected by the lightning strike. If the TV's outer shell is damaged, it’s essential to have it checked.

In some cases, a lightning strike may have caused minor damage to your TV that can be fixed with relatively little effort. For example, a fuse may have blown or a capacitor may have discharged. These types of problems can be rectified by replacing the faulty components, and the TV can be restored to its full functionality.

However, if the damage is more severe, then it may be necessary to take it to a professional. They can assess the extent of the damage and determine if it is repairable or if the TV would need to be replaced.

In conclusion, a lightning strike on a Samsung TV is undoubtedly an unfortunate occurrence. However, with the appropriate measures taken promptly, the TV can still be fixed and return to its proper function. The most important thing is to ensure your safety first by unplugging the TV immediately when it happens. If you are not sure, it is always best to seek the help of a professional. Hopefully, with the correct steps taken, you follow them and get to enjoy a functional Samsung TV once again.

## Chosen Solution
 A few days ago I had a very similar situation. Lightning. Tv now just clicks. I have the rear  cover off and do not have any bulged or leaking caps. Checking voltage as it clicks on each cap.  Don’t know what to do from here.  UN46B6000
When I unplug the harness going to the main board I see the backlight turn on and clicking stops.  Clicking returns once plugged in.

 @usasquint
this again sounds like a main board issue. If you disconnect to the cable from the power supply to the main board, check to see if your backlight comes on and stays on. Post some images of all of your boards with your question. That way we cans see what you see. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that. I am more leaning toward bad IC’s and/or relays than capacitors.
