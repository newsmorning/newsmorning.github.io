Do you struggle with your Outlook email signature? Have you noticed that it's not displaying correctly or is even missing entirely? There are a few common reasons why your signature may malfunction and we have five fixes that you need to try right away.

## 1. Ensure that Your Signature is Enabled

This might sound like a no-brainer but it's important to first check that your signature is enabled in Outlook. Go to File > Options > Mail and scroll down until you see the Signatures section. Ensure that the "Signature" radio button is checked and that a signature is selected in the dropdown menu. If this step hasn't solved your issue, then try the next fix.

## 2. Check Your HTML Formatting

Outlook email signatures are created using HTML code which can occasionally become corrupted, causing problems with how the signature appears to others. Ensure that there are no unclosed tags, incorrect formatting, or HTML code errors in your signature. If you're not HTML-savvy, it's always best to use an email signature generator or template designed specifically for Outlook.

## 3. Delete Corrupted Signatures

If your Outlook signature is still not behaving as expected, then it's possible that the signature file has become corrupted. To remedy this, go to your Outlook signature folder and delete the corrupted signature files. Restart Outlook and recreate your signature.

## 4. Increase Available Disk Space

A lack of available disk space on your computer can cause many things to malfunction including your Outlook email signature. If you're noticing that your email signature is disappearing, try increasing the available space on your disk drive. Delete old files or programs you no longer need, or invest in an external hard drive to store your data.

## 5. Reinstall Microsoft Office

If all else fails, it's worth reinstalling Microsoft Office. Windows updates can sometimes corrupt the software and cause issues with Outlook including email signature malfunctions. Uninstall the program, restart your computer, and then download and reinstall the software from the official Microsoft website.

In conclusion, an Outlook email signature can be a valuable addition to your professional email communications. To ensure that it is functioning correctly and displaying as intended, try these five fixes in order. If you are still having issues, then it's time to consult with an Outlook specialist or IT support team. Don't let a malfunctioning signature impact your professional image, take action now and get back to communicating with confidence.
