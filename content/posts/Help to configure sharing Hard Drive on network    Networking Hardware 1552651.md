# Unlock the Secret to Effortless File Sharing with These Easy Networking Hardware Tricks!

Effortlessly sharing files across a network is a dream come true. From seamless collaboration to quick access to essential documents, file sharing is essential for any organization. While there are various software solutions available for file sharing, hardware networking tricks can significantly enhance the experience. In this article, we’ll explore some easy networking hardware tips to unlock the secret of effortless file sharing. 

## Invest in a Network Attached Storage Device 

A Network Attached Storage (NAS) device is a hardware device that operates as a centralized data storage system for all network-connected devices. It offers an easy way to share files, media, and other data across different devices without using any external hard drives or USB drives. A NAS device is an excellent solution for small offices, home offices, or even large organizations. It provides a highly scalable and centralized setup for efficient and secure file sharing. 

## Use a Gigabit Ethernet Switch 

A Gigabit Ethernet switch is a high-speed hardware networking device that allows you to connect multiple devices to a network. It provides an easy way to expand your existing network and enables faster file transfers between connected devices. With a Gigabit Ethernet switch, you can achieve speeds of up to 10 Gbps, compared to the older 100 Mbps standard. It’s an excellent investment for organizations that need to transfer large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. 

## Upgrade to a Wireless AC Router 

A Wireless AC router is the latest networking technology that provides faster and more robust wireless connectivity. It operates on the 802.11ac wireless standard and offers speeds of up to 1.3Gbps, compared to the older 802.11n standard. With a Wireless AC router, you can achieve better wireless coverage, improved signal strength, and faster file transfers. It’s an excellent investment for any organization that relies on wireless connectivity for file sharing, online collaboration, or other critical tasks. 

## Set Up a VPN Connection 

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection provides a secure and private way to access files over a network. It encrypts all data transmitted between connected devices, making it impossible for unauthorized users to access your data. A VPN connection is an excellent solution for organizations that need to share confidential and sensitive data across different locations. With a VPN connection, you can ensure secure and private file sharing without worrying about security breaches or data theft. 

## Conclusion 

Effortless file sharing is essential for any organization that wants to stay productive and competitive in today’s digital age. While software solutions are useful, hardware networking tricks can significantly enhance the experience. By investing in a Network Attached Storage device, using a Gigabit Ethernet Switch, upgrading to a Wireless AC Router, and setting up a VPN connection, you can unlock the secret to effortless file sharing. With these simple hardware tricks, you can improve your organization’s productivity, collaboration, and security.

 Hi Guys.
Ok hopefully one of you can help here.
I have just got a d link DIR-1960 | AC1900 Smart Mesh Wi-Fi Router which I have set up as an access point in the games room so my children can play xbox playstation ETC & it works fantastic.
Our isp is bt total broadband and in the house we have the black wifi disks the game room is a separate building away from the house which has a wired cat6 network cable to it & we get around 490 to 515mbps the same as we get to wired devices in the house wifi with the disks we get around 380 to 450mbps on wifi in the games room with the mesh router its around the same but more stable for the gaming consoles. we did try a wifi disk but even though the speeds were there they would occasionally cause the game to lag funny it was always when my son was about to score the winner in the World Cup or champions league on Fifa. since we installed the mesh router there have been 0 issues with this so all in all its working perfectly.
To have this as an access point on the network I have changed the IP address of the router from the default to one which doesn’t interfere with any others on the network & it works perfectly & I can connect remotely to another Mac I have down there which I use an a local media server if I were to set this up as a separate network not an access point I would not be able to connect remotely to it.
The router also has the feature to share a hard drive on the network as it has a USB 3 port on it & I have connected a hard drive to this.
I can see the hard drive is connected in the settings of the router & I can set it up with 3 different connections UPnP, Samba & ftp. (see pic 1)
UPnP has a name for UPnP media server
Samba it activated
FTP is activated
I can’t connect to it at all no matter what I try
smb:// 192.***.*.**
or ftp://192.***63
using connect to server in finder smb attempts to connect to server but then fails with message (see pic2)
when I try ftp it at least gives me option to sign in as a registered user which does try but again this fails the log in box wobbles when it fails.
Any of you guys with a bit more knowledge of networking or how to use these protocols I would greatly appreciate any help or advice with this.
Thank you in advance.

 The 1960 manual provides NO information about USB connection except that it is there. This manual may help

I have Asus routers so I am not familiar with Dlink.

 @inthebox -  I think I know your problem but  need a bit more to see what needs the correction. Can you create a drawing so I can see the pathing between the system/s you want to connect to your drive. As an example:

Use letters for the different nets and subnets
