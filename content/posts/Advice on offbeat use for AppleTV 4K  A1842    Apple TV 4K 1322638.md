## Chosen Solution
 Hello, hope everyone is staying safe & keeping well!
As the title  suggests, I have an offbeat & very specific use for a spare ATV4K I  have.
I'm intending to strip all the innards & just keep the logic  board & power it with a TalentCell 12v Lithium Ion Battery Pack.
I'm wondering if this is possible since the ATV4K A1842 model draws 12v @ 1.083A.
I'm planning to use this for a portable AirPlay unit to  display my PowerPoint presentations remotely in 1080p resolution (or  less) TV sets.  I will also be using it to mirror my iPhone's video when  I fly my DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone.
My iPhone & modded ATV4K w/battery  pack will always be close together for Peer-to-Peer adhoc connections using AirPlay.
Any confirmation or suggestions would be greatly  appreciated!

 I do think this is a reach! The space the power supply takes is not really large enough for the needed  power pack. Besides you would still need the cooling fan.
I think its would a lot less work to mod the system so it can be powered via DC, then just have the pack external to the unit.
