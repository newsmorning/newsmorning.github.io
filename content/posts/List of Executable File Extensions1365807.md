Introduction:

Computers have become essential in our daily lives, but with the advancement in technology, there are new threats and challenges to our digital safety, especially due to executable files. Executable files are programs or software that can run on your computer. These files are often a gateway for attackers who want to gain access to your sensitive data or damage your system. Therefore, it is essential to know about the different executable file extensions and how to protect your computer from malicious attacks.

Executable File Extensions:

Below are some common executable file extensions that you may come across while using your computer.

1. .exe (Executable File): .EXE stands for "executable," meaning this file can run on your computer. They're often used to start new software installations, run applications, or perform system diagnostics.

2. .dll (Dynamic Link Library): A DLL file is a kind of file that contains instructions for how Windows programs can access hardware devices and other software.

3. .jar (Java Archive): Java Archive files contain executable Java code, usually in the form of a utility program, an applet, or a Java-based game.

4. .com (Command File): A command file usually contains instructions that must be followed from the command prompt or in a batch file. Using command files can make it easier to automate tasks on your computer.

5. .bat (Batch File): A batch file is a set of commands stored in plain text that computers can execute. They're often used to automate repetitive tasks or run complex scripts.

How to Protect Your Computer from Malicious Executable Files?

Here are some useful tips to protect your computer from malicious executable files.

1. Keep your operating system and other applications up-to-date with the latest security updates and patches.

2. Install and regularly update your anti-virus software. This software will help detect and remove viruses and malware on your system.

3. Avoid downloading files from suspicious or unverified sources.

4. Be careful when opening email attachments, especially if the email is from an unknown sender. Always verify the sender's identity and be cautious if the email has any urgent or suspicious subject line.

5. Use strong and unique passwords for your computer and online accounts.

Conclusion:

By understanding the different executable file extensions and following the tips mentioned in this article, you can protect your computer from potential threats.

A file with an executable file extension means that the file format supports some ability to run an automatic task. This is in contrast to other file formats that just display data, play a sound or video, or otherwise present content without running a system command.

 
##   File Extensions Explained  
 

If you open a file with one of these file extensions, your computer could, without your continued permission, run one or more operations programmed into that file.

 

To put it in even simpler terms, these files either belong to programs, scripts, or program extensions and plugins. They're meant to run and do things on your computer, only you can't be sure exactly what they're running or doing. That's why it's always crucial to only run them when they come from a trusted source or website.

 

Those operations could be damaging if, for example, you were to run a virus-infected executable file that you received by email from someone you don't know.

 
##   High-Risk File Extensions  
 

We've rated the following executable file types as High Risk because essentially all computers with the listed operating system installed, execute the commands contained in the executable file.

 
Please exercise caution before opening these kinds of files, especially those received in suspicious emails or downloaded from unfamiliar websites. Use an online virus scanner on the specific file you're concerned about if you're not sure if it's safe (remember, though, that not all dangerous files are necessarily malicious, so those scanners shouldn't be your only line of defense).
 

In other words, files with the extensions listed below can be executed with some basic parts of Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. No additional program is required.

 

[1] To execute an INF file, you must open the pop-up menu (usually by right-clicking on the file) and choose Install.

 
##   Other Executable File Extensions  
 

The following file extensions are only executable if you happen to have the software installed that carries out the commands contained in the file.

 

If you do have one of the programs below installed, consider files with the associated extensions as executable and High Risk. If you don't have a particular program installed, and you try to execute a file with that extension, either a harmless error will appear or nothing at all will happen.

 

[1] "Original Scripting Engine" refers to whatever program created the script. It would be impossible to list, and keep updated, the number of scripting engines that might use these file extensions.

 
This is not a complete list of executable file extensions, nor is it a list of dangerous but non-executable file types.Â
