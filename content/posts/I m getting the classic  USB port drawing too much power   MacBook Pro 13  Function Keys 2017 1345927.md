Is Your MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 About to Explode? Find Out Why Its Classic USB Port is Drawing TOO MUCH Power!

The MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 is a popular device used by professionals across the globe. However, recent reports suggest that this device has a potential risk of explosion due to its classic USB port drawing too much power.

To understand this problem, we need to go back and look at the specs of the MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017. This device is equipped with two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports and two classic USB-A ports. While the USB-C ports support faster charging and data transfer speeds, the classic USB-A ports are still useful for connecting older devices.

The problem with the classic USB-A ports is that they draw too much power. When a device is connected to a USB-A port, it draws power from the MacBook Pro's battery. If the device requires more power than the USB-A port can handle, it draws additional power from the MacBook Pro's battery, which can overheat the battery and cause it to explode.

It is important to note that not all devices draw too much power from the classic USB-A port. Devices like a mouse, keyboard, or a flash drive do not require a lot of power and are safe to use with the MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017.

However, devices like an external hard drive or a smartphone that requires a higher power output should not be connected to the classic USB-A port.

To protect your MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 from potential explosion, it is recommended that you use a USB-C to USB-A adapter for connecting older devices that require a classic USB-A port. The adapter acts as a buffer between the device and the MacBook Pro's battery and prevents any potential overloading.

In conclusion, the MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 is a great device, but its classic USB-A ports can be potentially dangerous if not used carefully. Always check the power requirements of your device before connecting it to the classic USB-A port, and use a USB-C to USB-A adapter if necessary. Stay safe, and happy computing!

## Chosen Solution
 I'm on a MacBook Pro 13 2017 with no Touch Bar.
I'm getting the classic "USB port drawing too much power. The device that is plugged into it will be deactivated" or something like that (My MacBook is Swedish).
This problem occurs when trying to connect either a firewire interface using adapters, a Sandisk Extreme USB-C SSD or a Midi keyboard using Apple AV adapter.
I've tried several times reseting NVRAM and SMCI've tried changing USBC cables.I've tried booting the computer with all the accessories already connected.I've tried connecting the Sandisk SSD to my Apple AV adapter with power connected to the adapter

 Sadly, there is nothing you can do here as the logic board has a problem.
You’ll need to get your system to someone with the needed deeper skills to toubleshoot and repair your logic board or you’ll need to replace it.
