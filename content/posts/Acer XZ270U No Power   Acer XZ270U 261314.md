The Acer Xz270U is a wondrous gaming monitor with an astonishing 144Hz refresh rate, but it was doomed to fail us. Yes, it did. We lost power, and this monitor was left powerless too. Its screen went dark, and its blue LED light indicated that it was offline. We scrounged around, investigated the cause of the sudden blackout, and narrowed it down to a blown fuse. Then, without any delay, we decided to fix it.

So, what happened next?

When we tried to fix the Acer Xz270U, we were left exasperated. None of our attempts yielded success. We tried to replace the fuse, but it refused to budge. It was stuck and we couldn't just pull it out. We decided to use a pair of pliers, but that didn't help either. The fuse remained in place, leaving us with no alternatives.

Our next step involved using a multimeter. We wanted to test if the fuse had blown, but that was an intricate process, and we had little knowledge about it. We discovered that there were two types of fuses, and we weren't sure which type the Acer Xz270U used. We then spent hours scouring the internet for the manual or any other helpful resources, but all our efforts went in vain.

With the frustration levels at their peak, we decided to seek professional help. We contacted Acer's customer care, and after explaining the issue, they directed us to their service center. However, they informed us that the warranty had expired, and we would have to pay for the repair. Additionally, given the current circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic, it would take a few weeks before they could service the monitor. It was another setback for us.

Finally, we decided to call electricians to come help us out. They examined the fuse and realized that the fuse wasn't blown. The Acer Xz270U had a short circuit. Although we weren't knowledgeable enough to understand how it happened, the electricians got it fixed, and the monitor came alive once again.

In conclusion, trying to fix the Acer Xz270U was not an easy feat. It resulted in us wasting time and money. Ultimately, only the help of professionals came to our rescue. We learned that our impulse to fix something by ourselves can lead to more damage, and it's best to call in the professionals for assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently bought an Acer XZ270U off facebook marketplace that does not power on.
When I plug it in, there are no sounds, no lights, and the display remains off.
I already tried replacing the power supply that it came with, to no avail.  I am guessing itâ€™s something to do with the main board?  I went ahead and opened it up, here is a picture:



Anyone have any ideas?

 @redmaus looks like your main board is on the Fritz. The two larger capacitors appear to have swollen tops and thus have failed. At minimum I would replace all caps on that board.
