Thanks to the wonders of satellite technology, it’s never been easier to pinpoint your exact location than it is today. GPS technology, combined with apps like Google Maps, make it incredibly easy to find your coordinates or get accurate directions to your home, workplace, or to the nearest store.
 
Unfortunately, this level of accuracy has one big downside: privacy. Unless you want your friends and family to track your location, you may want to fake your GPS location on Android devices using third-party apps, as this isn’t possible on iPhones. To help you, here are seven of the best apps for GPS spoofing on Android.
 
## Mock GPS With Joystick
 
If you want a quick, easy-to-use GPS spoofer for Android, then the Mock GPS with Joystick app could be the app to use. This free GPS spoofer talks you through the steps you’ll need to take to set up location spoofing on Android as soon as it starts, including providing the app with the required permissions. 
 

 
Like most GPS spoofing apps, the interface is simple. It offers a Google Maps viewfinder, allowing you to find and pinpoint the spot for your fake location. Once you’ve found it, the app’s joystick mode allows you to move to that spot in real-time—or so your device thinks.
 
All-in-all, this is a travel spoofing app as well as a location spoofer. You can move from the spot you drop on, or you can stay in position. The choice is yours.
 
## Mock Locations
 
Like Mock GPS with Joystick, Mock Locations is an app that is part travel spoofer, part location spoofer. It’s probably one of the best designed apps on this list, with an easy-to-use interface that uses Google Maps data to help move your location or plan a fake travel route.
 
You can use it to create timings to pause on your fake route, alter the speed of travel, and even break around road bends to simulate real speeds during transportation.
 
Of course, if you want to move to an entirely new location instantly, Mock Locations will allow you to do that too. Like Mock GPS with Joystick, Mock Locations will also talk you through the steps you’ll need to take to set up GPS spoofing on Android.
 
This app offers a 24-hour trial period before you’re required to pay for unlimited access with an in-app purchase.
 
## Fake GPS – ByteRev
 
The simply-named Fake GPS is exactly that: it’s a simple-to-use GPS spoofer for Android devices that uses the Google Maps viewfinder to help you find and spoof different locations on your device.
 
With over 5 million installations, this app makes it extremely easy to fake your GPS location with your Android. You can save regular locations to your favorites list or randomize your movement using the app’s built-in settings.
 
If you’re having trouble getting things running, you can even use ADB commands to control the app and make your location even more accurate, directly from your PC or Mac.
 
## Fake GPS Go Location Spoofer
 
Don’t let the confusing name confuse you, because the Fake GPS Go Location Spoofer app is one of the best GPS spoofing apps you can use on Android. As the name might suggest, this is perfect for users who want to try and fake their GPS location for Pokemon Go and other Android apps and games where your location is used.
 
This app is offered for free, with features to match the others on this list, including direct location spoofing and location history and favorites lists. For paid users, things get a lot more interesting.
 
If you upgrade to the Pro version, you’ll be able to fake entire journeys, with customizable speeds and a joystick control for manual movements. Like Mock Locations, you can also set stopping points on your fake route for more realistic location spoofing.
 
For the Pokemon fans, this app also includes the locations of Pokemon Go Gyms and Pokestops to find your favorite characters. You’ve gotta catch them all, after all, but who said you had to leave the house to do it?
 
## GPS Emulator – RosTeam
 
If you need a simple GPS spoofer for Android, then the GPS Emulator app could be an option if other apps on this list aren’t working. This totally free app allows you to fake your GPS location on Android using a built-in Google Maps viewfinder, with a handy search bar to help you search for locations you recognize.
 
The interface is simple to use, with buttons at the bottom of the app to drop a pin on your fake location or to stop spoofing entirely. You can switch your map view to different modes, including satellite or terrain, to help you discover new places outside of typical urban areas.
 
There are no extra settings or features to worry about—this is a simple location spoofer that should help you move your location from A to B on your device.
 
## Fake GPS Location – Hola
 
If you want to go all-in on hiding yourself, you could combine a GPS spoofer with a VPN app to hide your IP address. Fake GPS Location is an app provided by a VPN provider itself—Hola VPN.
 
Like the other GPS spoofers on this list, this app gives you the ability to spoof your location using an easy-to-use search bar or map viewfinder. If you want to hide the places you’ve searched for, you can quickly wipe your location history in the app for extra security.
 
This app could work well if you’re a Hola VPN customer, but it’s also entirely free to use for other users. You could also combine it with another VPN provider to give you that extra protection against anyone snooping on your privacy.
 
## Fake GPS Location – Lexa
 
The Fake GPS Location app by the developer Lexa offers a great experience for GPS spoofing. It offers the press-and-go location spoofing that users will need, but it also offers some advanced features for professional users to consider.
 
For instance, you can combine it with the automation app Tasker to generate fake locations automatically. If you’re nearing a certain location, you could set this app to spoof your location to hide where you’re going.
 
Like the other apps on this list, you can search for locations, drop a pin on the built-in viewfinder manually, or consult a list of past fake locations. No cost required for this one—this spoofing app is totally free to use.
 
## Keeping Your Location Safe On Android Devices
 
With a fake GPS location app installed, you can hide your location from anyone bothering to look. Whether it’s your family you’re hiding from, or if you’re just trying to keep your location hidden from data-hungry apps on your phone, these apps make GPS spoofing on Android a simple process.
 
Before you fake your GPS location, you may be interested in the benefits that sharing your location can offer. If you want to, you can use Google Maps location sharing to help you track a lost loved one. This is especially important if you’re a worried parent, as you can use the technology in child tracking apps to keep them safe.
