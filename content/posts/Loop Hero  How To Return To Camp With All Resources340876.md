Are you tired of losing resources in the popular game Loop Hero? Do you want to learn effective tips to win every battle and never run out of resources? Well, you are in the right place.

Loop Hero is a game that requires a lot of strategy and planning to succeed. It can be frustrating to see all your hard work go to waste when you lose a battle and lose all your resources. But don't worry, we have compiled a list of ten effective tips on how to never lose your resources and crush Loop Hero.

1. Plan Your Deck

One of the most important things you can do in Loop Hero is to plan your deck. Make sure you have a balance of cards that can handle different situations. For example, you should have cards that can deal with melee enemies, ranged enemies, and bosses. Don't just add cards to your deck randomly. Consider each card's strengths and weaknesses, and develop a strategy around them.

2. Use the Pause Button

The Pause button is your best friend in Loop Hero. It allows you to take a breather and reassess the situation. When you pause the game, you can plan your next move without worrying about your character's health. Use this time to strategize, use potions or play cards. It will help you to stay alive for longer and avoid losing resources.

3. Know the Enemy

Each enemy in Loop Hero has its strengths and weaknesses. Make sure you know them so you can choose the right cards to counter them. For example, goblins deal physical damage, so you should have cards that deal physical damage in your deck. On the other hand, Slimes deal magic damage, so you should have Magic cards to counter them.

4. Use the Right Equipment

Equipping your character with the right items is essential in Loop Hero. Make sure you have items that boost your character's strengths and abilities. Choose items that provide health, damage, and defense. Don't hesitate to upgrade your equipment whenever you can. It can make a significant impact on your gameplay.

5. Use the Obstacles

The obstacles in Loop Hero can be annoying, but they can also be helpful. For example, the Forest can heal your character, while the Mountains can increase your attack speed. Place your character near the obstacles that can benefit your character the most. It can help you stay alive longer during battles.

6. Play Your Cards Wisely

Playing your cards at the right time can make all the difference in Loop Hero. Don't waste your cards on enemies that are about to die. Instead, save them for boss battles or when you are facing multiple enemies. Use your cards to block enemies that are about to deal a devastating blow to your character.

7. Know Your Limits

Don't be too greedy in Loop Hero. Know your limits and avoid battles that are too dangerous for your character. Sometimes it's better to retreat and save your resources for another day. It's better to lose some progress than to lose all your resources.

8. Use the Map

The Map in Loop Hero is a valuable tool that can help you avoid dangerous battles. Use the map to see which paths lead to safe areas or enemies that match your character's level. It can help avoid wasting resources on battles that you will likely lose.

9. Grind if Necessary

Sometimes, you need to grind in Loop Hero to succeed. If you're having trouble winning a battle, go back and play some easier levels to level up your character. It can make a significant impact on your gameplay and help you win harder battles.

10. Don't Rush

Last but not least, don't rush in Loop Hero. It's a game that requires patience and strategic planning. Take your time to plan your deck, choose the right items, and play your cards wisely. Rushing into battles can lead to disaster and losing all your resources.

In conclusion, Loop Hero is a game that requires patience, strategy, and planning. By using these ten effective tips, you can crush Loop Hero and never lose your resources. Plan your deck, use the pause button, know your enemy, and use the right equipment. Remember to use obstacles, play your cards wisely, and know your limits.

There are many reasons why you could get overwhelmed in this strategic roguelike RPG and at those moments, you will want to leave or retreat. It will not only help you rest, you will also get a much-needed refill on potions and more. How to make that happen? Look no further because our guide on how to return to camp in Loop Hero will help you out. Doing this has a certain advantage in terms of resources as well which we will discuss in this article.
 
## Loop Hero: How to Return to Camp?
 

 
Players can go back to the camp by clicking on the leave button present at the bottom right area of the screen indicated by a running man. You can click on it when you feel like you are not going to make it. In order to keep all the resources you have earned, make sure that you are on the campfire tile. Then, simply retreat with all the accumulated loot you have gathered.
 
Don’t wait until you have no potions or other healing left because it will lead to your death. Here’s what happens when you die in the game and you don’t want to lose out on that amount of resources. Remember that if you are at any tile other than the campfire one in the loop and you use the leave button, you will get to keep 60% of your resources that you have found.
 
Hence, it’s best to retreat at the right time because it’s better to leave the battlefield than to die without resources. When you click on the icon, you will get a pop up. This is where you can confirm if you want to Retreat or Stay. Click on Retreat to head back immediately.
 
So, there are three ways to return to camp in Loop Hero, all with different amounts of loot taken back. Depending on the situation you are in, you can take a decision accordingly, thereby affecting the resources as well. Once you are back at the base camp, you can begin planning and take on enemies all over again.
