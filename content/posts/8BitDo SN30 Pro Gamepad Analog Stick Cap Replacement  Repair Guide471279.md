# Revive Your Favorite Gamepad with this Simple Repair Guide – Say Goodbye to Analog Stick Issues!

Gamepads are the lifeblood of console gamers all over the world. They provide us with the ability to immerse ourselves in our favorite games and experiences without having to deal with the often cumbersome and awkward controls that come with keyboards and other input devices. However, like any electronic device, gamepads can sometimes experience various issues and faults that can affect their functionality. One of the most common issues is analog stick drift, which can be a real nightmare for gamers who rely on their gamepads to enjoy their favorite games. But fear not, because in this article, we will share a simple repair guide that can help you revive your favorite gamepad and say goodbye to analog stick issues.

### The Problem: Analog Stick Drift

Analog stick drift is a common issue that occurs in gamepads when the analog stick starts to register movement even when it is not being touched or moved. This can happen due to various reasons, such as dust accumulation inside the controller, worn-out parts or a damaged potentiometer, and can make gaming experience frustrating or even impossible.

### The Solution: A Simple Repair Guide

The good news is that repairing analog stick drift is relatively easy and can be done with a few simple tools and steps. Here's what you need to do:

#### Step 1: Open the Controller

First, you'll need to open up the controller to access the analog sticks. Most modern gamepads are designed to be opened up easily, with just a few screws holding them together. However, you may want to consult the manufacturer's website or a video tutorial to ensure that you do not damage any parts of the controller while taking it apart.

#### Step 2: Clean the Analog Stick

Once you have opened up the controller, you'll need to clean the analog stick using a cotton swab dipped in some isopropyl alcohol. Gently scrub the stick in all directions to remove any dust, dirt or debris that may have accumulated over time. Make sure that you clean the edges and base of the stick thoroughly, as these are the areas where most of the dirt collects.

#### Step 3: Replace the Potentiometer

If cleaning the analog stick does not solve the problem, it may be time to replace the potentiometer. The potentiometer is a small electrical component that detects the movement of the analog stick. If it is damaged or worn out, it can cause analog stick drift. You can easily find a replacement potentiometer online or at an electronics store. Unscrew the old potentiometer from the controller, and then screw in the new one. Make sure that you carefully align the new potentiometer with the circuit board and solder it in place.

#### Step 4: Reassemble the Controller

After cleaning or replacing the potentiometer, it's time to reassemble the controller. Put all the parts back together, ensuring that all the screws are tightened accordingly. Once you've put everything back together, test the gamepad to see if the analog stick drift is gone. If there are still issues, you may need to repeat the process or try alternative techniques like re-calibration or replacing the joystick module entirely.

### Get Ready to Game!

With this simple repair guide, you can revive your favorite gamepad and say goodbye to analog stick drift, allowing you to enjoy your favorite games and console experiences in comfort and ease. Whether you are a casual gamer or a pro, a well-functioning and responsive controller is essential for a seamless gaming experience. So, get ready to game on with your newly revived gamepad!

Step 7

                  Install the New Caps               


 
- 
 - Note the shape of the hole under the replacement analog stick cap and how it matches the shape of the analog stick shaft. Orient them correctly for a proper fit.
 - 
 - Take your new caps and push them into the shaft.
 - 
 - Push the cap all the way down until you hear a ‘click’, which is the analog button being pressed.
 - 
 - Make sure that the analog shaft stays straight and centered while you are pushing down on the cap.
 - 
 - The replacement caps sent by 8BitDo seem to be a newer, better silicon-coated variant, instead of the old caps that used rubber.

Great tutorial, but you don't need to remove the battery.

Thanks for this but do you know how to unclip the stick mechanism from the board?  I seemed to have broken one.  The button is not “clicking” on press right.  I have reached out to 8bitdo on how to order replacements.  I figured I would try and see if I could just reseat it and maybe that would fix the issue but can’t get the stick off the board.
 
Thanks.

I haven’t tried it myself, but from what I’ve seen, you may need to desolder the metal casing to get to the stick itself. If 8BitDo did send replacements, I would assume they’d send a whole assembly (both sticks + the board they’re soldered to). Please let us know if they get back to you; i’m very much curious. Thanks!
