Introduction:

The iPhone 7 is an incredible piece of technology that has revolutionized the world with its amazing features. However, over time, this device can develop faults, which can be frustrating for its users. One issue that iPhone 7 users have been facing is a refusal to charge or vibrate. The most likely culprit is a faulty lightning port. In this article, we will explore the lightning port replacement problems that iPhone 7 users face and what can be done to solve them.

Body:

So, why does the lightning port of an iPhone 7 develop faults? The most common reason is the accumulation of dirt and debris over time. This can obstruct the flow of electricity and affect the charging process. Another reason is that the lightning port could have been damaged. This could be due to rough handling, or a problem with the phone's charging cable. Whatever the reason, a faulty lightning port can be frustrating for iPhone 7 users.

If you are facing issues with your iPhone 7 refusing to charge or vibrate, you may have considered getting your lightning port replaced. While this may seem like a great solution to your problem, it comes with its fair share of challenges. For starters, the process of replacing a lightning port in an iPhone 7 requires skill and expertise. It is not something that should be attempted by amateurs or DIY enthusiasts. Instead, it is recommended that you take your device to an authorized service center for repairs.

When you take your iPhone 7 to an authorized service center for lightning port replacement, you may be in for a shock. The cost of repairs can be pretty steep, and you may be forced to spend a lot of money to get your device up and running again. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the replacement port will work as expected. Some users have reported issues such as the phone not charging or the lightning port not working immediately after replacement.

Conclusion:

If your iPhone 7 is refusing to charge or vibrate, you may need to get your lightning port replaced. However, be aware of the challenges that come with the process. Ensure that you take your device to an authorized service center for repairs and brace yourself for the cost of repairs. Moreover, be prepared to face issues with the replacement port not working immediately.

## Chosen Solution
 UPDATED
Hi all! I’ve seen some questions asking for solutions to similar problems but not 100% like mine.
I replaced the charge port in an iPhone 7 and after the repair I am having a number of issues.
Taptic Not Working - no vibration response to home button presses or silent switch flicks.Service constantly “Searching” -  no IMEI listed in settings eitherBattery icon reads 1% and not charging while connected. Stuck a new battery in that I know has charge and it’s still reading at 1% and no lightning symbol to show charging status.
I know the port works to an extent because the phone turns on when I plug it in but I’m experiencing all of the above issues. Anyone have the same experience and know a solution? I’m ordering a new premium charge port and trying that out but I wanted to see if anyone had any other ideas.

 A few thing to diagnose for the following:
Taptic Not WorkingAre you referring to the vibration feedback that you get when pressing the home button, flicking the vibrate / silent switch?Service constantly “Searching”.Check if IMEI is displayed in dialer by typing *#06#. Also check if IMEI and modem baseband is displayed in settings > general > about phone. Another thing to check is Sim detection to make sure it isn't permanently stuck on searching.Battery icon reads 1% and not charging while connected.For this one check if the connector for the battery cable is seated in fully. Other things to check would be the components around the connectors on the board for any pry damage. It could be that some components on the board may have gotten prayed off or damaged.

 Did you ever resolve this issue? I’m having the same problems as mentioned above after changing my lighting port.
