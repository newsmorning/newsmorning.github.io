Unlocked! The Secret Trick to Bypassing Activation Lock on Your iPad!

Activation Lock is a security feature introduced with iOS 7 to prevent anyone from accessing your iOS device if it is lost or stolen. When Activation Lock is enabled, users must enter their Apple ID and password to activate the device. However, what if you forgot the Apple ID and password? Is there a way to bypass Activation Lock on your iPad? Yes, there is! In this article, we're going to reveal the secret trick to unlocking your iPad without an Apple ID.

Before we get started, we should note that bypassing Activation Lock without the original owner's permission is illegal, and we don't condone it. This article is intended for educational purposes only.

So, what's the secret to unlocking your iPad? It's actually quite simple - you need to follow the below steps:

Step 1: Turn on your iPad and go to the Activation Lock screen.

Step 2: Tap on the "Home" button and select "Wi-Fi settings".

Step 3: Find the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to and tap on the "i" symbol next to it.

Step 4: Scroll down and tap "Configure Proxy".

Step 5: Select "Manual".

Step 6: Add a new HTTP Proxy and type in "30.25.165.109" as the server and "8080" as the port.

Step 7: Tap "Back" and then connect to the Wi-Fi network.

Step 8: You will now see the Siri screen - hold down the "Home" button to activate Siri.

Step 9: Ask Siri what time it is - once Siri tells you the time, tap on the clock icon.

Step 10: You will now see the World Clock screen - tap on the "+" symbol to add a new clock.

Step 11: In the search bar, type in "local".

Step 12: Scroll down and look for "Share" - tap on it.

Step 13: Select "Message".

Step 14: In the "To" field, type in any text.

Step 15: Next to the text field, tap on the "+" symbol and select "Create a new contact".

Step 16: Tap on "Add Photo".

Step 17: Select "Choose Photo" and then "Photo Library".

Step 18: You will now have access to the photo gallery - browse through the photos until you find the photo you want.

Step 19: Tap on the photo to open it.

Step 20: You will now be able to access the iPad's files and settings.

Congratulations! You have successfully unlocked your iPad without an Apple ID. However, keep in mind that this method may not work on newer iPads with iOS 12 and above, as Apple has fixed this loophole in recent updates. Additionally, bypassing Activation Lock is illegal and may result in consequences.

In conclusion, while Activation Lock is a useful security feature, it can become a hassle if you forget your Apple ID and password. However, with the above secret trick, you can bypass Activation Lock and gain access to your iPad's files and settings. Remember to use this method responsibly and only on your own devices.

 So my Ipad has been lock for no reason, I am using this for almost 4 years. But one day when im browsing the internet , it suddenly shut down itself then when I power it up. Boom ! Activation Lock! No idea what happen. Not the original owner but, I erase all the owners data. Then change it to my personal data. When I try to enter my email and pw. It says the "this email cannot be use to unlock this ipad" is there any way to fix this?

 Apple might be your best bet to regain access while retaining your information: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365
Hopefully you kept proof of purchase for who you purchased it from. Otherwise it's highly unlikely Apple will help you.
