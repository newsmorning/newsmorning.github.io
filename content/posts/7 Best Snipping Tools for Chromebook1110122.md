Taking screen grabs may be slightly different on a Chromebook than it is on a Windows or Mac computer. However, the process is simple whether you’re using the native method or a third-party snipping tool.
 
Whether you want to grab the entire screen or just a part of it, it’s easy to do with the keyboard commands. However, if this method doesn’t do what you want, you can get a suitable third-party alternative that meets your needs.
 
Read on to find out how to grab screenshots on a Chromebook using the keyboard shortcuts or a stylus, and the best snipping tools for Chromebook you can use to capture your screen.
 

 
## Best Snipping Tools for Chromebook
 
If you just want to capture your entire screen or a portion of it on your Chromebook, the easiest method is to use keyboard shortcuts.
 
To capture your Chromebook’s entire screen, press CTRL+Window Switch (Show Windows). If you just want to capture a specific area, hold down CTRL+Shift, press the Window Switch (Show Windows) key and use your trackpad to drag the crosshair icon and select the area you want to capture.
 
If your Chromebook comes with a stylus, you can use it to take full or partial screenshots and annotate, or use the Power+Volume Down buttons to take quick screenshots.
