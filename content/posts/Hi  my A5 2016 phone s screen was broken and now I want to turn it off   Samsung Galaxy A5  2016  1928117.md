 Hi, my A5 2016 phone’s screen was broken and now i want to turn it off to replace that
the touch is working , how can i shut it off ?
please help

 There are two ways that you can turn off this device. One way is to hold down the power button and wait for the pop-up menu to appear, then press “Power Off.”
If that way does not work, then hold and press the Power button and Volume down button until the screen turns black and then shows a menu. Use the Volume buttons to navigate through this menu until you find “Power Off/Shut Down.” Then, press the Power button and this should power the phone off. If it does not, please ask me again and I will help you if any way I can.
