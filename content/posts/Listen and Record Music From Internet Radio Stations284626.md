If you use a software media player such as iTunes, Windows Media Player, or Winamp, you can use these programs to listen to online radio stations. Most music is either streamed or downloaded. If you'd like to record internet radio, there are software programs that can do this by creating digital audio files like MP3s. Below is a list of free software programs that do an excellent job of recording online radio.

 
##  RadioSure Free 
 

RadioSure is a highly polished internet radio player that gives you access to over 2,000 radio stations. The free version has an impressive amount of options that allow you to record and listen.

 
- Hundreds of stations.
 - Can be installed as a portable app.
 - Lots of skins to customize the look.

 
- Can't sort search results.
 - Minimal online support.

 

The program is also intelligent enough to save each song separately and add basic music tag information. The interface is well designed and is also skinnable. There are a few free ones you can download from the RadioSure website.

 

To listen to an internet radio station, scroll through the list of available stations. For something more specific, a search box allows you to enter a genre or the name of a station.

 

The pro version offers enhancements such as recording songs from the beginning (if you didn't record straight away), more simultaneous recordings, hi-res cover art, and more.

 

Overall, RadioSure is a good solid option if you want to listen to internet radio and record it too. 

 
##  Nexus Radio 
 

Nexus Radio is primarily a music search program for finding your favorite songs, artists, and more. But, it also has an internet radio facility. You can use Nexus Radio to download music to your computer using its music search facility or play and record live broadcasts from one of the many web radio stations.

 
- Don't need an account to use.
 - App is completely free.
 - Lots of free extra tools.

 
- Software runs on Windows only.
 - Few useful plugins.

 

Other neat features include iPod and iPhone compatibility, ringtone creation, and an ID3 tag editor. Nexus Radio offers a vast resource of music and web radio stations that is still well worth the download.

 
##  Jobee 
 

Jobee, which is available as a free download for Windows, is a multi-talented software program. As well as being a suitable tool for listening to internet radio stations, it can also record streams as MP3s — although it doesn't split the recording into individual songs.

 
- Easy-to-use interface.
 - Useful RSS reader.
 - Handy media library.

 
- No longer being developed.
 - Windows only app.
 - Doesn't cleanly uninstall.

 

You can also use the media player to listen to the music stored on your computer. It's fairly basic as far as media players go, but it gets the job done. It also doubles as an RSS reader.

 

This software program isn't being developed now, but it still might be a useful tool if you need a web radio recorder that can also pull in RSS news feeds.
