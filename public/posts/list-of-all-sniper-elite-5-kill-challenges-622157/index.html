The game takes you on a journey to fight for victory and survival while tackling the toughest of enemies.\nThe Sniper Elite series has always been a favorite among gamers who enjoy the thrill of stealth, strategy, and of course, the use of sniper rifles. The developers of Sniper Elite 5 have ensured that the latest installment is an adrenaline pumped masterpiece that everyone will enjoy.\nSniper Elite 5 follows the story of a lone hero, Karl Fairburne, who is behind enemy lines, carrying out espionage and assassination missions during World War II. The game features an exciting plot, breathtaking visuals, and the most challenging kill missions ever seen in any game.\nLet us dive into the impressive list of kill challenges:\nSniper Duel: Get ready for the ultimate test of marksmanship, as you engage in a one-on-one duel with an enemy sniper. This challenging mission requires extreme patience, skill, and accuracy.\nTank Bust: In Tank Bust, you must sneak past enemy lines, place explosives on a tank, and then destroy it with a single shot. A single mistake can result in your untimely demise.\nTrain Takedown: In Train Takedown, you must jump onto a moving train and kill the enemy soldiers onboard. The train is moving so fast that you must master the art of aiming and timing your shots perfectly.\nCastle Siege: In Castle Siege, you lead a team of soldiers to infiltrate an enemy stronghold and eliminate all the hostiles. The challenge is formidable, and a small mistake could mean certain death.\nBridge Ambush: In Bridge Ambush, you must wait for a convoy to cross a bridge and then blow it up, taking everyone on it with it. The trick here is to plan your shots and timing correctly to ensure that you do not miss your targets.\nConclusion:\nThe upcoming Sniper Elite 5 is set to be an action-packed masterpiece that will leave gamers begging for more. It has pushed the limits of what can be accomplished with a sniper rifle and challenged the players to conquer their fears and marksmanship skills.\nThe game’s impressive list of death-defying kill challenges is guaranteed to leave gamers on the edge of their seats. Each challenge requires the player to use all their stealth, strategy, and sniping skills to survive.\nSo, can you survive the challenges? Do you have what it takes to be a sharpshooter? Be prepared for an experience like no other as Sniper Elite 5 is set to redefine what makes a great game in 2021.\nSniper Elite 5 is the latest installment in the Series by Rebellion Developments. It brings back the feels of scoping to your target against real-world variables and hitting near-impossible shots. The game as simple as shooting with a rich \u0026 complex backstory makes for a really fun time. Along with the lore of the game, there are 8 Main Missions that you will have to complete. Each Mission will have the main target that you will have to kill. Which is fine and all but there is a spicer way of doing it than the ordinary method. Each Mission has a Kill Challenge. It is a bonus Challenge during your Missions. In this guide, I will show all of the Kill Challenges in Sniper Elite 5 \u0026 how you can beat them.\nAll Sniper Elite 5 Kill Challenges Table of Contents\nIn Sniper Elite 5, Kill Challenges are bonus tasks that grant the player more rewards. There is one of them in each mission, i.e. 8 Kill Challenges to complete. They are usually on the final target of the corresponding Mission \u0026 you will be notified with a prompt on your screen. The Kill Challenges that you can do in Elite Sniper 5 are:\nFirst: Mission 1 – Kill Beckendorf with an Explosive. Second: Mission 2 – Kill Kummler by using the Chateau Chandeliers. Third: Mission 3 – Slay Richter by a Stealth Takedown. Fourth: Mission 4 – Assassinate Ehrlich by using a Rat Bomb. Fifth: Mission 5 – Beat Lanzo Baumann by Burying him in Concrete. Sixth: Mission 6 – Kill Trautmann with Poison. Seventh: Mission 7 – Use a V2 Rocket to slay Dr. Christian Junger. Eighth: Mission 8 – Use a Japanese Weapon to Assassinate Yoshikawa. As you can see, there are some interesting ways of completing these Challenges. These Kill Challenges are not as tough to execute as the situation will allow you to kill each Target without the need of setting up the Challenge.\nKill Challenge 1: Kill Beckendorf with an Explosive You will need to kill Beckendorf with an Explosive that you can get from the Armory. To know more about it, check our guide on Steffen Beckendorf on our website.\nKill Challenge 2: Kill Kummler by using the Chateau’s Chandeliers Once you get into position, you will have to wait for Kummler to get under the Chandelier. As gets under it, aim at the chain of the Chandelier and shoot it once it is highlighted in Red. If Kummler does not wish to stand there by himself, kill everyone else and knock him unconscious. This will make it easier than waiting.\nKill Challenge 3: Slay Richter by a Stealth Takedown Stealth Takedowns are not easy, especially when your Target is roaming with an entourage. Richter will be near the meeting room. Being sneaky is the key here. Make sure to save whenever you can. You could try and Stealth Takedown certain Guards \u0026 parts of the entourage.\nKill Challenge 4 in Sniper Elite 5: Assassinate Ehrlich by using a Rat Bomb This mission is similar to the first one. You will get the Rat Bomb at the beginning of the mission. Be Silent \u0026 Stealthy, plant the bomb near the Target, and kaboom.\nKill Challenge 5: Beat Lanzo Baumann by Burying him in Concrete This one may seem like it will be a difficult one. Well, if your Target is not moving then it’s not as tough. Just simply knock Lanzo out and drag him near a Cement mixer. You will see that there is a fresh Cement layer. Drop him in it or break the Wooden scaffolding under him. After a while, you will get the Challenge completed.\nKill Challenge 6 in Sniper Elite 5: Kill Trautmann with Poison Once you have collected the Bottle of Poison from the wooden box next to the stairs, you will need to spike a drink. Climb up the stairs and you find a glass near the room where Trautmann is in. Carefully pour the Poison into the glass \u0026 then knock on the door. Don’t worry as he will not exit the room till you knock on the door. Once you do, hide quickly as possible and watch him drink the Poison.\nKill Challenge 7: Use a V2 Rocket to slay Dr. Christian Junger This is another pretty simple Kill Challenge in Sniper Elite 5. In the Weapon’s Lab, you will find a few weapons that the V2 Rocket will be there. As usual, sneak around the place till you can get to the stairs. Go to the upper level \u0026 takedown the Guard there. Now just wait till Junger walks under the V2 Rocket and then just shoot the chains.\nKill Challenge 8: Use a Japanese Weapon to Assassinate Yoshikawa For this Kill Challenge, you just need a Japanese gun. You can get one after completing the 5th Kill Challenge, the Type 100. Get it from the Workbench before the Mission and make sure to assassinate Yoshikawa with it. I would suggest whipping it out only when you are going to face him.\nThis was all about the Kill Challenges in Sniper Elite 5. Hopefully, this guide has helped you.
