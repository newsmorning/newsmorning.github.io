Title: Did You Drop Your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge? Watch Out for This Sneaky Screen Issue!

Heading 1: Overview of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 

Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge is a popular smartphone model known for its curved screen, high-quality display, and impressive camera. Even though it has been around for a few years, it still remains a popular choice among Samsung users. However, one particular issue that often plagues these devices is screen-related problems caused by accidental drops.

Heading 2: The Issue with the Screen

When you drop your phone, it’s often the screen that suffers the most damage. While a visible crack or shatter is an obvious sign of screen damage, there are also hidden issues that you may not notice right away. One such issue is screen burn-in, a condition where remnants of an image remain visible even when you switch to a different app or screen. It’s known as ghosting, and it can be quite an annoyance.

Heading 3: Ghosting on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge 

The ghosting issue on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is not uncommon. It appears when you have accidentally dropped your phone and caused damage to the LCD display. If you notice that your phone’s screen appears discolored or has an image that seems to linger even after you have switched to a different app, you might be experiencing screen burn-in.

Heading 4: Prevention and Resolution 

The best way to avoid this issue is by preventing it from happening in the first place. You can invest in a strong protective case or put a tempered glass screen protector to reduce the risk of damage from drops. If it’s too late for prevention and you’re already facing this issue, the best solution is to get your phone repaired by an authorized service center. Don’t try to fix it yourself or take it to an unauthorized repair shop as this may end up making things worse.

Heading 5: Conclusion 

The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is still a great smartphone, but it’s not invincible. Accidental drops are a common cause for screen damage, and ghosting or screen burn-in is one of the hidden issues that can arise. Prevention is always the best policy as it can save you time and money in the long run. However, if you find that your screen has already been damaged, take it to an authorized repair center to have it properly fixed. With proper care, you can enjoy your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge for a long time to come.

## Chosen Solution
 My grandson cracked the side of my Galaxy S7 Edge. Now there is a line in the middle of the screen. Can anyone tell me what part to replace?

 I would check the connectors in case they maybe were jarred out of place, but if not then the LCD will need to be replaced. This is not likely going to be a cheap affair given how new the phone is.

 Reconnect the screen flex cable or replace a new screen. The cable may loose or the screen is broken.

 The same thing happened to me, although all apps are working, my s7 edge ...is flickering all the time...  Would that be a sign of a lose flex cable?  I tap the back side of my phone, where the flex cable is connected...then the image in my phone's screen changes.

 I picked up a MacBook Air on Craigslist for $100 with a dead, swollen battery & horizontal + vertical lines on the screen. Replacing the battery somehow triggered slow, fluttery,  goofy booting & a left shift key which doesn't work or uses ALL CAPS which can only be reset with a restart :-/  Upgrading the OS to macOS High Sierra did not help. After a few months, Apple updated macOS High Sierra, which fixed everything except the lines on the screen. I'm happy with this $100 MacBook Air now, lines on the screen included. I wish I only had 1 line on the screen :-)
