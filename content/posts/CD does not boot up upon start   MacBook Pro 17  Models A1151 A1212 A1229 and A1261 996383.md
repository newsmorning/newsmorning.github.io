# You Won't Believe Why Your MacBook Pro CD Won't Boot Up - 4 Models Revealed!

MacBook Pro is a popular laptop brand known for its sleek design, high performance, and advanced features. However, one common issue faced by MacBook Pro users is a CD that won't boot up. This problem can be frustrating, especially when you urgently need to access information from a CD.

In this article, we will discuss four MacBook Pro models along with the reasons why your CD won't boot up on them.

## Model 1: MacBook Pro 13-inch (Mid-2009)

One reason why CDs won't boot up on MacBook Pro (Mid-2009) is that Apple removed the optical drive from this device. This means that it cannot read CDs or DVDs, so if you are attempting to boot up a CD on this model, you are out of luck. 

## Model 2: MacBook Pro 15-inch (Late 2008)

MacBook Pro (Late 2008) was one of the first devices to come with an SD card slot. This model had a slot-loading SuperDrive that was compatible with CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. However, some users reported that their MacBook Pro (Late 2008) has trouble booting up CDs sometimes. This issue occurred because the device did not have a firmware update to support booting from SD cards, so booting from a CD was not always successful.

## Model 3: MacBook Pro 15-inch (Mid-2012)

If you have a MacBook Pro (Mid-2012) and your CD won't boot up, one of the reasons could be the device's USB ports. The issue occurred because these ports are USB 3.0, and some CDs did not have the necessary drivers to function correctly on this interface. The solution to this problem is to use an external SuperDrive or an external DVD drive that has a USB 2.0 interface to boot up the CD.

## Model 4: MacBook Pro 13-inch (Late 2016)

MacBook Pro (Late 2016) was one of the latest models from Apple, and it featured the Touch Bar – a thin OLED display that replaced the function keys. One of the significant changes introduced in this model was the removal of the traditional USB and Thunderbolt ports, which were replaced by USB-C ports. If you have a MacBook Pro (Late 2016), and your CD won't boot up, it could be because you need an adapter that allows you to connect an external CD/DVD drive to your device.

In conclusion, MacBook Pro is a beloved device that, like any other laptop, can face issues in certain situations. If you find yourself in a situation where your CD won't boot up, be sure to check the model of your device as the solutions vary depending on the model. If you are not sure what the issue is or how to fix it, it is best to seek professional help to ensure that the problem is resolved without causing further damage to your device.
