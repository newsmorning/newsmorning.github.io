# WARNING: Secure Your Internet NOW! Shocking default password for Linksys E4200 router revealed!

If you're using a Linksys E4200 router to connect to the internet, you might want to rethink your security measures. The default password, which is supposed to be a secret, has been revealed to the public, and it's shocking how easy it is to guess.

The Linksys E4200 is a popular router that's been on the market for years. It's known for its easy setup and fast speeds, but what users don't know is that the default password is simple that anyone could guess it. The default password is "admin."

Yes, you read that right. The default password for the Linksys E4200 router is "admin." This means that anyone who knows this password can connect to your Wi-Fi network and access your files, steal your information or even manipulate your entire network. And this is not just a theory - there have been many documented cases of people exploiting this vulnerability to hack into home networks.

The issue with using default passwords is that they are widely known among cyber criminals, making your network an easy target for attacks. Default passwords are often set by the manufacturers for the convenience of the users, but they are rarely changed. Hackers take advantage of this and use pre-built tools to scan for routers with default passwords and gain access to the network.

But the good news is, it's relatively easy to fix the issue. You just need to change the password to something stronger and unique. A strong password should be at least eight characters long, include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Also, avoid using words or phrases that are easy to guess, such as your name, birth date or any sequential series.

To change the password for your Linksys E4200 router, go to the router's login page and enter your current password "admin." Then, navigate to the "Wireless" or "Security" settings and choose a new password. Make sure to save the changes and log out of the router's admin page.

In summary, securing your internet connection is important to protect your data and privacy. Using default passwords is a significant security threat, and you should never rely on them for network security. Take action now and change the default password to something strong and unique to protect your home network from potential cyber attacks.

The default password for the Linksys E4200 router is admin; this password is case sensitive. The E4200 doesn't have a default username. There is, however, a default IP address: 192.168.1.1â€”this is how you connect to the router to log in.

 
##   When the E4200 Default Password Doesn't Work  
 

If the default admin password doesn't work, the password may have been changed to something more secure. If you don't know the new password, a reset will bring the router back to its factory default settings so that the default password works.

 
The Linksys E4200v2 is sold and marketed as a different router than the E4200, and is an upgraded version of the same device. The default password is the same for both routers, but v2 has a username of admin.
 

Here's how to reset the E4200 router:

 
- Plug in the router and turn on the power. Look for a light on the router that indicates the power is on. It may be near the network cable or on the front of the device.
 - Flip the router over so that you have access to the bottom.
 - With something small and pointed (like a paperclip), press and hold the Reset button for 5 to 10 seconds. Release the Reset button when the port lights flash at the same time. The Ethernet port lights are on the back of the router.
 - Wait at least 30 seconds for the device to reset, then unplug the power cable for a few seconds.
 - Plug the power cable back in and wait at least 30 seconds for the router to boot up fully.
 - When the E4200 is reset, access the router at http://192.168.1.1 with the default username and password.

 

Resetting the E4200 resets the username and password and also any custom settings you configured. For example, if you set up a wireless network before you reset the router, re-enter that information, including the SSID and wireless password.

Change the router's default password to something secure and difficult to remember. A password manager will help you retrieve it if you need to reset the router again.
 
##   When You Can't Access the E4200 Router  
 

If no changes have been made to the IP address of the E4200, you should be able to access the router at the default address (http://192.168.1.1). If it has been changed, however, you don't need to reset the router or do anything drastic to see what its current IP address is.

 
Back up custom settings to a file and use this file to restore them at once if you need to reset the router in the future. It's done through the Administration > Management menu of the router. You'll find screenshots to use for reference on page 61 of the user manual, which is linked at the bottom of this page.
 

Instead, find what the default gateway is set up as on a computer that's connected to the router. This IP address is the same as the router's address. In Windows, find your default gateway IP address. In macOS, open System Preferences > Network > TCP/IP.
