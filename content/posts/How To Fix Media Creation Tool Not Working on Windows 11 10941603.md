If you have ever tried to install Windows 11 on your computer using the Media Creation Tool, you might have faced some errors that caused the installation process to fail. These errors can be frustrating and time-consuming, and they might even prevent you from upgrading to the latest version of Windows.

The good news is that there is a fix that can help you avoid these errors and install Windows 11 like a pro. In this article, we will show you how to use this fix and get Windows 11 up and running on your computer in no time.

The Fix

The fix involves using a tool called Rufus, which is a free and open-source application that allows you to create bootable USB drives for Windows and other operating systems. The advantage of using Rufus over the Media Creation Tool is that it is more reliable and less prone to errors.

Here are the steps you need to follow to use Rufus and install Windows 11 on your computer:

Step 1: Download Rufus

The first step is to download Rufus from the official website. Rufus is a small application that is easy to install, and it works on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows.

Step 2: Download the Windows 11 ISO

Next, you need to download the Windows 11 ISO file from the Microsoft website. You can find the ISO file by searching for "Windows 11 download" on Google or by going to the Microsoft website directly.

Step 3: Create a Bootable USB Drive

Once you have downloaded Rufus and the Windows 11 ISO, you need to create a bootable USB drive. To do this, insert a USB drive into your computer and open Rufus. In Rufus, select the USB drive you want to use, then select the Windows 11 ISO file you downloaded earlier.

Make sure that the partition scheme is set to "MBR" and the file system is set to "FAT32". Then, click on "Start" to create the bootable USB drive.

Step 4: Boot from the USB Drive

Once you have created the bootable USB drive, you need to boot from it to install Windows 11. To do this, restart your computer and press the key to access the Boot menu (usually F12 or Del). Select the USB drive from the list of boot devices and press Enter.

Step 5: Install Windows 11

Finally, follow the instructions on the screen to install Windows 11 on your computer. The installation process should be smooth and error-free, and you should be able to enjoy all the new features and improvements that Windows 11 has to offer.
