## Chosen Solution
 need a charger for G5 7.85

 You may need a high amp charger in the 2-3A range, as this is a larger device. Any MicroUSB cable will work, but oftentimes with tablets your phone charger does not cut it. Try and find a 3A one to be sure - it may be excessive, but the tablet will only draw what it needs and you can use it with high powered devices no problem. It doesnâ€™t say what it needs on the back (which some of these cheap Android tablets do), so I would assume 2-3A as the baseline.
Try and find a charger like this. Chargers last so long it makes sense to spend more on a good one, even for a low end tablet. The tablet will fail before a quality charger.
