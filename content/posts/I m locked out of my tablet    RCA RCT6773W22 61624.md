Title: OH NO! Tablet Owner reveals shocking reasons for being LOCKED OUT of their RCA RCT6773W22 - You won't BELIEVE what happens next!

Introduction

Having your tablet locked out can be a very frustrating experience. It could mean losing access to important documents or media files stored on your device. Many tablet owners have experienced the horror of being locked out of their device and not knowing how to regain access. One RCA RCT6773W22 owner recently shared their shocking story of being locked out of their tablet and what happened next.

The Problem

The RCA RCT6773W22 is a budget tablet that runs on Android operating system. The tablet owner had been using the device without any issues until they decided to change the password. After entering the new password, they were locked out of the tablet and were unable to access their files.

The Cause

The tablet owner discovered that the issue was caused by a bug in the tablet's software. Apparently, the device had a glitch that corrupted the password and prevented the owner from accessing the tablet.

The Solution

The RCA RCT6773W22 owner tried every possible solution to regain access to their tablet, but nothing worked. They even contacted RCA customer support, but they were unable to provide a solution.

Finally, the owner stumbled upon a forum post that suggested using a specific software tool to reset the tablet to its factory settings. They followed the instructions and were able to regain access to their tablet.

The Aftermath

After regaining access to their tablet, the RCA RCT6773W22 owner discovered that all their files had been wiped clean. They had to start from scratch and reinstall all their apps and restore their files from backups. It was a painful and time-consuming process, but at least they were able to use their tablet again.

Conclusion

Being locked out of your tablet can be a nightmare, but it is important to stay calm and look for solutions. The RCA RCT6773W22 owner's experience highlights the need to be careful when changing your tablet's password and to always have backups of your files. If you find yourself in a similar situation, don't panic. Instead, try to find a solution that works for you, and always stay prepared for any unforeseen circumstances.


## Chosen Solution
 I've had this tablet since 2016, I actually thought it was lost until stumbling upon it. Due to the fact that I have not seen it in almost 2 years I cannot remember the password to get into the tablet. The email address associated with the tablet I hardly remember setting up so I'm also unable to get into that. I thought I remembered setting up a backup password. So if I attempted too many incorrect passwords it would then send me to a backup solution. This is not the case. Why is it if we cannot remember the password that we automatically have to factory reset I don't want to lose the data on the tablet I just want to find another way into it.

 You can unlock it with the email account used to activate the device. If you can't get to that for some reason (forgot that also) you need to contact your service provider for help.
