Title: You won't believe what happened to this iPhone 6 Plus during charging port repair - Home button disaster!

Introduction:

iPhones have become an essential part of our lives. Whether it's for communication or entertainment, we depend on them for various purposes. However, like any electronic device, they can malfunction, and repairing them becomes necessary. In this article, we will explore an incident where an iPhone 6 Plus went through an unexpected malfunction during a charging port repair.

Body:

A few weeks ago, my colleague approached me with an iPhone 6 Plus. The charging port of the device was malfunctioning, and he wanted me to fix it. I had repaired several iPhones in the past, so I considered it an easy repair. I went ahead and started the repair process, which involved opening the device.

After opening the device, I realized that the job was a bit tricky, and I had to remove several different parts. I carefully took out the charging port to examine it closely. Fortunately, the charging port was the only malfunctioning part, and all other parts were working fine.

Once I had replaced the charging port, I started reassembling the device. Everything went well until I stumbled upon a new issue – the home button had stopped working. I tried to fix the home button, but it was to no avail. I had to disassemble the device again to diagnose the issue.

Upon opening the device, I realized that I had accidentally damaged the home button cable while removing the charging port. On further inspection, I discovered that the home button attachment was quite delicate and could easily break during the repairing process.

Unfortunately, the home button cable was damaged beyond repair due to the delicate attachment. I had two options to fix this issue – to buy a new home button module or take the device to an authorized Apple service center.

Conclusion:

Repairing an iPhone is not always easy, and it requires a lot of patience and attention to detail. Even with experience, some malfunctions can come as a surprise, and this incident proved the same. From this experience, I learned that it's important to be cautious and take extra care while dismantling and reassembling an iPhone. A small mistake can lead to several issues, impacting the overall functionality of the device. I hope this article will help others to be more careful during the iPhone repairing process.

## Chosen Solution
 I own a repair shop. Had a iPhone 6 plus charging port replacement. I could do these in my sleep… 

I turned off the phone and unplugged the battery from logic board and proceeded to do the repair and undo the screws, loud speaker all that stuff comes out. I drop the new part in and put everything back perfect. Test the port and headphone jack and everything works. I Call customer that her phone’s ready and that’s it…..

Only it was not it…

Customer comes in to pickup phone and only then I notice the home button does not work. 
I grab a new home button from back stock and replace it and it still wont work. I call apple support and the tech says it is most likely software  related. so I back up the customer’s data to iCloud and then I wipe it clean, reload everything back in and… 

Home button was still dead

I had to compensate the customer for the botched repair job… I did not use any metal tools disconnecting any connections, as power can still be loaded on the logic board even when it’s battery is unplugged, I used a plastic tool for the repair and only used a metal pry tool to start to open the phone and the screwdriver. I have no Idea why the home button wont work or how I broke it.  

I figured I would ask someone more knowledgeable then me because I cannot have this happen again at my shop. 

Thoughts ?

 Tried another home button  extension cable metal plate? It may have just gone bad for whatever reason.
