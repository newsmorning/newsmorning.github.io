Title: Breaking News: I Accidentally Overpowered My Bread Maker to 240W - See How I Saved It from Total Destruction!

Have you ever encountered a kitchen disaster? Well, I have, and it was a horrifying experience. I almost destroyed my bread maker by overpowering it with 240W of electricity by mistake. It was an upsetting situation, but luckily, I managed to save it. In this article, I will share my story and the steps I took to rescue my bread maker from total destruction.

To begin with, I had just returned from shopping with a new set of cooking appliances, including my bread maker. As excited as I was to use it for the first time, I overlooked the fine prints and plugged it to an outlet that couldn't handle its power requirements. It was a foolish mistake that almost cost me my bread maker.

As soon as I pressed the "Start" button, the machine began to make an unusual noise that got me worried. The bread maker even started to emit smoke and heat. I quickly unplugged it from the power outlet and waited for it to cool down. I was upset because I had spent a lot of money on the appliance, and now it was damaged.

But, I didn't give up as I always believed that there is a way out of every problem. I did my research and found out that my bread maker had a built-in safety mechanism that could prevent it from self-destructing. The safety feature cut out the power supply as a result of the electrical surge, which saved the machine from exploding.

So, I took the following steps to ensure the safety of my bread maker:

Step 1: Disconnected the Bread Maker from Power Supply

The first thing I did was to disconnect the bread maker from the power supply. This step is essential because it could prevent further damage to the bread maker and ensure your safety.

Step 2: Checked the Accessory

After disconnecting the bread maker, the next step was to check the accessory. I opened the bread maker's lid and checked the accessory for any signs of damage. Luckily, nothing was wrong with the accessory.

Step 3: Waited for the Bread Maker to Cool Down

It takes time for an electrical appliance to cool down after overheating. So, I unplugged the bread maker from the power outlet and waited for an hour to let it cool down completely.

Step 4: Plugged the Bread Maker Back to the Power Outlet

After waiting for an hour, I plugged the bread maker back to the power outlet. The bread maker work perfectly fine without any damages done to it.

In conclusion, it's imperative to read the instructions carefully before using any electrical appliance. In my case, I overlooked the information and ended up overpowering my bread maker. Thankfully, my bread maker was saved by its inbuilt safety mechanism. As long as you follow the steps I took, you can have a similar outcome when facing similar situations. Finally, always remember that prevention is better than cure, and it's crucial to stay safe while using electrical appliances.


## Chosen Solution
 I pugged it to 240w instead of 120w

 @tirusha, T nawarathna , The bread maker will have to be taken apart to see extent of damage and the circuitry tested, it may be repairable. If not familiar/comfortable working with electronics, have a good local small electronics repair shop take a look, diagnose and estimate repair.  Good luck. I hope this helped you out, if so let me know by pressing the helpful button.
