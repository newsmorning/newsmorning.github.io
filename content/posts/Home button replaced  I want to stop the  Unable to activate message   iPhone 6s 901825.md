# Stop the Frustration Now! Say Goodbye to iPhone 6S 'Unable to Activate' Message After Replacing Home Button!

The iPhone 6S is a fantastic smartphone, but over time, the home button can start to malfunction. This can be frustrating, as it can impact the device's overall functionality. If you have recently replaced your iPhone 6S home button, you may have encountered an issue where your device displays the 'Unable to Activate' message. This can be incredibly frustrating, as it can prevent you from being able to use your device. The good news is that there are solutions that can help you resolve this issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The 'Unable to Activate' message is usually displayed when there is an issue with the activation process. When you replace the home button on your iPhone 6S, it can cause the device to become unresponsive, resulting in a message to display on the screen. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, such as a damaged home button or a software issue.

## Solution 1: Reset Your iPhone

The first solution to try is to reset your iPhone. This involves holding down the Home and Power buttons together until the device restarts. This can help to resolve any software issues that may be causing the 'Unable to Activate' message to display. Once your device has restarted, try activating it again.

## Solution 2: Check for Software Updates

If resetting your iPhone did not resolve the issue, the next step is to check for software updates. In many cases, software issues can cause your iPhone to display the 'Unable to Activate' message. To check for updates, go to Settings > General > Software Update. If there is an update available, download and install it on your device.

## Solution 3: Contact Apple Support

If neither of the above solutions work, it may be necessary to contact Apple support. There may be a hardware issue that is causing your iPhone to display the 'Unable to Activate' message. Apple support can help you diagnose and resolve the issue, either by providing instructions on how to fix it or by arranging for your device to be repaired or replaced.

## Conclusion

Replacing a malfunctioning home button on your iPhone 6S can be a great way to restore the functionality of your device. However, if you encounter the 'Unable to Activate' message, it can prevent you from being able to use your iPhone. Thankfully, there are solutions that can help you resolve this issue. By resetting your device, checking for software updates, or contacting Apple support, you can say goodbye to the frustration of the 'Unable to Activate' message and start using your iPhone again.

 Home button has been  replaced-but  i want to stop the "Unable to activate touch ID on this iphone" from popping up all the time...is there a way to stop this message?

 It's not possible to stop the message unless you restore Touch ID by using the original home button again if it's still working or by taking it to Apple
