## Chosen Solution
 I have a HP ProBook 6440b that won’t turn on. The charger LED blinks but the laptop will not turn on with or without the battery. I’m sure the battery is completely dead, but I don’t think that would prevent it from powering on. Does anyone know how to fix this?

 Take out the battery, unplug the power adapter and press and hold the power button for 30 seconds.
Release and plug in the power adapter, only.  Does it work now?  “Yes” then a dead battery - replace.
Dead or almost dead batteries can cause problems.
For reference:
