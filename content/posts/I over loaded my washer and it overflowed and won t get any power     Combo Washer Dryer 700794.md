Title: The Aftermath of Overloading a Combo Washer Dryer

Introduction:
I had been putting off the laundry for days, and by the time I finally got around to it, I had a massive pile of clothes. I decided to save time and money by using my combo washer dryer. However, what happened next was a total disaster that left me in disbelief.

Body:
I loaded up the washer with a huge pile of clothes, filled the detergent compartment to the brim, and set the cycle to the maximum time. I thought I had everything under control. Little did I know that I was about to experience a laundry nightmare.

As the cycle began, I noticed the machine struggling to handle the load. The drum was moving at a sluggish pace, and the water didn't seem to be fully circulating. I figured this was just how the combo washer dryer functioned and didn't pay much heed to it.

After about an hour, the cycle had ended, and it was time for the dryer. I added some fabric conditioner to the load and set the dryer cycle. Within minutes, I knew something was amiss. The machine began to vibrate uncontrollably, and an ominous banging noise could be heard.

To my horror, the drum had become dislodged from its axis and was banging against the washer's outer casing. I immediately hit the stop button, but the damage had already been done. The clothes were soaked, twisted, and tangled beyond recognition. The washer dryer was completely unusable.

I tried to salvage what I could but ended up discarding most of the clothes. Additionally, I had to call a repair technician to fix the combo washer dryer, which cost me a fortune. All in all, it was a total disaster that could have been easily avoided.

Conclusion:
Overloading a combo washer dryer is the easiest mistake to make but the hardest to rectify. The moral of the story is always to follow the machine's recommended load capacities and cycle times to avoid such mishaps. Though it seemed like an easy fix, it ended up costing me a lot of money and inconvenience. It was a costly lesson that I had to learn the hard way.

## Chosen Solution
 I stuffed a huge blanket in the washer and I guess it made the water overflow. There’s  water on the floor but not that much. But the power is out on the unit completely. The washer and the dryer. I tried resetting the electricity breaker switches for the laundry room but still nothing. I don’t know what else to do…

 Hi
What is the make and model number of the washer / dryer combo unit?
Did it trip the breakers or did you just reset them both (turn off /  turn on)?
It may be that the water caused an electrical problem with the washer /  dryer’s control board.
With the power totally disconnected from the washer, open up the washers control panel and check for any obvious damage to the control board e.g. burn marks, blown components etc.
If you spot any damage (or even if you don’t) and are not quite sure, take some close up pictures of the board and post back here.
Here’s how to do this.

 Are these connected to a GFCI Outlet? These are the ones that have the two little buttons on the wall outlet. These are often installed in areas around water such as kitchens and bathrooms. These are designed to work like a breaker but at the outlet level. If you see two little buttons try and press the one that says reset.
