## Chosen Solution
 Hello. I think Netflix must have recently updated their app and moved some buttons around because now some of the menu buttons are at the bottom of the screen. The problem is that my tablet is permanently displaying the home and back buttons in the app so I can’t get to the Netflix menu buttons. For example I try to press Downloads but the home button is over the top so it just clears the app. I tried swiping down to see if it would remove the tablet buttons but they don't clear and I can’t get anywhere on the Netflix app. Any ideas? Is there a way to rollback the app to a previous version or to change a setting so that the home button isn’t permanently in the way?

 Allow you tablet to rotate the screen. If the home button is in the way when you are holding your tablet horizontal, rotate it 90 degrees so that the screen is vertical. This should allow you to access these buttons on the Netflix app. You may have to go into your settings to allow for the screen to rotate.
