Unlock the Secret to Fix Your iPhone 7 PCB in Just 3 Easy Steps with Expert Advice!

If you are an iPhone 7 user looking to fix your iPhone’s PCB, you’ve come to the right place. Whether you’ve dropped your phone, spilled water on it, or it just stopped working suddenly, fixing the PCB can seem daunting. There are many guides out there that claim to help you fix your iPhone 7 PCB, but not all of them are reliable. That’s where this guide comes in. We will provide you with expert advice to help you unlock the secret to fix your iPhone 7 PCB in just 3 easy steps.

Step 1: Diagnose the Problem

Before you begin attempting to fix your iPhone’s PCB, it’s important to diagnose the problem with your device. There are several ways you can do this. One method is to use the iPhone’s built-in diagnostics test. This test will help you identify any hardware issues with your iPhone. To access this test, follow these steps:

1. Open the phone app and dial *3001#12345#*.

2. Press Call.

3. The diagnostics screen will appear.

4. Click on the “Cellular” tab and then “LTE”.

5. Click on “Serving Cell Info”.

6. The information displayed will help you identify potential issues with your iPhone’s hardware components.

Step 2: Fix the Problem

Once you have identified the problem with your iPhone’s PCB, you can begin to fix it. There are several ways to fix a PCB, but we recommend the use of professional tools and supplies. One of the most popular tools for fixing a PCB is a heat gun. A heat gun can be used to remove any damaged components on the PCB. For example, if your device is not turning on, the issue may be a damaged capacitor or resistor. A heat gun can be used to remove and replace these components.

Step 3: Test the Repair

Once you have fixed your iPhone’s PCB, it’s important to test the repair to ensure it’s working properly. There are several things you should do to test the repair. First, turn on your iPhone and make sure it’s working properly. Second, check to see if any of the hardware components that were previously not working, are now working. Third, ensure that all of the touch features on your iPhone’s display are working.

In conclusion, fixing your iPhone’s PCB can seem challenging, but with expert advice, it can be done in just three easy steps. First, diagnose the problem. Second, fix the problem using professional tools and supplies. Finally, test the repair to ensure it’s working properly. Remember, if you’re not confident in your ability to fix your iPhone’s PCB, it’s always best to seek professional help. With these tips, you can fix your iPhone’s PCB and get back to using your device in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
Question for someone a little more on the micro soldering / PCB repair side of things.
Re iPhone 7 (intel) - Attached photo of my measurements and notes.
Phone stuck in boot loop, not charging, not registering in itunes. Getting into repairs so trying to fix it but finding it a bit difficult to wrap my head around. Getting there thou.
Tried so many things, took diode measurements for J4502 and other parts. Went through PCB to try and find a short of a fault somewhere, no luck.
I did notice some strange readings on J4502 pin 24,26, 30, 32, 36, 38. Got double the reading I should of got up in the 800, supposed to be 485 for all.
This led me down the line on the iPhone schematics chart to L3901, L3902 and L3903. All those had way high readings in diode mode so does that mean they are all fried??
Will they lead a phone to boot-loop and not charge?
What other pins should I check that would relate to a phone behaving like this?  Would it lead me to find the culprit which is responsible for this happening?
Is there a way I could test the AUDIO IC with a multi-meter to find out if it is responsible?
Or could it be the base band pmu? all the capacitors around it seem to be good when measured in diode mode.
Any advice from someone experienced would be greatly appreciated.
I am learning so much on this phone and am confident of finding the solution with a little help and guidance

P.S Just noticed C1403 is measuring only 0.04v. Thats too much resistance right? way too low. shouldnt it me about 0.350 - 0.450v? Please correct me if I’m wrong

 It is hard to diagnose this problem over the internet.
·         Have you ruled out parts by putting it into a known good housing with good battery?
·         Are you using your multimeter correctly?
·          Red probe on ground?
·         What is the history of the phone?
·         Has it had an audio IC repair done?
·         Have you put it in DFU mode and tried a restore or recovery?
·         How much current is it drawing on prompt to boot?
