# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Replace Your 2012 BMW 3 Series Windshield Wipers with This Simple Guide!

Windshield wipers are one of the essential components of a vehicle. They play a critical role in keeping the windscreen free from rain, sleet, and snow. Over time, the rubber blade of windshield wipers becomes worn out, and it results in leaving streaks and blurred vision on the windshield. Replacing wipers regularly ensures you get a clear view of the road ahead. Here's a simple guide on how to replace your 2012 BMW 3 Series windshield wipers.

## Step 1: Choose the Right Wiper Blades

The BMW 3 Series uses a different size of wiper blades for the driver and passenger side. It is crucial to check the wiper blade size before purchasing new ones. You can find the correct size of the wiper blades in the owner's manual or by measuring the length of the existing wiper blades. Online retailers and auto parts stores have a tool that helps you find the right size of wiper blades for your vehicle.

## Step 2: Remove the Old Wiper Blades

With the wiper arm in the extended position, lift the wiper blade away from the windshield. Locate the release tab on the wiper blade. Depress the tab, and then slide the blade off the hook. Be careful not to let the wiper arm hit the windshield as it may cause a crack or chip.

## Step 3: Install the New Wiper Blades

Line up the new wiper blade with the hook on the wiper arm. Slide the new blade onto the hook until you hear it click into place. Gently lower the wiper arm back onto the windshield to ensure it secures the new blade.

## Step 4: Test the New Wiper Blades

Turn on your BMW 3 Series ignition and engage the windshield wiper switch. Observe the wiper blades to make sure they are functioning correctly. Run them for a few minutes to ensure they have a clean sweep and leave no streaks on the windshield.

## Conclusion:

Replacing windshield wipers is a straightforward task that you can complete in a few minutes. By following these simple steps and using the right wiper blades, you can ensure that you have a clear view of the road ahead. Worn-out windshield wipers can lead to a dangerous driving experience, and it's essential to replace them regularly. Don't wait until it's too late â€“ replace your 2012 BMW 3 Series wiper blades today.
