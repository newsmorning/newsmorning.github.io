In addition, it automatically updates all drivers and software to provide the best possible gaming experience. Unfortunately, things can go awry, and users may experience game detection issues while using the application. This problem, however, is not uncommon, and it can be fixed with the following five foolproof methods.\nMethod 1: Restart the GeForce Experience\nLike most software applications, GeForce Experience can experience glitches that may cause it to malfunction. A restart may be all that’s needed to fix the issue. Click the Windows button on your keyboard, search for the GeForce Experience app, right-click on it, and select “Quit.” Once the application is closed, restart it and check to see if the game detection issue has been resolved.\nMethod 2: Update your Graphics Card Driver\nAn outdated or faulty graphics card driver may be the reason why GeForce Experience is facing issues detecting some games. To update your driver, go to the NVIDIA website, and select your graphics card model. Locate the drivers section and download the newest available driver. Install the driver and restart your system, then launch GeForce Experience and check to see if it detects your games.\nMethod 3: Resetting the NVIDIA Services\nSometimes, NVIDIA services running in the background may experience errors that interfere with GeForce Experience. To check this, press the Windows button and R simultaneously. Type in “services.msc” in the run dialog, then hit Enter. Locate the NVIDIA Telemetry Container service and right-click on it, then select Stop. Locate the NVIDIA Network Service Container service underneath and right-click on it, and select Stop. After completing that, wait a few seconds, then right-click both services and choose Start. Restart the GeForce Experience application afterward and confirm that the game detection issue is resolved.\nMethod 4: Reinstall the GeForce Experience Application\nSuppose none of the first three methods, including restarting GeForce, updating the graphics card driver, or resetting NVIDIA services, have been successful. In that case, it’s time to reinstall the application. Go to the Windows Control Panel, click on “App and Features,” locate “GeForce Experience,” then click on “Uninstall.” Once the program has been deleted, go to the official NVIDIA website and download the latest version of GeForce Experience. The issue should be resolved after the app has been installed and restarted.\nMethod 5: Check the Game File Integrity\nHave you ever considered the possibility that the game files might be corrupt? Faulty game files can be insignificant, causing issues with GeForce Experience’s game detection. Go to your Steam account, right-click on the game, then click on “Properties.” Locate the “Local Files” tab, then click on “Verify Integrity of Game Files.” This may take a few minutes, so wait until it’s finished and retry launching the game through the GeForce Experience application.\nIn conclusion, GeForce Experience is an incredible tool that simplifies the gaming experience. Nevertheless, issues with game detection may arise, which can be resolved using various methods outlined above. By following these five foolproof methods, the game detection issue should be fixed, and you can continue enjoying your gaming experience with ease.\nGeForce Experience is a powerful software that works great with the GeForce GTX gaming graphic card series.
