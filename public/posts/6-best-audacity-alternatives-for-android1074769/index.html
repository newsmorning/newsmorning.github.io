Say goodbye to Audacity and explore the superior sound editing methods and features in these Android alternatives. Choose the one that suits your expertise level and budget to enjoy your sound editing process better.\nAudacity is a popular, free and powerful audio editing software that’s been available for years. The app lets you easily import, mix, and combine audio files.\nHowever, Audacity is not available for Android users. Not only that, but edits you make are mostly destructive, meaning they are written permanently to the original audio file so it’s impossible to recover after making mistakes. It’s no wonder that Audacity is the go-to choice for people who just want quick-and-dirty audio work.\nIf you’re looking to record music, start a podcast, or you’re an aspiring YouTuber and you want to upload your first video, you’ll need an audio editing app for Android.\nHere’s a roundup of the capable Audacity alternatives for Android to help you do all your basic and advanced editing on the go.\nBest Audacity Alternatives for Android 1. WavePad WavePad is a free and fully-featured Audacity for Android alternative with professional audio editing capabilities. The app supports a wide range of effects, bookmarking, batch processing, compression, Audio Unit plugins, scrubbing, and spectral analysis.\nYou can create and edit sound recordings including music and voice, duplicate sections of recordings and add echo or effects like noise reduction and amplification.\nWavePad has a simple user interface, and allows you to share your final edited audio with family or friends.\nPlus, the app brings features like a voice changer and text-to-speech (speech synthesis), which is ideal if you’re working on audio that requires use of multiple voice types. Video editors can also edit the audio in their videos in WavePad without separating audio from the video first using a different tool.\nThe app is free for personal use, but you can purchase the premium version if you want to use it for commercial purposes.\n2. MixPad MixPad is a free, easy-to-use mixer studio with professional recording and mixing features you can use to create your music, mix songs, or record podcasts on the go.\nThe app works like a digital mixing desk where you can mix your own music, vocal and audio tracks, pan, fade, and adjust volume.\nLike Audacity, MixPad is loaded with audio effects including reverb, compression, and EQ, plus royalty-free sound effects and a music library with lots of clips you can use in your productions.\nYou can mix an unlimited number of vocal, music, and audio tracks, save to popular file formats like MP3, split, trim, and copy tracks. The app supports sample rates from 6 kHz to 96 kHz, and ASIO for sample accurate recording.\nPlus, you can use the Beat Designer to craft your own beats, export all popular bit depths, and upload to cloud storage like Google Drive, Dropbox, and SoundCloud.\n3. Music Maker Jam Music Maker Jam is a simple beat maker app that’s easy to use no matter what level you’re at as a music creator. The app lets you create or remix beats or tracks for any music genre, so you can unleash your musical skills and creativity.\nAmong its powerful features include more than 300 mix packs with over 500,000 loops to make your own style of music, and the ability to record your tracks on the 8-channel mixer.\nYou can also arrange song parts, change harmonies and tempo, or play around with real-time effects like delay, stutter, or reverb. You can also remix tracks by shaking your Android device, record and mix your vocals into your beats, and share songs on social media networks like Facebook, YouTube, SoundCloud or TikTok.\n4. Lexis Audio Editor If you just want to fly through some audio editing or mixing tasks, the Lexis Audio Editor is worth considering. While the app isn’t as powerful as Audacity or other alternatives listed here, it’ll still get the job done when you want to splice something quickly before saving or sharing it with others.\nSome of the basic functions you’ll find in the app include a recorder, player, cut, copy, paste, delete, trim, insert silence, fade in, fade out, noise reduction, and normalizing. You can also record or import an audio file into an existing file, change speed, tempo, or pitch, and mix the current file with a different file.\nThe app supports regular audio formats like MP3, flac, aac, m4a, wma, and wav, as well as video formats like MP4, 3g2 and 3gp. A trial version is available with all features except saving in MP3, which you can only access in the paid version.\n5. Music Editor The Music Editor app is a free Audacity alternative for Android with a feature-filled audio editor.\nYou can merge two songs into one, adjust volume levels, compress audio by changing bit rate, sample rate, and the channel. Plus, you can cut out certain parts of music and set it as your device’s alarm tone, ringtone, or notification tone.\nThe app also lets you convert your music to different formats such as AAC to MP3, MP3 to WAV, or M4A to MP3 and so on. If you need to split audio into two parts, there’s a split audio feature for that, and all your processed files will be displayed under the My Creations section.\nWith Music Editor, you can mute part of the audio, edit audio speed to fast forward or slow it down, reverse the audio to play it in reverse, and edit metatags such as album, title, year, composer, and cover.\n6. Audio MP3 Cutter Mix Converter and Ringtone Maker The Audio MP3 Cutter Mix Converter and Ringtone Maker is a powerful and complete app with the features you need in an audio editor.\nWith the app, you can trim, mix, or merge audio files, change metadata fields like music album name or art cover, and convert from one format to another.\nYou can also set trimmed audio as a ringtone, alarm or notification tone, create remixes using two songs in the same or different format, adjust volume in your mashups, and access your music creations easily.\nThe app also lets you record voice or music, and then share your creations on social platforms including Facebook, or WhatsApp. The app doesn’t have an audio compressor, and it’s ad-supported.\nRecord, Edit, and Share Audio on the Go Every Audacity alternative for Android we’ve chosen here has a full set of basic editing controls, which is the life of audio manipulation. You should be able to use any of these six apps to make simple edits, but your final decision will depend on the task at hand and your level of expertise.\nWhat’s your favorite Audacity alternative for Android?
