Introduction:

With the widespread use of the internet and the growing dependence on digital technology, the importance of maintaining secure networks is more critical than ever. One common point of entry for cyber-attacks is through a compromised router, which hackers can exploit to gain access to a device and access sensitive information. In this article, we will discuss how to secure your Linksys E1200 router and avoid the dangers of default password hackers.

Section 1: Understanding the Risks

Before diving into how you can protect your Linksys E1200 router from hackers, it's essential to understand lurking risks posed by default passwords. It's a common practice for routers to come with passwords that are relatively easy to guess or are publicly available online. These default passwords can provide entry points for hackers who recognize the weakness and use it to compromise your router.

Once a hacker gains access to your router, they can monitor, intercept, and manipulate all the data that flows through it. This is particularly dangerous when you're exchanging sensitive information, such as banking information or personal identification data. With this knowledge, let's discuss how you can secure your Linksys E1200 router.

Section 2: Securing your Linksys E1200 Router

The first step to securing your router is to change the default password provided with the device. The Linksys E1200 comes with a default password that is easy to find on the internet. Therefore, the first thing you must do is replace the password with a strong, unique one that isn't available in any list of commonly used passwords.

When creating your password, ensure that it has a mixture of lower and upper case letters, numbers, and symbols. These elements will make your password more challenging to guess, and your network will be less vulnerable to attacks.

Another critical step in securing your router is to change the default SSID (Service Set Identifier). This is the name that you see when searching for available networks on your device. By changing the name, you hide it from the hackers' radar, making it less likely for them to locate and exploit your network.

You can also protect your network against unauthorized access by enabling WPA2 encryption. This encryption method is more robust than WEP, which is a common form of encryption that is easily cracked by hackers. With WPA2, your router password is combined with an encryption key that makes it difficult for hackers to crack it with brute force.

Section 3: Regular Maintenance

While changing your password and enabling encryption goes a long way in protecting your router, it's essential to continually monitor and update your router's firmware. Manufacturers release firmware updates to address any vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit. Keeping your router up-to-date with the latest firmware ensures that your network remains secure.

Conclusion:

Maintaining secure networks is critical in the digital era, and routers play a significant role in protecting our devices and data from cyber-attacks. We've discussed how hackers can use default passwords to gain access to your router and the steps you can take to secure your Linksys E1200 router. Remember to change the default password, change the SSID, enable WPA2 encryption, and update the firmware regularly. Be diligent in securing your router; it could save you a great deal of trouble in the long run.

The Linksys E1200 default password is admin. As with other passwords, the password for this router is case sensitive, which in this scenario means uppercase letters can't be used. When you're asked for the default username, enter admin also. A common default IP address for Linksys routers is 192.168.1.1, and that's also the case for this one.

 
##   What to Do if the Linksys (Cisco) E1200 Default Password Doesn't Work  
 

If the default password doesn't work, it means it's been changed to something else. When you don't know the password and have no way to find out what it is, reset the router to its factory default settings to restore all the default information.

 
There are four hardware versions of the E1200 router (1.0, 2.0, 2.2, and 2.3), and each one uses the same username and password.
 
If you see this router called E1200 N300 on Linksys' website, know that it's talking about the same router described on this page.
 

Here's how to reset the Linksys E1200 router:

 
- Plug in and power on the router.
 - Flip the router over so you have access to the bottom.
 - With a small and sharp object such as a paperclip or pin, press and hold the Reset button for 5 to 10 seconds.
 - Flip the router back over to its normal position, then wait 30 seconds for it to fully reset.
 - Unplug the power cable for a few seconds and plug it back in.
 - Wait 30 seconds or so for the device to power on.
 - After the reset, log in with the default username and password of admin. Use http://192.168.1.1 to access the router.
 - Change the router password to something complex, not the easy-to-guess password of admin.

 

Resetting a router means all the settings are deleted and restored to the original factory defaults; this is how the router was set up right out of the box. After the reset, enter the customizations you made prior, such as wireless network settings (for example, the SSID and wireless password), DNS server settings, and port forwarding options.

 

Plug in and power on the router.

 

Flip the router over so you have access to the bottom.

 

With a small and sharp object such as a paperclip or pin, press and hold the Reset button for 5 to 10 seconds.

 

Flip the router back over to its normal position, then wait 30 seconds for it to fully reset.

 

Unplug the power cable for a few seconds and plug it back in.

 

Wait 30 seconds or so for the device to power on.

 

After the reset, log in with the default username and password of admin. Use http://192.168.1.1 to access the router.

 

Change the router password to something complex, not the easy-to-guess password of admin.

 

To avoid having to enter the information again after a reset, you can back up the router configuration to a file. There's information on doing this in the product manual linked below.

 
##   Help! I Canâ€™t Access My E1200 Router  
 

The default IP address for the Linksys E1200 router makes the URL for accessing the router http://192.168.1.1. However, if you can't reach the router with that address, it means it's been changed to something else.

 

Unlike having to reset the router to get the default password restored, you can see what the default gateway is configured as on a computer connected to the router. That IP address is the same as the router's IP address.

 
##   Linksys E1200 Manual & Firmware Links
