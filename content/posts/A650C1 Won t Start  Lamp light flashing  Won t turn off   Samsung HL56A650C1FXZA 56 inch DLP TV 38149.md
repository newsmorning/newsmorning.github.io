Title: Is Your Samsung 56 Inch DLP TV Dead? Learn How to Fix the A650C1 Won't Start & End the Endless Lamp Light Flashing!

Introduction:
If you own a Samsung 56 Inch DLP TV and it won't start, or worse, the lamp light keeps flashing endlessly, then you might feel like your TV is dead. But fear not, as there are ways to fix this issue and bring your favorite TV back to life. So, let's dive into the common reasons behind this problem and learn how we can solve it.

Body:
1. Check the Lamp:
The first thing you should do is check the lamp of your Samsung 56 Inch DLP TV. This is often the main culprit behind the won't start or endless lamp light flashing issue. The lamp usually lasts about 6000-8000 hours, so if your TV is older or has been used extensively, then it might be time for a replacement. You can purchase a new lamp that is compatible with your TV model and change it yourself. This is a relatively easy process and you don't need to be a professional to do it.

2. Check the Power Supply:
If the lamp is not the problem, then the issue might be with your TV's power supply. Make sure that your TV is properly plugged in and the outlet is working. If this is not the case, then it can indicate a faulty power supply board. You can consult a professional technician to fix this issue.

3. Check the Color Wheel:
Another common issue with Samsung DLP TVs is a broken color wheel. If you hear a loud buzzing sound coming from your TV, then it's likely that the color wheel is broken. You can replace the color wheel by yourself or with the help of a professional technician.

4. Check the Fan:
If your TV is overheating, then it might not start or the lamp light might keep flashing. The problem might be with the TV's fan. Check if the fan is working properly and clean the dust build-up around it. This might solve the issue. If not, then it's best to take the TV to a technician.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, owning a Samsung 56 Inch DLP TV does not mean the end of the world when it won't start, or the lamp light keeps flashing endlessly. There are ways to fix these issues and bring your TV back to life. You can check the lamp, power supply, color wheel, and fan to identify the problem. Once you identify the issue, you can either fix it on your own or consult a professional technician. So don't panic and follow the steps above, and you can ensure that your favorite TV will be working just as good as new in no time.


## Chosen Solution
 My question is about the 72" version of the same
TV Model HL72A650C1FXZA
TV Serial: AMBF3CKQB01234B
Version: OG01
Came into room while kids were watching TV, and the screen was frozen. Picture was clear. No sound. TV would not turn off by remote or front-pannel stand-by button. Had to pull the plug.
Plugged in and re-started, and the TV screen would not come on. Standby light comes on, then disapears when power button is pressed. Lamp light flashes constantly. TV will still not turn off by remote or front button. Onboard 'channel +/-', 'source', 'vol +/-' buttons do nothing.
Replaced the bulb with high quality one at the link below. TV has the same problems even with the new bulb, except that now when the TV turns on, the screen illuminates but stays a flat black/grey colour.
I am asking for advise on a way to test what components need to be replaced, or a suggestion on order of components to investigate, as I have little experience with this type of TV. Can anyone help or suggest the next step, as the next components seem to be $200 and up, and I don;t want to spend that kind of money without some level of confidence that it will help solve the problem.
Update 10/15/2016
Here is the lamp starting video. You hear the click, one ballast 'tick', and the lamp lights up.

 @actionman1 thank you for the video. That clarified  the lamp questions as well as the ballast. In that case I'd go back to the black screen with the lamp on is usually caused by a bad DMD board. I'd start there.
