Elden Ring has a lot of Bosses & hostile creatures. Some of them are easy to deal with while others feel like it takes a whole lifetime or two to defeat them. As such, we will need the best Gear & Skills to combat them. The 1.04 Update has buffed many Ashes of War in the game, one of them being the Lion’s Claw. The Lion’s Claw was a good Ashes of War before the update and has now become highly recommended for Strength & Dex Builds. In this guide, I will show you the location of the Lion’s Claw as well as the best Build for it in Elden Ring.
 
## Lion’s Claw Location in Elden Ring
 

 
To get the Lion’s Claw Ashes of War in Elden Ring, head to the Border between Limgrave & Caelid. From there head to the Southmost tip of the Border, that is where Fort Gael is located. Inside of Fort Gael will be a Lion Guardian. Defeat it and you will get the Lion’s Claw Ashes of War. Once you have it, you will now be able to dish out some heavy damage. It has a Heavy affinity that scales greatly with Strength. The affinity on it can be changed. Lion’s Claw can be applied on various weapons like Straight Swords, Greatswords, Colossal Swords, Curved Swords, Curved Greatswords, Katanas, Twinblades, Hammers, Great Hammers, Axes, Greataxes, Flails, & Colossal Weapons.
 
## Best Build with Lion’s Claw
 
Lion’s Claw has the potential to deal a lot of damage in a few hits. So, having a status effect will greatly benefit from it. As such, the best builds to use this would be Blood or Cold builds. Since the 1.04 patch, Bleed damage has taken a hit and is not as good as it used to be. So the best build I recommended to use with the Lion’s Claw in Elden Ring is:
 
- Mushroom Crown Helm – Found at the Southmost part of Lake of Rot on a corpse located on top of a Pillar.
 - Rotten Greataxe – Dropped by defeating the Rotten Duelist to the Northwest of Ordina, Liturgical Town.
 - Lion’s Claw Ashes of War – Set to either Cold or Poison affinity with their respective Whetblades.
 - Stats required – Strength, Dexterity, & Arcane. Then Vigor & Endurance.
 - Flask Of Wondrous Physick – Stonebarb Cracked Tear & Windy Crystal Tear
 - Talismans – Axe Talisman, Kindred Of Rot’s Exultation, Godfrey Icon, & Shard Of Alexander.

 
With the help of the Black Whetblade, you can apply the Poison affinity & with the Glintstone Whetblade, you can apply the Cold affinity. The Mushroom Crown Helm raises the attack power of the user when an enemy is affected by Rot or Poison. The Rotten Greataxe applies Scarlet Rot as a passive so combine that with the Poison affinity and you can proc a D.O.T. on your enemies. Cold affinity can also work here as it will let you deal more damage while slowing down the enemy.
 
### General tips for the Build
 
The build comes together when you successfully proc one of the statuses effects. The Lion’s Claw Ashes of War will dish out massive damage. The Rot & Poison will apply D.O.T. damage & the Helm will boost its power. The above Talismans will greatly assist the status effect as well as the Greataxe. For stats, prioritize Strength & Dexterity. After which put some points into Arcane & the rest into Vigor & Endurance. You can also have the Flask Of Wondrous Physick with Stonebarb Cracked Tear & Windy Crystal Tear.
