Title: Samsung Galaxy S8 Screen Broken! Find out how I accidentally hit my phone and now the top half won't respond to touch!

Introduction:
One moment, your Samsung Galaxy S8 is in impeccable condition, and the next minute, it falls off your hand or hits a hard surface. Accidents happen, and the result is a damaged phone that can significantly disrupt your daily routine. Unfortunately, I was one of those unlucky people who had to deal with a broken phone after an accidental hit. My Samsung Galaxy S8 screen broke, and the top half became unresponsive to touch. Here’s what happened and what I did to fix it.

Body:
It all started on a regular day when I was rushing to meet some deadlines. My phone’s battery was running low, and I decided to plug it in the charger while checking my work emails. However, my fingers were slippery, and my phone suddenly slipped from my grasp, hitting the edge of my desk on its way down. I picked it up, hoping it would still work, but to my horror, the top half of the screen stopped responding to touch.

At first, I thought it was just a minor glitch and restarted the phone, but the unresponsive area remained. I even tried to press down on the area to see if I could fix it, but nothing worked. Searching online for quick solutions, I learned that it was likely the result of a broken digitizer, a malfunction of the touch sensing component of the display.

I realized my Samsung Galaxy S8 needed professional repair, so I did some research and decided to book an appointment with a reliable phone repair shop. When I got there, the technicians diagnosed my phone and confirmed it needed a new screen replacement to fix the digitizer issue.

Within a few hours, I got it back, and it was like having a new phone. The repair was seamless, and the new screen relieved the frustration of dealing with an unresponsive phone. However, the situation taught me some lessons. First, I learned to be more careful and cautious when handling my phone. Secondly, I also realized the importance of having backup phones or alternative communication channels like email or desktop texting in case of a broken phone.

Conclusion:
A broken phone screen can be a nightmare, but accidents happen, and no matter how careful we are, the unexpected still occurs. As tempting as it is to try and fix it yourself, it’s often best to seek professional help, and I am grateful I did. With my Samsung Galaxy S8 screen fixed, it's back to excellent condition, and I can now continue with my work and personal errands without any disruptions. In conclusion, while it may seem like a hassle to have to deal with a broken phone, it’s always important to stay calm, assess the situation, and seek professional repair for the best possible outcome.

## Chosen Solution
 I was recently weight lifting when I was putting my weight bar down on my bed it accidentally fell a few inches and hit my phone, now it has a crack on it and it formed a horizontal line across my screen, I thought I might only be a cosmetic issue but it won’t recognize my finger taps above the line it formed. Anything I can do to fix it?

 The only thing you can do is replace the entire screen. It's damaged the digitizer and OLED screen. If you want to pay someone to replace it you are looking at 300 to 400 dollars. If you want to replace it you are looking at 250 to 300 dollars in parts.
