# Fortnite's Explosive Twist: Discover Which Game-Changing Weapons Have Been Vaulted in Season X!

Fortnite has always been a game that has kept on evolving. With every new season, players are introduced to new weapons, maps, and gameplay mechanics that add a fresh twist to the iconic battle royale game. But with the start of Season X, players were in for a shock as Epic Games decided to vault some of the most powerful and game-changing weapons from Fortnite's arsenal.

In case you're wondering what vaulting means, it's a term used by Epic Games to describe the act of removing items from the in-game loot pool. Vaulting allows Epic to shuffle its weapon lineup, so that they can introduce new weapons without completely breaking the balance of the game.

So, without further ado, let's delve into the weapons that have been vaulted in Season X and the implications that these changes have for your gameplay.

## Drum Gun

The first weapon on our list is the Drum Gun. This close and medium-range weapon was widely considered to be overpowered by many players, and its vaulting was a welcome change. The Drum Gun was far too versatile, and it had good damage output, which made it a popular choice in most in-game scenarios. This weapon's vaulting will add more variety to the game, and players will need to think more about the weapons they choose for their loadout.

## Baller

Next up, we have the Baller, one of the most controversial vehicles in the game. The Baller provided players with an unparalleled level of mobility, but it could also be used to block opponents' shots and make players difficult to hit. The Baller's vaulting means that players will be required to make more tactical decisions about their movement around the map.

## Quad Crasher

The Quad Crasher, another popular vehicle in the game, has also been vaulted. The Quad Crasher was a favorite of many players because of its speed and ability to break structures. However, many players felt that the Quad Crasher was overpowered and made it too easy to get around the map. The Quad Crasher's absence means that players will have to be more careful about moving around the map and choosing their routes strategically.

## Tactical Assault Rifle

The Tactical Assault Rifle was also vaulted in Season X. This weapon was a medium to short-range weapon with high accuracy and a high rate of fire. While it was not overpowered, the Tactical Assault Rifle was a versatile weapon that was very useful in many different scenarios. Its vaulting means that players will have to be more creative in their weapon selection and try new strategies.

## Conclusion:

Overall, the vaulting of weapons in Season X has changed the game's dynamics, and players will need to adjust their play styles accordingly. Epic Games' move towards more balanced gameplay means that players will have to take more care in weapon choice and think more strategically about their movements around the map. The changes have a positive impact on the game, keeping it fresh and unpredictable for players. So gear up, and get ready to explore what Season X has in store for you!
