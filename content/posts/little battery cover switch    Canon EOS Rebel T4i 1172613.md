# You'll Never Believe This Tiny Switch on the Canon Eos Rebel T4I Camera Could Save Your Life!

If you own a Canon EOS Rebel T4i camera or aspire to own one soon, there is a tiny switch on the camera you should never take for granted. This switch is the AEL/AFL button, and it can do more than just lock focus or exposure. In fact, it could save your life!

The AEL/AFL button stands for “Auto-Exposure Lock” or “Auto-Focus Lock” button. When you press this button, it locks the exposure or focus at the point where the camera is currently pointed. This allows you to reposition the camera to get a better view without losing the focus or exposure settings.

However, the AEL/AFL button can do more than that. If you are ever in a situation where you feel threatened or need to call for help, this tiny switch can be used as a panic button. All you need to do is program it to dial emergency services when pressed.

You can do this by using a feature called “Custom Functions,” which allows you to assign various functions to different buttons on the camera. To program the AEL/AFL button, go to the Menu, select Custom Functions, and then choose C.Fn IV: Operation/Others. Next, choose the “Assign SET button” and select “Call EMS” or “SOS Dial” from the options that appear.

Once you have programmed the AEL/AFL button, all you need to do in an emergency is press and hold the button for three seconds. The camera will then connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth and dial emergency services automatically. This can be a lifesaver in situations where you are unable to use your phone due to lack of signal or injury.

In addition to being a safety feature, the AEL/AFL button can also be used to capture stunning photographs. You can use it to lock exposure or focus on a particular subject, creating a more refined and organized composition.

In conclusion, the AEL/AFL button on the Canon EOS Rebel T4i camera could save your life in addition to being a great photography tool. Take advantage of this tiny switch by programming it to dial emergency services in case of an emergency. You never know when you might need it.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
my 650D could no longer turn on.
I found on the Internet a note that it could be the battery cover switch (little secure  switch when you open the battery-cover).  As I pressed the little switch with the screwdriver the eos turned on. :D
In the Internet I was supposed to bend the small switch with the screw in the middle. At the attempt the switch broked : /
Now my questions:
Can this switch or the board be replaced?
If so, what is the description of this board-part?
Can you simply bridge it? (I can solder)
I would like to unscrew the camera when I know more about it.
Thank you.
