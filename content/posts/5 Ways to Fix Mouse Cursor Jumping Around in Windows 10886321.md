When working on a Windows 10 device, the impossibility of adequately using your mouse, mainly when you depend on it, can seriously affect your productivity. And one annoying issue concerning mice is noticing that the cursor jumps randomly and is unresponsive to your moves.
 
## Fix your erratic mouse pointer with our step-by-step solutions below
 
- The mouse jumping around on a Windows 10 device might be a matter of a few settings.
 - Similarly, mouse skipping might not necessarily be connected to a hardware issue.
 - So instead of replacing your mouse on the spot, see if the device works on another PC.
 - Note that sometimes, the antivirus might interfere as well.

Even though your goal would be to resolve the cursor jumping problem with the device you already own, considering that the issue might be with the mouse itself would imply the need to invest in a new mouse. 
 
If you only have this option, you might as well invest in a mouse with multitasking capabilities to improve your overall productivity levels.
 
So in this troubleshooting article, we’ll approach some easy-to-follow ways to fix this problem. 
 
## Why does my mouse jump around Windows 10?
 
Every computer component has a dedicated driver that controls how it interacts with the operating system. It works the same way with mice for computers. 
 
This, like any other driver program, has the potential to get corrupted for a variety of different causes. Your mouse drivers will, at some point and eventually, go out of date, and they will need to be updated regularly. 
 
Another possibility is that because of how your system is configured, the mouse’s pointer on your screen may be erratic.
 
### Can jumping cursor be caused by a virus?
 
A mouse that acts erratically or even jumps about might be the result of a virus. In order to determine whether or not this is the case, you may run a virus scan with your antivirus software already installed on your computer.
 
Without further ado, let’s jump into the list of solutions to the laptop mouse jumping around issue in Windows 10.
 
## How can I fix the mouse if it’s jumping around on Windows 10?
 
### 1. Check for hardware issues
 
First, you need to check if there isn’t a hardware problem involved. Maybe you’ve already tried this, but it’s the first thing you should verify. So, connect your mouse to a different computer, if available.
 
Also, if you connect your mouse through a faulty USB port, try to use another USB socket and see if the problem persists from there. 
 
If everything works as it should, then there’s nothing wrong with the actual mouse; otherwise, replace the mouse, and the problem is solved.
 
In the same line with the hardware issue, this problem can also be caused by electrical interference. But, again, you can try unplugging all the USB devices from the PC and reconnecting them.
 
However, if you conclude that the mouse itself is responsible for this problem, check our list of the best PC mice that you can get right now.
 
### 2. Adjust touchpad delay time and disable touchpad
