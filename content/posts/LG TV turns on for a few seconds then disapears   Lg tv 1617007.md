If you own an LG TV, you might have experienced the frustrating problem of it disappearing after a few seconds. This issue can occur for several reasons, ranging from simple to complex. Fortunately, many of the solutions are quite easy to implement.

Here are some reasons why your LG TV might disappear after a few seconds, and what you can do to fix it.

### Problem with Remote Control

One of the most common causes of an LG TV disappearing after a few seconds is a problem with the remote control. Sometimes, the remote might not be able to communicate with the TV, causing it to turn off. This is especially common if the remote is old or has low batteries.

If you suspect that the remote is the problem, replace the batteries or try using a different remote control. If the problem persists, check if there is anything blocking the TV's sensor or if there are any obstructions between the remote and the TV.

### Issues with Power Supply

Another common cause of an LG TV disappearing after a few seconds is a problem with the power supply. If your TV is not getting enough power, it might turn off spontaneously. This can happen if there is a problem with the power cord or the power outlet you are using.

To fix this problem, try replacing the power cord or using a different outlet. If this doesn't work, seek professional help to examine the TV's power supply.

### Network Connection Problems

LG TVs have built-in support for various online services, including streaming platforms and social media apps. Sometimes, if there is a problem with your internet connection or LG TV's firmware, the TV might turn off unexpectedly.

To fix this issue, try resetting your internet connection or updating your TV's firmware. If the problem persists, contact LG customer support.

### Overheating

If your LG TV is overheating, it might shut down to prevent damage to the internal components. Overheating can occur due to various reasons, such as a malfunctioning cooling fan, improper ventilation, or dust buildup inside the TV.

To fix this problem, ensure that your TV is well ventilated and free from dust. You should also check if the cooling fan is working properly. If your LG TV is still overheating, contact a professional technician to check if there are any hardware issues.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, if your LG TV is disappearing after a few seconds, it can be quite frustrating. However, many of the reasons behind this issue are easy to fix. By troubleshooting the TV's remote control, power supply, network connection, and overheating issues, you can easily diagnose and solve the problem. If none of these solutions work, consider contacting a certified technician to examine the TV and suggest further solutions.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, My LG TV will turn on for a few seconds then the image will go black but audio will continue. Can anyone suggest here to begin trouble shooting?
Already tried unplugging for a period and plugging back in & changing the input source neither of which worked.

 Hi,
What is the model number of the TV?
If it is a LED TV turn on the TV and then use a torch and shine it at an angle close to the screen to see if you can detect any images at all when the screen is black and there is audio. The images will be very faint if they are there so trying this in a darkened room may help to see it.
If there are images then you have a backlight problem. This could be the power board (or maybe an inverter board) the LED strips themselves or maybe a problem with the mainboard telling the power board to turn the backlights off.
