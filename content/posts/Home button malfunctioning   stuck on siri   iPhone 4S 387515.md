Is Your iPhone 4S Possessed? Home Button Stuck on Siri!

Many iPhone 4S users have reported an issue where their home button gets stuck and activates Siri, the virtual assistant. This can be an annoying problem as it gets in the way of basic tasks such as unlocking your phone or exiting an app. So, what’s causing this issue? And how can you fix it?

The first thing to understand is that this is not a rare problem. A quick search online will reveal numerous forum posts and articles discussing the issue. There are several reasons why this might happen, including a glitch in the software, a hardware issue or even environmental factors such as moisture or dirt.

If your home button is stuck on Siri, the first thing to try is a simple reset. Hold down the power button and the home button at the same time until the Apple logo appears, then release. This will restart your phone and may resolve the issue. 

If the reset doesn’t work, you can try cleaning the home button. Use a soft toothbrush or a clean, dry cloth to gently wipe away any dust or dirt that might be causing the button to stick. Be careful not to press too hard or use any liquid as this can cause further damage to your device.

Another solution is to recalibrate the home button. To do this, go to Settings > General > Accessibility and turn on “Assistive Touch”. This will add a virtual home button to your screen, which you can use instead of your physical button. You can also change the functions of the virtual button to mimic the functions of your physical one. 

If none of these solutions work, it may be time to visit an Apple store or authorized repair center. They can diagnose any hardware problems and provide the necessary repairs. In some cases, this may involve replacing the home button itself. 

In conclusion, if you’re experiencing a stuck home button on Siri, don't panic. There are several solutions you can try before resorting to professional help. By resetting your phone, cleaning the home button or recalibrating it, you may be able to resolve the issue. And if you do need to get your device repaired, don’t hesitate to seek out professional help. Your iPhone is a valuable investment and it’s worth taking care of it.

## Chosen Solution
 The phone thinks the home button is always been pressed down. Siri continually opens and pushing the lock button usually causes the phone to screenshot. I have tried replacing the home button but it didn't solve the problem. I'm not sure if there's water damage or what but the water stickers are still white... I have also tried to restore the phone. Anyone know? Please help! Thanks
Edit: battery also does not charge, replacement battery does charge.

 Replace the charging port cause the home button connects to the it and should sort out the charging

 Next step would be to clean dock port with isopropyl alcohol. If still problem, replace charging port assembly. If still problem, then most likely logic board fault.
