# Discover the Hidden Secrets of your Power Mac G4 MDD: Learn to Identify Every Component on the Logic Board with Ease!

The Power Mac G4 MDD (Mirrored Drive Doors) was introduced by Apple in 2002, and it quickly became a popular choice for professionals in industries such as video production, graphic design, and music creation. Despite the fact that the G4 MDD is now almost two decades old, it still has a loyal following of users who appreciate its power and reliability.

Whether you're a longtime G4 MDD user or you've recently acquired one, there's no denying that this machine can be complex. With its many components and intricate architecture, it can be challenging to navigate and troubleshoot when things go wrong.

One of the most crucial parts of the G4 MDD is the logic board. This circuit board contains most of the computer's primary components, including the CPU, RAM, and graphics card. If you want to understand your G4 MDD better and troubleshoot any issues that arise, you must be able to identify each part of the logic board quickly.

In this article, we'll provide a detailed breakdown of the G4 MDD's logic board and the various components you'll find on it.

## The G4 MDD Logic Board Explained

The G4 MDD's logic board is a complex circuit board that connects and manages many of the computer's essential components. The logic board sits at the heart of the machine, and understanding it is key to diagnosing any hardware issues that may arise.

The board itself is green, and you'll find a variety of components mounted on it, including:

- CPU: The G4 MDD's PowerPC G4 processor is situated at the top of the board. It's identifiable by the large heatsink and fan used to keep it cool.
- RAM: The G4 MDD uses DDR SDRAM, which is installed in pairs. The RAM slots are located to the right of the CPU.
- AGP Slot: The AGP slot is where you'll install your graphics card, which is essential for video editing and 3D animation. You'll find this slot on the left-hand side of the board.
- PCI Slots: The G4 MDD has four PCI slots, which you can use to install additional expansion cards, such as sound cards, modems, or USB 2.0 cards.
- ATA Bus: The ATA bus is where you'll connect your hard drives and optical drives. You'll see two ATA buses on the board.
- USB Ports: The G4 MDD has two USB ports on the front of the machine, and four more on the rear of the logic board.
- Ethernet Port: You'll find the Ethernet port on the back of the board, near the PCI slots.
- FireWire Ports: The G4 MDD has two FireWire 400 ports on the front of the machine, and two more on the rear of the logic board.

## Navigating the Logic Board

If you're new to the G4 MDD, understanding the logic board's layout can be a bit overwhelming. However, by taking the time to familiarize yourself with the board's various components, you'll be better equipped to troubleshoot any issues that arise.

To begin, locate the CPU, which is the largest component on the board. From there, you can start to identify the various RAM slots, the AGP and PCI slots on the left-hand side, and the ATA buses at the bottom of the board.

Once you've identified these critical components, take a closer look at the board and try to familiarize yourself with the other components, including the USB and FireWire ports and the Ethernet jack.

## Conclusion

The Power Mac G4 MDD remains a powerful and reliable machine, thanks in large part to its intricate logic board, which brings together all of the computer's essential hardware components. Understanding the logic board and the various components on it is crucial if you want to troubleshoot issues effectively and get the most out of your G4 MDD.

By taking the time to study the logic board's layout and components, you'll be better equipped to identify and diagnose any problems that arise, whether you're a professional video editor or a casual user. So don't be intimidated by the complexity of the G4 MDD â€“ take the time to learn about its various components and unlock its hidden potential!

## Chosen Solution
 Today I plug in my G4 mdd to the power and find a components (L15) is broken.
Is anyone able to identify it?
When I connect to the power,  this  components is sparking.
Thanks a lot.

 Hi Kiizo,
I am going to guess by the reference designator that L15 is an inductor or coil of some sort. It looks like it is connected to a really beefy trace on one side. They are often used for power conditioning.
