# Unleash Your Inner Demolition Expert: Little Nightmares 2's Insane Tips on Crushing Barriers and Obstacles!

Are you tired of being stuck in one corner of the game and unable to proceed? Does the frustration of having to navigate through obstacles and barriers leave you feeling overwhelmed? Well, it's time to unleash your inner demolition expert with Little Nightmares 2's insane tips on crushing barriers and obstacles!

Little Nightmares 2, developed by Tarsier Studios, is a puzzle-platformer horror game that is both creepy and challenging. The game follows the story of Mono and Six, two children who must navigate through a terrifying world full of traps, puzzles, and monstrous enemies to uncover the secrets of the Signal Tower.

Like any puzzle-platformer game, Little Nightmares 2 offers a variety of obstacles and barriers that can impede your progress. From locked doors to electrified wires to traps, it can be challenging to figure out how to overcome them. But fear not, as we have a few tips that will help you crush those obstacles and see you through to the other side.

## 1. Use Your Environment

One of the best things about Little Nightmares 2 is the game's environment. The world you inhabit is full of interactive elements that can be used to your advantage. For example, crates, boxes, and other objects can be moved to create a pathway or used to weigh down switches.

To unlock doors, you can look for keys but when all else fails, remember to leverage the environment. With a bit of creativity, you can find ways to break doors open, create makeshift platforms, and find hidden paths to get through tricky obstacles.

## 2. Learn from Your Mistakes

Like any puzzle-platformer game, Little Nightmares 2 can be a little unforgiving especially if you are trying to navigate your way through for the first time. When you hit a barrier or obstacle, make a mental note of what went wrong and try again.

It's important to keep in mind that every attempt can be a learning opportunity. The more times you fail, the more you learn not only about the game's mechanics but your approach to the game. Don't shy away from going back to retry a section or level. Persistence is key here.

## 3. Take Your Time

It's understandable to want to reach the end goal as fast as possible, especially when you're stuck on one section. However, don't forget to take your time and carefully assess the situation. Observe your surroundings, understand what obstacles are ahead of you, and create a thoughtful plan of action.

Rushing blindly inside may lead you to make more costly mistakes leading to more irritation in the long run. But when you slow down and think through things, you set yourself up for success.

## 4. Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

While the journey through Little Nightmares 2 seems it's primarily a solo one, don't forget the power of teamwork. Mono and Six have moments where they need to work together to overcome obstacles and challenges. Work on this too. When one is stuck, it's important to communicate with each other and work together to find a solution. Co-operation can be the difference between success and failure.

Closing Thoughts

There you have it—some of Little Nightmares 2's insane tips on crushing barriers and obstacles. Remember these tips and you'll be well on your way to mastering the puzzles and platforming of Little Nightmares 2.

## How to destroy Barriers and Obstacles
 
While running in the game you will come across certain obstacles and intrusions that you might not be able to get through or jump through. In such a situation you will require to use some persuasion in the form of hurling something at the obstacle in question. While you won’t have a gun in your hand you can still shout out “Say hello to my little friend” in your best Al Pacino voice. The common objects that you will need to break are usually glass windows or sketchy photo frames that are hiding a hole in the wall. Here are some instructions on how to do just that.
 
To pick up an object you will have to click R2. Now some objects need to have something thrown at them to get them out of the way while some need to be attacked with an object to clear it out of your path. You need to keep pressing R2 while dragging or pushing the object you are going to use.
 
Now to throw something you will need to click on X or A whereas you click Y when you have to attack something with the object you’re carrying. It is possible to misjudge your aim and at times it might take a few attempts for you to get through an obstacle.
 
This is handy information as the later stages do get tougher and you will have to think smarter as you go on to escape the eerie environment. With all that said that was everything about how to destroy obstacles and barriers in Little Nightmares II.
