# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Replace Your 2015 Ford Focus SE Windshield Wipers with This Repair Guide!

Driving in a downpour with damaged windshield wipers can be a nightmare. Not only is it dangerous, but it can also be distracting and stress-inducing. It's important to check your wipers regularly and replace them when they start wearing out. For 2015 Ford Focus SE owners, the process of replacing your wipers is surprisingly simple. With this repair guide, we'll walk you through the process step-by-step, so you can keep your windshield crystal clear, even in the harshest of weather.

## Gather Your Materials

Before you start replacing your wipers, it's essential to have all of the necessary materials on hand. Here's what you'll need:

- New wiper blades (make sure to get the correct size for your vehicle)
- A small flat-head screwdriver
- A microfiber towel or cloth

## Remove the Old Wiper Blades

First, you need to remove the old wiper blades from your vehicle. Lift the wiper arm away from the windshield and locate the small lever or tab on the underside of the wiper blade. Use the flat-head screwdriver to gently pry the tab up and away from the arm. With the tab raised, you should be able to slide the wiper blade off of the arm. Repeat this process for the other wiper blade.

## Install New Wiper Blades

Once you have removed the old wiper blades, it's time to install the new ones. Start by lining up the new blade with the arm. Be sure to match the curve of the blade to the curve of the windshield. Slide the new blade onto the arm and push down until it clicks into place. Repeat this process for the other wiper blade.

## Test Your New Wiper Blades

Before you hit the road, it's crucial to test your new wiper blades. Turn on your vehicle's wipers and ensure that they are moving smoothly across the windshield. If they are leaving streaks or skipping, you may need to adjust the blades or reposition them on the arm.

## Enjoy Your Clear Windshield

Replacing your windshield wipers may seem intimidating, but it's straightforward and can be done in just a few minutes. By following this repair guide, you can keep your 2015 Ford Focus SE's windshield clean and clear, no matter the weather. With your new wiper blades installed, you'll be able to drive confidently and safely, no matter the conditions outside.
