# Is Your iPhone 6 Home Button Giving You Trouble? Find Out How to Fix It While Keeping Touch ID Intact!

If you happen to be an iPhone 6 user, you know how important the Home button is for easy access and navigation throughout your device. However, it’s not uncommon for the Home button to become unresponsive or malfunction over time, causing frustration and inconvenience for the user.

Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix your iPhone 6 Home button while also keeping your Touch ID capabilities intact. 

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to fix an unresponsive iPhone 6 Home button:

## Firstly, Try These Basic Troubleshooting Techniques:

1. Check if the phone is in Power Saving Mode. Power Saving Mode can sometimes cause certain features of the phone to shut off, including the Home button. Go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health to turn off Power Saving Mode if it is enabled.

2. Clean the Home Button: Dirt and dust can accumulate around the button, causing it to malfunction. Gently clean the Home button with a soft, lint-free cloth or a toothbrush.

3. Restart the Phone: Restarting your iPhone 6 can often fix small glitches that may be affecting the Home button. Press and hold the Power button and swipe the “slide to power off” button to restart the phone.

## If the Basic Fixes Didn’t Work, Try Calibration:

Calibrating your Home button may solve the issues of a Home button not responding or being slow to respond. Follow these instructions to calibrate your Home button:

1. Open a pre-installed Apple app such as Maps or Weather.
2. Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the “slide to power off” option appears.
3. Release the Sleep/Wake button and press and hold the Home button until the “slide to power off” option disappears.

## If Calibration doesn’t Work, Try Accessibility Settings:

If calibration didn’t work, you can try enabling the Accessibility response function. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch and turn it on.
2. You will now see a small, draggable assistive icon on your screen. You can move the icon anywhere you want on the screen.
3. Press the Home button and drag the AssistiveTouch icon to your Home button’s location.
4. To disable the icon, simply turn off the AssistiveTouch feature.

## If None of the Above Fixes Work, Look for Professional Help:

If you’ve tried everything and your Home button still isn’t working properly, it may be time to seek professional help. You can either take the device back to an Apple Store for repair or contact a certified Apple technician to help you diagnose the issue.

Fixing your iPhone 6 Home button doesn’t have to be a costly or complicated process. By following the steps outlined above, you can greatly increase your chances of fixing the problem without losing your Touch ID capabilities. Try these fixes today, and get back to using your iPhone 6 with ease and efficiency!

## Chosen Solution
 My Touch ID on my iPhone 6 works with no problem but the actual button itself does not work. I have tried re-seating the connector

 Did this happen on its own or after a screen replacement? Have you tried doing a reset of the phone?
If it happened after a screen replacement, I would try replacing the home button extension cable that is attached to the thermal plate. It can get damaged during the repair and cause the home button to malfunction.
