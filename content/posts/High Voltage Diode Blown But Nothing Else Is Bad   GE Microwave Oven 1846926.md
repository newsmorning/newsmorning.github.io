Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When This Microwave's High Voltage Diode Blew - The Results Are Shocking!

When it comes to modern-day living, the microwave is an essential appliance that has made our lives a lot easier. With just a push of a button, we can heat up our food within seconds, which would have taken much longer on a stove top. However, despite the convenience it offers, a microwave can be very dangerous if not used properly.

One of the most important components of a microwave is the high voltage diode, which is responsible for converting the incoming power into a high voltage suitable for the magnetron. The magnetron is the microwave's heart, which produces the energy that cooks the food. If the high voltage diode fails, a chain reaction can occur, leading to disastrous consequences.

Recently, I had an experience that taught me the importance of properly maintaining my appliances. I was using my microwave to heat up some leftovers when suddenly an electrical arc and a loud pop startled me. I quickly switched off the microwave and noticed a burning smell emanating from it. When I opened the door, I saw that the inside of the microwave was charred and several components had melted.

After further investigation, I discovered that the high voltage diode had blown, causing the electrical arc and the subsequent damage. The high voltage diode had failed due to a combination of age and wear and tear. It was a shocking experience that could have had more severe consequences if I hadn't acted quickly.

If you're wondering how to maintain your microwave, the best way is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. You should avoid overloading and overheating your microwave, which can stress the components and cause them to fail prematurely. Also, be mindful of the kind of utensils you use in your microwave. Most microwaves are designed to work with microwave-safe utensils, so using metal or aluminum can cause electrical arcs and damage.

In conclusion, a blown high voltage diode in a microwave is a serious issue that should not be taken lightly. It is essential to regularly maintain and follow safety instructions when using your microwave to avoid any incidents. Remember, safety always comes first!

## Chosen Solution
 My microwave was no longer heating. I took it apart and found the high voltage diode was bad but nothing else looked bad. I replaced the diode and it still didn’t heat yet the high voltage diode was not blown again. 
I’ve since checked all associated components and none look bad: HV capacitor, magnetron, HV diode, fuse.
What could  have blown the diode, not looked bad yet not not blow it a second time when it still didn’t heat?

Must my new magnetron look like this one?

 Hi,
Did you also check that the door interlocks are working properly?
Here’s an image of the magnetron circuit for a G.E. microwave.
It is NOT for your model but may be close enough to be of some help as it shows how the door interlock switch if not opening when the door is shut will still short out the HV transformer preventing current flowing through it etc.
If the interlock is OK then you may have to use an Ohmmeter to check the circuit supplying the HV section of the oven, if everything else seems to be operating OK, i.e. turntable motor, light, fan etc but there is just no heat.

Hi,
It looks like the antenna dome of the magntron has burnt out.
Here's a link that describes it better than I can.
You said that the magnetron tested OK. Is this the method that you used to test it?
Even if it tests OK with an Ohmmeter it is not being subjected to the same amount of voltage with an Ohmmeter that is being applied when operating.
To do the 2nd  method, unless there is a short circuit or low resistance path between the housing and a terminal you really need a megger tester (example only) as this will test if the insulation breaks down at the voltages that the equipment operates at and not the 9V of an Ohmmeter.
How old is the oven?
Looking at the owner manual there is a 10 year warranty on the magnetron. Not as good as it sounds as yr 1 is full parts and labour warranty and yrs 2-10 is part only ,you pay for the service call and labour.
Although it may be worth considering if applicable and you can install it yourself given the cost of a replacement.
If the warranty period is no longer applicable or even if it is and the manufacturer will only supply and install and not just supply only, then it may be more economically viable to get a new microwave oven.
