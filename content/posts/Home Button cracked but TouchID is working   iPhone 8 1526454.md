# iPhone 8 Home Button Disaster: Cracked and Broken, But TouchID Still Works Like Magic!

For many iPhone 8 users, a cracked or broken home button is a common disaster. The iPhone 8 was released in September of 2017, and the home button on this device is an important feature that helps users navigate and interact with their phones.

Unfortunately, accidents happen, and sometimes the home button can become cracked or broken. While this may seem like a disaster, there is some good news. Even when the home button is cracked or broken, TouchID can still work like magic.

For those who may not know, TouchID is the fingerprint recognition system that allows users to unlock their iPhones, make purchases, and access secure apps. Even if the home button is damaged and unresponsive, TouchID can still read and recognize a user's fingerprint.

So, how does this work? The iPhone 8's TouchID technology is actually located under the home button, which means that even if the button itself is damaged, the technology can still function properly. This is great news for iPhone 8 users who may be worried about losing access to their phone's security features.

In fact, some users have reported that their TouchID sensors work even better after their home buttons have been cracked or broken. This is because the damage to the home button can actually create a larger surface area for the sensor to read fingerprints from, resulting in more accurate and reliable recognition.

Of course, there are still some limitations to using TouchID without a fully functioning home button. For example, users may not be able to use Siri or take screenshots using the home button. Additionally, some users may experience issues when using certain apps that rely heavily on the home button for navigation.

But overall, having a cracked or broken home button on your iPhone 8 doesn't have to be a disaster. Thanks to the reliable and efficient TouchID technology, you can still use your phone with ease and security.

In conclusion, while a cracked or broken home button may seem like a disaster, iPhone 8 users should rest assured that TouchID can still work like magic. With this innovative technology, you can still unlock your phone, make purchases, and access secure apps with ease and security. So, if you find yourself in this situation, don't panic – just remember that your iPhone 8 is still a reliable device, even without a fully functioning home button.

## Chosen Solution
 There is any way how to replace the home button and keeping the touchID ?
my phone was totally broken but I been able to replace screen and unfortunately the home button was working but Fingerprint still work. I would like to make some mechanical replacement and keeping the electronic part of the home button , Is that possible ?

 Not possible. The sensor chip is glued to the crystal part of the button, the chip is thinner than human hair and the glue is actually stronger than the chip.
You’ll just end up cracking the chip.
