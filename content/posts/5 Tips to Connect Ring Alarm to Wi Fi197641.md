Unlock The Secret To Effortlessly Connecting Your Ring Alarm To Wi-Fi With These 5 Genius Tips!

Are you struggling with connecting your Ring Alarm to your Wi-Fi network? Don't worry; you are not alone. Setting up Ring Alarm is essential to ensure the safety of your home and loved ones, but the process can be complicated. Fortunately, we have got you covered with these 5 genius tips to help you effortlessly connect your Ring Alarm to Wi-Fi.

1. Keep Your Router Modern

The first thing you need to do is to ensure that your router is modern and up to date. The Ring Alarm is designed to work best with modern routers that have the latest Wi-Fi specifications. If your router is too old or outdated, it may not be compatible with your Ring Alarm. We recommend upgrading your router to a modern one that is compatible with the latest Wi-Fi tech specs.

2. Get the Right Wi-Fi Network

Your Ring Alarm will only connect to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. This is because the Ring Alarm is not compatible with 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks. Therefore, to ensure that your Ring Alarm connects successfully to the Wi-Fi network, you must connect it to the designated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network in your home.

3. Position Your Router Close to Your Ring Alarm

Distance plays a significant role in the range and strength of your Wi-Fi network. If your router is located far away from your Ring Alarm, you may encounter difficulties connecting your Ring Alarm to Wi-Fi. Ideally, you should position your router close to your Ring Alarm to ensure a stable and reliable connection. This will also help to eliminate any signal interference that may be caused by walls or other obstacles.

4. Increase The Wi-Fi Signal Strength

If you have followed the steps above and still find that your Ring Alarm is not connecting to your Wi-Fi network, there are a few things you can do to increase the Wi-Fi signal strength. You can, for instance, use a Wi-Fi extender to boost the signal or invest in a Mesh Wi-Fi system to extend the Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home.

5. Reset Your Ring Alarm

Finally, if all else fails, the best way to connect your Ring Alarm to Wi-Fi is to reset it. To reset your Ring Alarm, press and hold down the reset button on the control panel until the LED light turns off. Once the LED light has turned off, release the button, and your Ring Alarm will start the reset process. This process will erase all the settings on your Ring Alarm and start the setup process from scratch.

Conclusion

Connecting your Ring Alarm to Wi-Fi can be challenging, but with these five genius tips, you will be able to connect it effortlessly. Remember to upgrade your router, ensure that you have the right Wi-Fi network, position your router close to your Ring Alarm, increase the signal strength, and reset your Ring Alarm if all else fails. Good luck!

Connecting your Ring Alarm to your home’s internet is the final step in getting your home security system online and monitoring your property. But because Ring requires certain standards to maintain a strong connection with its devices, you may be wondering about some best practices for connecting your alarm to Wi-Fi.
 
Ring security products are designed with the homeowner in mind. The Ring Alarm is easily installed and activated, bypassing the need to have a professional install it, along with the added cost. While the setup process is outlined in detail to help you achieve this, certain situations can arise that might require some troubleshooting. Keep reading to learn five important tips to help you connect your Ring Alarm to Wi-Fi.
 
## Have Bluetooth Enabled on Your Smartphone
 
To complete the connection process, you must have Bluetooth enabled on your smartphone. If you have turned this setting off, or this is the first time you are using it on that device, you will need to enter your phone’s settings and turn it on.
 
For an iOS device, swipe to open your settings, and then tap the Bluetooth icon to turn it on. If you are running iOS 13, open your privacy settings and enable your Bluetooth sharing to enable the Ring app.
 
Swipe down to enter your phone settings with an Android device and enable Bluetooth after tapping the icon.
 
## Check Your Bluetooth Connection
 
Suppose you receive an error message informing you that the connection to the Bluetooth has been lost during the setup process.
 
In that case, it is possible that you may have either moved too far away from the router and Base Station to finish the process or if you allow too much time to pass with inactivity and the process ends.
 
Choose Try Again after ensuring that Bluetooth is enabled, and then restart the process. After the setup process is complete for Wi-Fi and the Base Station, you will no longer need Bluetooth to use your Ring Alarm with the app.
 
## Enable Location Access to the Ring App
 
Some Android phones require location access. Since enabling this setting is required to set up the Ring Alarm in these circumstances, after setup is complete, you have the option to turn location access off to protect your privacy.
 
## Ensure Your Base Station is Compatible
 
If you have recently moved, there could be an issue with the Ring Base Station. Owning a Base Station designed for an incompatible region will prevent you from connecting your Ring Alarm to the Wi-Fi. It is recommended that you return this Base Station and purchase products designed to work where you currently reside.
 
## Check Your Wi-Fi Signal
 
Seeing an error message that states, “Something went wrong during setup” can mean that while you have everything you need to complete the process, there could have been a connection issue related to your Wi-Fi signal.
 
Also, you might not have the proper signal strength to complete the setup. You can try moving the Base Station closer to the router you are attempting to connect to or select Add Network Manually in the Ring app to add the Wi-Fi network yourself. An iOS device will require you to begin the setup process again, while an Android device will rescan for networks.
 
## Troubleshooting the Connection for Ring Alarm and Wi-Fi
 
Sometimes you may experience the inability to get your Ring Alarm set up with your Wi-Fi. Ring has comprehensive support options on the website to get your connected quickly:
