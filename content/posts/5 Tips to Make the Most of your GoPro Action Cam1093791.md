# Discover How to Capture Epic Adventure Footage with These 5 Mind-Blowing GoPro Hacks!

If you're an adrenaline junkie or an adventure enthusiast, chances are you've probably heard of the GoPro–the small, lightweight camera that's designed to capture action footage. Whether you're a professional filmmaker or a leisurely traveler, the GoPro is the perfect tool to help you record unforgettable memories. Here are 5 GoPro hacks that will let you capture epic footage on your next adventure:

## 1. Use the Rat Rig Camera Cage

The Rat Rig Camera Cage is a versatile and lightweight accessory that can be used to mount your GoPro to a variety of surfaces. Simply attach the camera cage to your helmet or bike frame, and you'll be able to shoot stable footage, even when you're moving at high speeds. 

## 2. Employ a Customizable Shutter Trigger

A customizable shutter trigger allows you to take photos remotely, without having to touch the camera. This is perfect for capturing action shots when you're in the middle of the action. With a remote trigger, you can position your camera wherever you need it, then take the shot at the perfect moment.

## 3. Use a Snorkel Attachment for Underwater Footage

If you love snorkeling, you don't need to invest in an expensive underwater camera. A GoPro with a snorkel attachment can capture breathtaking underwater footage. 

## 4. Try a Drone!

Drones have revolutionized the way we capture aerial footage. With a drone, you can capture stunning views of landscapes, mountains, and cityscapes. The DJI Phantom 4 Pro is an excellent drone for capturing action footage, and it can be paired with your GoPro to capture stunning aerial perspectives.

## 5. Utilize a Gimbal for Steady Footage

Gimbals are small, handheld devices that help stabilize your camera while you're moving. They work by using gyroscopes and accelerometers to counteract movements, ensuring that your footage is smooth and steady. A good gimbal can be used to capture stable footage while skiing, mountain biking, or even skydiving.

Conclusion:

With these tips and hacks, you'll be able to capture epic footage of your adventures that you can share with your friends, family, and followers. Whether you're a professional adventurer or a casual traveler, a GoPro is an essential tool for capturing the memories that will last a lifetime.

Fill your life with adventures, not things. Have stories to tell, not stuff to show!
 
How much do you agree with us on this? Well, life is too short to sit calm, as there’s so much to explore and experience. Taking a break from our hectic monotonous routine once in a while is really important. Whether you’re heading out for a vacation with your family or taking a solo trip to get a raw taste of adventure, we all love to capture our beautiful moments, right? Well, if you’re an adrenaline junkie who craves for an adventure more than anything in life, GoPro can be your ideal travel companion. In this post, we will be covering some of the best GoPro tips and tricks that can enhance your photography experience like never before.
 
Remember those days when we used to carry those bulky DSLRs with us? Thanks to technology and innovation (Phew), for launching portable teeny-light cameras like GoPro that we can carry on the go. And yes, not to forget, they are waterproof too! So now, whether you are thousands of miles in the sky or skydiving deep within the ocean, GoPro is all you need to get that perfect shot!
 
But before you move ahead, it’s probably time to introduce Duplicate Files Fixer. As its name suggests, this tool can sift through thousands of video files to find duplicate copies. You can then delete these useless copies to recover new space on your system. Duplicate Files Fixer is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Android, making it a highly versatile storage space recovery tool for all GoPro users.
 
Here are a few GoPro tips and tricks that will allow you to make the most from this action camera and to make your adventure experience more memorable.
 

 
### Always Use a Mount
 
Using a mount will not only allow you to click pictures from different perspectives but will also keep your GoPro device safe. Also, a mount can be a great idea when you’re capturing a video, say for a hike or bicycle tour off the mountains. You can use a mount and attach your GoPro cam to enjoy your adventure in hands-free mode. A wide range of mounts are available online, so order the one which you think will prove out best for your purpose.
 
### It’s All About the Perspective
 
If you’re a solo traveler or a big-shot travel influencer with hundreds of followers on social media, we all want to click pictures in the best possible angle, right? As the GoPro cam is super portable and light-weighted, it gives you plenty of options to try something new, to capture the scene from a different perspective. Try recording in different camera positions and see which one looks more appealing. This is one of the best GoPro tips and tricks that you can try without spending a lot on buying accessories and gadgets.
 
### Use Tripod for Static Shots
 
It’s not always that we use GoPro cam for capturing videos, right? GoPro is ideal for clicking static shots too and for that you should definitely use a tripod to stabilize the image. Tripods use electronic image stabilization technology to minimize blurriness and allow you to capture perfect stationery shots. So, it’s always a great idea to gear up and collect a few third-party accessories before you head out for your new adventure.
 
### Add Filters and Music
 
Adding an extra touch of perfection, whether it’s about adding image or video filters or to add a soundtrack in the background will always make your GoPro moments much more appealing. You can use any image or video editing application, select a pre-made filter which makes your existing image better and then upload it to social media so that your friends and followers will be awestruck in woo.
 
### Adjust the Frame Rate
 
Depending on what content you’re shooting from your GoPro action camera, make sure that you adjust the frame rate beforehand. For example, you can use a higher frame rate if you’re shooting outdoors in sunny conditions, or if you’re capturing a slow-motion video of shooting in low light conditions then drop the frame rate to around 30 fps. Also, if you’re shooting a story-driven content then an ideal frame rate is 24fps that will allow you to capture the video in a cinematic feel.
 
Conclusion
 
There were a few GoPro tips and tricks that you might take in use to get the best from your adventures. If you consider yourself an adrenaline junkie, then having a GoPro cam as your travel companion is a must. Always try and tell a story when you’re recording moments on your GoPro cam. It will make your moments much more memorable and also make your followers happy on social media platforms.
 
So, are you all set to go for your next adventure trip?
