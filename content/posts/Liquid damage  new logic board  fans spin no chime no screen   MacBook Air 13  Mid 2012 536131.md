Liquid damage is one of the most dreaded accidents when it comes to tech devices. Unfortunately, it's also one of the most common accidents that can happen to any MacBook Air user. And when it happens, it can lead to the death of your device, as the intricate circuits can short out and cause severe damage.

So, what do you do when you spill liquid on your MacBook Air? Most people panic and don't know what to do next. However, there's one solution that can save your MacBook Air from a near-death experience: rice.

Yes, you read that right. Rice can become your MacBook Air's savior after liquid damage. It's a miraculous solution that could repair any laptop or mobile device that has suffered from liquid damage.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to fix your MacBook Air using rice:

1. Turn off your MacBook Air: When you spill liquid on your device, the first step is to switch it off immediately. You do not want any electricity running through the circuits, as that could cause even more damage.

2. Remove external accessories: Unplug all external accessories, such as an external hard drive or charger. You want to make sure that no other component is affected by the liquid spill.

3. Remove as much liquid as possible: Use an absorbent towel or cloth to wipe away any excess liquid from the device's exterior. Then, tilt your MacBook Air sideways to help drain any liquid that may have entered the device's interior.

4. Place your MacBook Air in a bowl of rice: Fill a bowl or container with dry, uncooked rice. Then, place your MacBook Air flat on the rice, ensuring that no part of the device is touching the container's edges. Cover the bowl with a lid or clear plastic wrap.

5. Leave your MacBook Air for at least 48 hours: Rice works to draw out moisture from your MacBook Air. Leave your device in the rice-filled container for at least 48 hours, or up to 72 hours, to ensure that all moisture has been drawn out of the device's internal structure.

6. Power on your MacBook Air: Once you're sure that the device is completely dry, you can turn it back on. If your MacBook Air starts up as normal, then congratulations! Rice worked its magic, and you've successfully saved your device from near-death after liquid damage.

In conclusion, if you ever spill liquid on your MacBook Air, don't panic. Rice can become your device's savior and miraculously save it from a near-death experience. The next time you suffer from liquid damage, just remember this step-by-step guide, and your MacBook Air will be back to its normal self in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi guys, feeling defeated as of now.
I spilled a large coffee, turned everything off and let dry for days as one should.
Tried it, nothing. No orange charging light.
Replaced logic board and it showed the orange light. The fans suddenly started to spin at full speed but no chime and no screen.
Tried turning on with the power on button but nothing. I suspected it was the keyboard so I disconnected the charger and the keyboard and back light ribbon, then used a flat headed screwdriver on the powerpads to fake a power on button press. This started the machine, the fans on full speed, the ssd lights on, yet still no  chime and no screen.
I've inspected the screen connector as well as everything else and can't see any corrosion or any abnormalities.
So my understanding is the logic board is OK, the battery is OK, ssd OK, maybe the keyboard is dead but the powerpad turns it on but no chime and no screen.
What do I do next? Other than to smash it to pieces, what's next?
Thanks so much in advance!
Update (02/18/2022)
Hi Dan, thanks for your speedy reply.
I took it to a repair shop the guy said it’s probably the logic board and quoted me something silly so I bought a replacement logic board online that said was tested and that had a 30 day return.
The new logic board fixes the charging light issue. The new logic board powers the fans when I plug in the charger both with the battery in and out, as well as spins the fans when only operating under battery and switched on using the power pad.
I've disconnected the screen cable and the battery and when I charge it the fan spins and the harddrive lights up. I've also tried this with and without the ssd and Bluetooth card with no luck.
The new logic board is from the same year (mid 2012) model number a1466 2ghz i7 8gb ram, same as what it was replacing.
I've also tried with and without the speaker and webcam cables and booting with just the charger and no battery, still no chime (I know there won't be a chime if there's no speaker connected) but still no screen.
With the keyboard ribbon and the back light ribbon connected I'm still able to use the power pad to fake a power button press which suggests the keyboard connection isn't being registered.
I'm now thinking perhaps it's as simple as a smc or pram reset but without the keyboard functionality I'm able to press and hold the required buttons.
Should I buy a new upper case, with the track pad and keyboard with backlight and attempt the smc and pram or disk utility?

 Lets backup here… Why did you think the original logic board was bad? From what you’ve described you have other damage from the coffee spill.
Frankly, we don’t recommend letting it sit to stew or assume hither limited air flow will tryout your system. Even still the salts, sugars and acids within your drink would still be present after the water evaporated.
What logic board did you put in maybe you got the wrong one.
So… I would discoed your battery and display and just using the MagSafe charger see if the system starts up at that point.
