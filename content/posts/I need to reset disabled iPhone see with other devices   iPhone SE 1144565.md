# You Won't Believe This Trick for Resetting Your Disabled iPhone SE Using Other Devices!

If you own an iPhone SE and have experienced a disabled or locked out phone, you know how frustrating it can be. It might seem like the only solution is to bring it to an Apple store to get it fixed, or worst-case scenario, purchase a new phone altogether. However, there is an easy trick that you can try using other Apple devices that you might already have in your home. 

Before we go into the details of the trick, let's first understand why your iPhone SE might be disabled. This can happen when you enter the wrong passcode multiple times, resulting in the phone disabling itself for security reasons. It's a safety feature to protect your personal data from intruders, but it can also happen accidentally when a child or someone who doesn't know your passcode tries to use your phone. 

Now, let's get into the trick. To reset your disabled iPhone SE, you'll need to have two Apple devices at hand: one running iOS 10 or later and the other running iOS 7 or earlier. You might have an old iPod touch, iPad, or iPhone lying around that you haven't used in a while that could do the job. 

Follow these easy steps to reset your disabled iPhone SE using other devices:

1. Connect your iPhone SE to the device running iOS 10 or later using a lightning cable. 

2. Open iTunes on that device and enter the passcode if prompted. 

3. On your disabled iPhone SE, press and hold the home button until the message "Connect to iTunes" appears. Release the home button. 

4. On the device running iOS 10 or later, iTunes should recognize that your iPhone SE is in recovery mode and prompt you to restore it. Click "Restore." 

5. Follow the instructions on the screen to set up your iPhone SE as a new device or restore from iCloud or iTunes backup. 

And voila! Your disabled iPhone SE should now be reset and usable again. 

Of course, this trick may not work for everyone, and it's not foolproof. It's always best to prevent your phone from getting disabled in the first place by remembering your passcode, giving it to trusted individuals only, and setting up Touch ID or Face ID if your iPhone SE supports it. But if you're in a pinch and need a quick fix, give this trick a try. 

In conclusion, if your iPhone SE is disabled, don't panic. Try this simple trick using other Apple devices running different operating systems to reset it. And remember to always make a habit of keeping your phone passcode-protected and secure.
