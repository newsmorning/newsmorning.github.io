Title: Is Your MacBook Air 13 Retina Display Late 2018 Dead? This Simple Trick Will Bring it Back to Life!

Introduction:

MacBooks are known for their reliability and performance, but sometimes even the best of machines can fail. If you own a MacBook Air 13 Retina Display Late 2018, you may find yourself in a situation where your laptop suddenly stops working. Nothing can be more frustrating than a dead laptop, especially when you have important work to do. However, there is no need to panic; there is a simple trick that can bring your MacBook Air back to life.

Body:

The first thing you need to do is to understand the reason behind the sudden death of your MacBook Air. There can be multiple reasons for this. It could be due to a software issue, a hardware failure, or it may have simply run out of battery. Typically, when your MacBook Air fails to turn on or respond, it is related to a hardware issue. The most common hardware issue is a malfunctioning power adapter or charger. If your MacBook is not holding charge and not charging up at all, it could be due to a bad charger or an issue with the charging port.

The first thing you should do when your MacBook Air stops working is to check the power source. Plug in the charger and ensure that it is connected securely. Make sure that the charger is working fine by checking if the charging indicator light is on. If the green or amber light is on, it means that the charger is working correctly, and your MacBook is charging. If there is no light at all or the light is flickering, it may be an issue with the charger itself. You may want to borrow a friend's charger to check if it's the charger that's causing the issue or the charging port on your MacBook.

If the charging port is the problem, you will need to visit an Apple Store or a certified repair center to get it fixed. If the charging adapter is the issue, you may be able to fix it yourself. First, unplug the charger and remove the cord from the power brick. Next, check the charging cord for any damages or kinks. Make sure it's not frayed or worn out, and if it is, consider purchasing a new charger.

If the charging cord seems fine, plug it back into the MacBook and the power source. Press the power button and hold it for at least 10-15 seconds. This will reset the SMC (System Management Controller) and bring the MacBook back to life. If this still doesn't work, try resetting the PRAM (Parameter Random Access Memory) by holding down both the Option, Command, P and R keys simultaneously.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, if you're facing issues with your MacBook Air 13 Retina Display Late 2018, do not panic. The reason for the issue could be a minor one, and you may be able to fix it yourself. Start by checking your charger and the charging port, as these are the most common culprits. If nothing works, try resetting the SMC and PRAM. By following these simple steps, you can fix your MacBook Air and continue using it without any further trouble.

## Chosen Solution
 So we got this Air - Late 2018 A1932. Which I think turns on, the fans are sometimes spinning, and/or the logic board gets a bit warm,  so I think there's some kind of activity at least.
Here is what we know so far :
Black screenExternal screen not working (tried with USB C adapter with HDMI port)No startup soundTried disabling some of the connections like battery, speakers, audio jack board etc - no luckDifferent charger - no luckNo visible fluid damage
I don’t have much experience in these “newer” MacBooks, so could anyone suggest what I can test next? I dont have the skills to do “component” testing.
But any guidance or suggestions would be awesome!

 Sadly, there is very little you can do with these systems. From what you are describing your logic board has failed MacBook Air 13” Retina Display Late 2018 Logic Board Replacement
