Title: iPhone 7 Users Beware: Screen Replacement Leads to Non-Functioning Home Button!

Introduction:
Apple has always been known for providing its customers with top-notch technology and services. However, one issue that has been plaguing iPhone 7 users is the home button malfunctioning after screen replacement. This issue has left many customers frustrated and disappointed, with some even having to buy a new phone. In this article, we will delve deeper into the issue and offer some solutions.

Body:
Why does the home button stop working after screen replacement?
The home button is a critical component of the iPhone 7, and it's responsible for a variety of functions such as unlocking the phone and taking the owner back to the home screen. However, users who replace their damaged screens with aftermarket screens often experience issues with the home button. The reason behind this problem is that the home button is connected to the phone's motherboard, and the motherboard is tied to the original screen. When the screen is replaced, the new screen and the motherboard may not be compatible, causing the home button to malfunction.

What are the solutions to this problem?
There are a few solutions for iPhone 7 users experiencing home button problems after screen replacement. The first solution is to take the phone back to Apple, where technicians can typically fix the problem for a fee. The second solution is to contact the seller of the aftermarket screen and ask for a compatible one. Thirdly, users can try to reset their phone. This might solve the issue temporarily.

Conclusion:
The malfunctioning of the iPhone 7 home button after screen replacement is a frustrating issue for many users. Even though there are some solutions mentioned in this article, it's best to go to an official Apple repair center. Using non-branded products for such procedures as screen replacement can cause more extensive damage and result in unnecessary cost.

With that said, Apple users should be cautious before replacing their screens or any other parts of their phones with non-branded products. It's always better to spend a little more upfront for quality and guaranteed results rather than running the risk of damaging the phone in the long run, which could result in more extensive repairs and expenses.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I just changed the display of an iPhone 7 and moved the home button to the new one (an amazon cheap display) but it stopped working.
I checked if I damaged the home button by replacing the display with the older one and the home button returned work, so is not damaged.
I think the problem is the new display, but I wanted to know if by buying an originale genuine used display I can solve the problem 100%. Do home buttons always work with original display and just give problems with not original ones?
I also discovered that if I press hard the screen to use the 3D Touch I can see some liquid pixel, and this happens in both of the screen that I bought from amazon (2 different link but the best reviewed on amazon)…

1- So the questions are, the liquid lcd that appear is a problem of the display or it can be something else (The battery is not bigger than it should).
2- If the home button still works, but doesn’t work with the not original display, can I solve it buying an original one?

 I found some originale display grade A for 35 euro, and if it’s sure that they don’t give problems to the home button I will buy them
