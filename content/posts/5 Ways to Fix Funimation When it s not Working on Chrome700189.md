Is Funimation Causing You Frustration? Discover 5 Simple Fixes for a Smooth Streaming Experience on Chrome!

Funimation is a popular streaming platform that offers a wide range of anime shows and movies. With a massive collection of content, it's no wonder that many anime fans jump at the chance to subscribe to Funimation, but what about when the platform starts causing frustration as you try to stream your favorite shows? Don't worry; we've got you covered. Keep reading to discover five simple fixes to optimize your Funimation streaming experience on Chrome!

Clear Your Cache

A quick and easy solution to improve streaming on Funimation is to clear your cache. Your browser cache stores temporary files that can slow down your system's performance, causing streaming lag. Clearing the cache will remove these files and free up space, leading to a smoother streaming experience. To clear your cache, go to the "Settings" menu on your Chrome browser and choose "More Tools," then "Clear Browsing Data."

Update Your Browser

Another reason Funimation may be frustrating to stream is due to outdated browser software. Make sure you're running the latest version of Google Chrome to ensure that the browser has the latest security updates and optimization improvements. To update your browser, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser, then select "Help," then "About Google Chrome."

Disable Extensions

Extensions can be handy tools on your browser, but they can also cause streaming issues on Funimation. Disabling extensions can help fix compatibility issues, and it's easy to do. Go to the "Settings" menu and choose "Extensions." Once there, simply toggle switches to disable any extensions that you think could be causing streaming problems.

Use Ethernet Instead of Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is handy, but a wired connection provides more stable internet speeds and can improve the streaming experience. If you're experiencing lag or buffering when streaming Funimation, it's time to invest in an Ethernet cable. A wired connection can provide faster and more consistent internet speeds, which means a smoother streaming experience of your favorite anime.

Adjust the Playback Quality

If you're still experiencing issues while streaming on Funimation and none of the above fixes have helped, reducing the playback quality could be the solution. The platform offers a range of quality options to optimize the streaming experience based on internet speeds, and low-quality options can reduce buffering while watching. Simply click on the setting icon on the video player and adjust the playback quality.

Conclusion

Funimation is an excellent streaming platform for anime lovers. However, difficulties while streaming can cause frustration. Luckily, with some simple fixes, you can optimize your experience and enjoy your favorite shows without any technical issues. Try starting with clearing your cache, updating your browser, and disabling extensions, and if issues persist, try connecting to Ethernet or adjusting the playback quality. You're now on your way to uninterrupted streaming on Funimation!
