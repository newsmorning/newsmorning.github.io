Water Disaster Strikes! Is Your Samsung Galaxy S6 Doomed by a Wet Charger Port?

When water disasters happen, we often worry about our safety, our homes, our belongings. And in the digital age, one question that may come to mind is whether our precious electronic devices have survived the deluge. One particular concern that Samsung Galaxy S6 owners may have is whether their phones' charger port has been damaged by water. Let's explore this topic further and see what can be done to prevent or fix the problem.

First, it's important to understand why water can be a problem for your phone's charger port. The charger port is designed to receive power and data through a cable that connects to a charging block or a computer. The port has small pins and contacts that transmit the signals, and if those contacts are wet or damp, the electricity can short or cause corrosion. Furthermore, water can mix with other potential contaminants that might be present in the port, such as dust or dirt, and create a conductive residue that worsens the damage.

So, does that mean that your Samsung Galaxy S6 is doomed if it gets wet? Not necessarily. It depends on how much water has penetrated the charger port and for how long. If you dropped your phone in a pool or a sink, for instance, the chances are that water has seeped in, so you should act fast. Here are some tips:

- Turn off your phone: This is the first thing you should do to prevent any further potential damage. Long-press the power button until the screen goes black, and do not try to turn it back on even if it seems to have dried.

- Dry the phone: This step can be tricky, but it's essential to remove as much water as possible from your phone as soon as possible. Do not use heat or a hairdryer, as this can damage the phone further, and do not shake or tap the phone too hard. Use a soft cloth or paper towel to gently absorb the moisture, taking special care to wipe the charger port and any other openings or buttons. You can also use a vacuum cleaner or a blowdryer (on cool air mode) to remove water from the ports. Avoid using compressed air as this can damage the port even more.

- Use rice or a silica gel packet: This is a popular method to help dry out the phone more thoroughly. Get a bowl, fill it with dry rice or silica gel packets, and bury your phone in it completely. Leave it there for at least 24 hours, and resist the temptation to check on it or turn it on during that time.

- Check the phone: After a day, take out your phone and examine it carefully. Is the charger port visibly wet or corroded? Are there any signs of water damage, such as water spots or foggy camera lenses? If you're unsure, you can try plugging in the charger cable and see if the phone responds. If it does, you're in luck. If it doesn't, the port might need cleaning or replacement by a professional technician.

- Take preventive measures: Finally, if you've survived the water disaster with your Samsung Galaxy S6 intact, you may want to consider taking some steps to prevent it from happening again. You can buy a waterproof case, use a waterproof bag or pouch, or avoid bringing your phone near water sources as much as possible. You can also invest in a wireless charger, which eliminates the need for the physical port altogether.

In conclusion, water disasters can be unpredictable and devastating, and our phones are no exception to the potential damage. However, with some quick thinking, fast action, and preventive measures, we can increase the likelihood of saving our Samsung Galaxy S6 from a wet charger port. Remember to stay calm, be careful, and never put your safety at risk for the sake of a gadget.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I accidentally got my samsung galaxy s6 wet today while wetting down my car. Now it didn't get soaked but i did notice most of the water that had sprayed on it was near the charging port. It hasn't been able to charge since. I turned it off and on and when it restarted it said "android starting" which it has never ever done or said such thing. As well as a Samsung virtual app keeps popping up and I've never seen or heard of this app. My main concern is charging it it's dead and I need my phone asap as my parents are gone on vacation out of the country and I'm home alone with my 3 year old. HELP PLEASE

 I had the same problem in my s7. And i took it to moblie phones repairing and he told there is water inside the charger port.....hope you understand what i ment
