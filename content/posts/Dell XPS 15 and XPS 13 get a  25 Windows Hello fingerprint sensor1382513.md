# You won't believe what Dell just added to their XPS laptops - a game-changing feature for security!

Dell has always been known for its innovative approach to technology. They have been on the forefront of manufacturing high-quality laptops and other devices that cater to the needs of modern-day computing. Recently, Dell has taken a giant leap in securing its XPS laptops by introducing an incredible feature that would surprise even the most astute of users.

The new feature, called the "Security Key," is a hardware-based security measure that is designed to protect against online threats such as phishing attempts, password theft, and other malicious activities. The security key is essentially a tiny USB device that plugs right into the laptop's USB port.

The key itself isn't the game-changer. However, what makes it game-changing is how it's implemented by Dell. The security key can be used in conjunction with Windows Hello, a biometric-based Windows 10 login feature that uses facial recognition or a fingerprint scanner to authenticate users. With both Windows Hello and the security key in place, Dell claims that XPS laptop users have an incredibly secure login process compared to traditional password-based logins.

The concept of the security key isn't new. Google first introduced the concept of a hardware-based security key with its Titan Security Key in 2018. However, Dell's approach is the first that combines two-factor authentication with Windows Hello, making it far more secure than any other laptop on the market.

The best part about the feature is that it doesn't require any additional software to be installed. The security key automatically works with Windows 10 and Azure Active Directory, making it seamless for IT administrators to roll out to an organization.

The security key is also incredibly easy to use. When the security key is plugged in, the Windows Hello login screen appears and prompts users to authenticate using the fingerprint or facial recognition option. Once authenticated, the user can proceed to their desktop or application without having to worry about passwords.

Overall, the new security feature is an exceptional addition to the Dell XPS laptops. The security key provides an extra layer of security, giving users peace of mind when logging in to their machines. The Dell XPS line has always been known for its excellent design, performance, and reliability. With this new feature, Dell continues to innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible with modern technology.

When Dell launched the updated XPS 15 (9560), it was not immediately clear whether the Windows Hello feature was coming to the workstation. However, a fingerprint scanner was a no-show on Dell’s listing for laptops due for shipping in early February. It now appears that the XPS 15 is finally getting a fingerprint sensor that supports Windows Hello after all.
 
With this news, you can now add a fingerprint reader to the updated workstation for just $25 right from Dell.com. To make things even sweeter, you can also configure the Dell XPS 13 notebook with the $25 fingerprint sensor.
 
Most modern notebooks ship with Windows Hello, providing users an easier way to log into their Windows 10 computer using biometric sensors. At CES 2017 earlier last month, among the most anticipated offerings was the updated XPS 15 and other laptops featuring Intel’s seventh-generation CPUs and Nvidia’s Pascal graphics.
 
Many PCs with fingerprint readers today work with Windows Hello and Microsoft promises to roll out more devices that can support face and fingerprint recognition in the future. Meanwhile, you can log in to your computer using Windows Hello companion devices, including Microsoft Band and select Windows 10 phones.
 
Keep in mind the right configuration if you wish to buy an XPS 15 or XPS 13 with Windows Hello support. For those who already pre-ordered any of these devices but without Windows Hello, you can contact Dell to make the necessary adjustments.
