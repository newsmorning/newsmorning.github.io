3. Tap on 'Factory data reset.'

4. Tap on 'Reset device' and then 'Delete all.'

Not only will it save you money, but it's also an easy process that anyone can do. After the reset, your phone will be just as good as new, and you can enjoy all the features and functionalities that made you fall in love with it in the first place.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a samsung galaxy s3 android phone from straight talk. it got infected with ransomware and i am unable to uninstall the app even on safe mode. im trying to find a way to transfer my apps from the infected phone to my new one. ive searched and searched and there are many ways to do it but i cant use any of the ways because i cant uninstall the ransomeware. even if i transfer the files to an sdcard some internal files stay on the old phone. i dont want to lose my memory.

 Have you tried backing up your phone using Samsung Kies?
Back up bookmarks, contacts, photos and messages.
Don't backup your apps.
Download a fresh copy on the new phone, or redownload after a factory reset.
