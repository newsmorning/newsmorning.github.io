# Are You Tired of the Wrong Name Showing Up on Skype for Business? Don't Panic - This Quick Fix Will Save Your Day!

If you're like most people, you rely on Skype for Business to stay in touch with coworkers and clients. But what happens when you keep getting called the wrong name? It can be frustrating and embarrassing, but fear not! There's a quick and easy fix that will save your day.

## The Problem

Skype for Business uses your display name to identify you to other users, but sometimes it gets it wrong. Maybe you changed your name recently and forgot to update your settings, or perhaps you have a common name and the wrong person is showing up in search results.

Whatever the reason, the wrong name can give the wrong impression. If a client sees the wrong name, they might think you're unprofessional or not paying attention to details. And if your coworkers keep calling you by the wrong name, it can make you feel undervalued or disrespected.

## The Solution

1. Open Skype for Business and click on the gear icon in the top right corner to access your settings.
2. Click on "Tools" and then "Options."
3. In the "Personal" section, click on "General."
4. Under "General," you'll see a field for "Display Name." If it's incorrect, simply type in the correct name.
5. Click "OK" and you're done!

It's as simple as that. Now, whenever you sign into Skype for Business, your correct name will show up for all your contacts to see.

## Why It's Important

Ensuring that your display name is correct might seem like a small thing, but it can have a big impact. Your name is how others identify you, and it's also a reflection of your professionalism and attention to detail.

By taking a minute to update your display name, you're showing your coworkers, clients, and anyone else you communicate with on Skype for Business that you take your work seriously and that you care about the image you project.

## Conclusion

Getting called the wrong name on Skype for Business can be frustrating, but it's a problem that's easy to fix. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can ensure that your correct name shows up for all your contacts.
