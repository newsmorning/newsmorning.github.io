## Are Your Bose Quietcomfort 25 Headphones Ruining Your Ears? The Shocking Truth About High Pitch Feedback

If you're a fan of listening to music wherever you go, you're not alone. Whether on the train, bus, or just walking around town, many people love to have their Bose Quietcomfort 25 headphones on hand for a little aural escape. However, research has shown that these popular headphones may be causing permanent hearing damage, particularly when they emit high pitch feedback.

At first glance, it might seem that feedback can be easily ignored or avoided, but the reality is that it can cause serious, long-term damage to your hearing. When you are using headphones or earbuds that produce high pitch feedback – the type that can cause a sharp pain or ringing sensation in your ears – the sensitive hair cells inside the ear can be permanently damaged, and over time, this can lead to tinnitus, hearing loss or even deafness.

So what causes this high pitch feedback? In some cases, it's just the quality of the headphones or earbuds you are using – cheap or poorly made headphones can generate feedback, particularly if they are turned up too loud. But with Bose's Quietcomfort 25 headphones, the problem runs deeper.

The Bose Quietcomfort 25 is designed to block out ambient noise, allowing music to be heard more clearly. However, the way this feature works is by generating a type of white noise that cancels out external sounds, and this can cause the headphones to emit its own high pitch feedback. This feedback is typically at a frequency of around 2-3 kHz, which is a range that is particularly damaging to the inner ear.

So what can you do to protect your hearing while still enjoying your music? First and foremost, it's important to limit your exposure to high pitch feedback. If you hear any sharp or painful sounds, immediately turn your headphones down to a lower volume, or take a break from listening for a while. It's also crucial to ensure that your headphones are properly fitted or worn correctly, as this can also help reduce feedback.

Another solution is to invest in headphones or earbuds that use active noise cancellation technology, rather than generating white noise. Products like the Bose Quietcomfort 35 headphones or the Sony WH-1000XM4 offer the same noise-cancelling features, but without generating the same type of high pitch feedback.

Ultimately, protecting your hearing is crucial, and that means taking the necessary steps to ensure that your hearing is not damaged by high pitch feedback. If you use the Bose Quietcomfort 25 headphones, be sure to take care of your ears and minimize your exposure to this type of feedback. Remember, hearing damage is permanent, but it's entirely preventable.

 I get a high pitch squealing when I use my headphones - I have to wiggle them so they are not quite on my ears and it stops. When I move my head it intermittently screeches again. This has been happening for quite some time and I thought it was just me but have now seen other headphones have had similar questions I’m wondering if they are faulty. Any suggestions please ?
