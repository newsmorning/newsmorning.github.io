# You Won't Believe How This Simple Trick Fixes Your iPhone 6S Home Button Issue!

Are you tired of constantly struggling with the unresponsive home button on your iPhone 6S? Do you dread the thought of having to pay for expensive repairs, or worse still, buying a new phone altogether? Well, worry no more! We've got a simple trick that will fix your home button issue in no time, and without any costly repairs. 

So, what is this magical trick, you ask? It's simply cleaning your phone's home button. Yes, you read that right! The gunk, dirt, and dust that gets lodged into the tiny crevices around your home button could be the culprit behind your iPhone's unresponsiveness. Fortunately, cleaning it out takes nothing more than a few common household items and a bit of patience. 

First, gather everything you'll need for the process. You'll need a toothpick or needle, a small brush (like a soft-bristled toothbrush or makeup brush), and some rubbing alcohol. In a well-lit area, follow these simple steps: 

1. Turn off your iPhone and unplug it from any power source. 
2. Dip the toothpick or needle into the rubbing alcohol and gently insert it into the tiny crevices around the home button. Use a light touch to avoid damaging the button or surrounding area. 
3. Use the brush to sweep away any dirt or dust that the toothpick loosens. 
4. Repeat the process until you've cleaned all sides of the button. 
5. Wipe the button with a clean, dry cloth and let your iPhone sit for 10-15 minutes to allow any remaining alcohol to evaporate. 
6. Turn your phone back on and test the home button to see if it's working properly. 

If the home button still isn't responding, try repeating the process a few more times. In some cases, the most stubborn dirt or debris may require several cleanings to fully remove. 

Regardless of whether or not your iPhone's home button issue is fully resolved, cleaning it out is a simple and effective way to prolong the life of your device. It's also a great way to save money on repairs or replacements. So go ahead, give it a try and see if you too can fix your iPhone 6S home button issue with this simple trick!
