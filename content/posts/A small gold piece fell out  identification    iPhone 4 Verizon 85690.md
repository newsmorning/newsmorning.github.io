Have you ever wondered what could be lurking in your old devices? Well, one man found out the hard way. For years, he had held onto his trusty iPhone 4 Verizon, unaware of the treasure he had stored away. It wasn't until recently that he discovered a small object that could be worth gold.

Curiosity got the better of him, and he took it to a local specialist to identify the mystery object. What they found was nothing short of amazing. It turned out to be a rare and valuable coin from the turn of the 20th century.

The coin was a Liberty Head $5 Half Eagle from the year 1900, and it was in excellent condition. The specimen was unusual because typically, these coins would have been made of gold, which would have resulted in a very hefty sum. However, the coin in question was made of copper and nickel, which only increased its rarity.

The Liberty Head $5 Half Eagle was a significant piece of American currency. It was first minted in 1839 and continued until 1908, with various designs changing throughout its production. The coin got its name from the depiction of Lady Liberty on the front side and an eagle on the back. Its introduction marked the first time the US government authorized a $5 coin.

The Liberty Head $5 Half Eagle is a popular coin among collectors and can be valued at tens of thousands of dollars, depending on its condition, rarity, and age. With this particular specimen dating back over 120 years, it's no wonder it's worth a considerable sum.

For the owner of the coin, the discovery was nothing short of life-changing. He had no idea the device he held so dear contained a hidden treasure. He could have easily thrown it away, sold it for scrap or kept it as a forgotten relic. Instead, his curiosity led him to uncover a valuable piece of American history.

So, next time you come across an old device lying around in your house, have a second look, and make sure you're not sitting on a treasure trove like this lucky man. Who knows what you might find?
