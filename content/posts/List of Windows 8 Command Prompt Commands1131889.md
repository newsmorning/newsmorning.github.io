However, your Windows 8 computer has a lot more potential than you might think. By accessing some of the hidden Command Prompt commands, you can perform a range of advanced functions that can increase efficiency, speed up processes, and even troubleshoot problems. In this article, we'll explore 10 hidden Command Prompt commands that can help you get the most out of your Windows 8 computer.

Simply type "tasklist" into the Command Prompt and hit enter to see a list of all active processes, their process IDs, and the amount of memory each is using.

## 2. Ipconfig

By typing "ipconfig" into the Command Prompt, you'll receive information about your computer's IP address, DNS server, and default gateway, which can help you troubleshoot connectivity problems.

## 3. Ping

Ping is a Command Prompt command that enables you to test your network connectivity. By typing "ping" followed by an IP address or domain name, you can test the connection between your computer and that endpoint.

## 4. Telnet

The Command Prompt available in Windows 8 contains access to around 230 command line commands. These commands are used for a variety of purposes, including diagnosing and correcting certain Windows problems, automating tasks, and much more.

 
##   Availability of Command Prompt Commands  
 

A number of these commands are very similar to MS-DOS commands. However, the Command Prompt in Windows 8 is not MS-DOS, so the commands are not correctly referred to as MS-DOS commands. We do have this Complete List of MS-DOS Commands if you really are using MS-DOS and are interested.

 

Similarly, not all Command Prompt commands are carried over to new Windows operating systems as they are released. So while the CMD commands listed in the table below apply to Windows 8, some might not be available in Windows 11, or Windows XP, etc.

 

See our Command Availability Across Microsoft Operating Systems list for every command ever available, from MS-DOS through Windows 11. It clearly shows which versions of Windows supports which commands. We also have lists detailing commands that are specific to other versions of Windows: Windows 7 commands and Windows XP commands.
