If you’re a music lover or enjoy listening to podcasts, you know how important having a functioning pair of headphones is. However, sometimes things can go wrong, and your headphone jack can break. But don’t worry – replacing a broken 4 pole headphone jack is easier than you think. This DIY repair guide will walk you through the process.\nBefore we get started, we should clarify what a 4 pole headphone jack is. A 4 pole jack is used for headphones that have a built-in microphone, as it allows for both audio output and input. If your headphones have a microphone built-in, they likely have a 4 pole jack.\nYou’ll need a few tools to complete this repair:\nReplacement 4 pole headphone jack Soldering iron Soldering wire Wire cutters/strippers Heat shrink tubing Lighter or heat gun Step 1: Remove the broken jack\nThe first step is to remove the old, broken jack from your headphones. Using your wire cutters, snip the wires that connect the jack to the headphones. Make sure to leave enough wire so that you can connect your new jack easily. Once the old jack is removed, strip the ends of the wires to expose the metal.\nStep 2: Prepare the new jack\nTake your replacement 4 pole jack and prepare it for installation. Remove any casing or plastic, if necessary. Then, carefully loosen or remove the screws on the jack to expose the terminals.\nStep 3: Solder the wires\nYour old jack should have two or three wires, depending on its type. The new jack should have four terminals, one for each wire. The wires are typically color-coded, with one wire being red, one white or green, one blue or yellow, and one copper.\nSolder each wire to its corresponding terminal on the new jack. Be careful not to add too much solder, as this can cause a short circuit.\nStep 4: Insulate the wires\nOnce all of the wires are soldered, you’ll want to make sure they are properly insulated to prevent any short circuits from occurring. Use heat shrink tubing to cover each wire and terminal. Use a lighter or heat gun to heat the tubing and shrink it tightly around the wires.\nStep 5: Test your new jack\nWith the new jack installed and insulated, it’s time to test it out. Plug your headphones into a device that can play audio and make sure sound is coming through both ears. If everything checks out, congratulations – you’ve successfully replaced your 4 pole headphone jack!\nIn summary, replacing a broken 4 pole headphone jack can seem intimidating, but it’s a very doable DIY repair. All you need are a few tools and some basic soldering skills. Don’t let a broken headphone jack stop you from enjoying your music or podcasts – give this repair a try!\nDifficulty\nDifficult\nSteps\n10\nTime Required\n30 minutes - 1 hour Sections\n1\n4-Pole 3.5mm Jack 10 steps Flags\n0\nBackHeadphone\nFull Screen\nOptions\nHistory\nSave to Favorites\nDownload PDF\nEdit\nTranslate\nGet Shareable Link\nEmbed This Guide\nNotify Me of Changes\nStop Notifications\nIntroduction The use of a soldering iron is required in order to complete this repair. Since the wires used in headphones are often very small, this repair is only recommended for individuals with decent amount of experience in soldering.\nExtra precautions should be taken while using the soldering iron, they are extremely hot and you will be working in very small spaces.

Carefully apply a small amount of solder to hold the wire in place. Repeat this for each wire. Make sure to reference the mapping of wires to connection points that you created in Step 4. When soldering the wires, be patient and meticulous about getting the right position to make a good connection. If the internal wires do not have their own insulation, use a small bit of shrink tubing on each wire. This will prevent them from shorting across another wire.

They even differ among models of the same manufacturer. The only way is to test against the plug that is being replaced. Hopefully most wires still connect to the plug contacts, so a process of elimination can be used. Typical colors are red, blue, green and no color. Ground is usually no color, and sometimes there are 2 grounds (e.g. for ‘zipper’ style wires). The contacts for most phones are as follows (from tip to outside barrel): Right, Left, Ground, Mic. My Samsung S3 cord was very strange: red, green, no color and 2 black wires. One black was Ground, the other was MIC. Soldering requires a magnifier and a fine tipped iron.\nOld Liquid - Oct 4, 2018\nReply\nNo pinout, seriously?\n","wordCount":"1577","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ernest Talley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/4-pole-headphone-jack-replacement-repair-guide1937827/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You'll Never Believe How Easy it is to Replace Your Broken 4 Pole Headphone Jack - DIY Repair Guide!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 22, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1577 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ernest Talley</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#what-you-need>What you need</a></li><li><a href=#heading></a></li><li><a href=#heading-1></a></li><li><a href=#heading-2></a></li><li><a href=#heading-3></a></li><li><a href=#heading-4></a></li><li><a href=#heading-5></a></li><li><a href=#heading-6></a></li><li><a href=#heading-7></a></li><li><a href=#heading-8></a></li><li><a href=#heading-9></a><ul><li><a href=#heading-10></a></li><li><a href=#team>Team</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=youll-never-believe-how-easy-it-is-to-replace-your-broken-4-pole-headphone-jack---diy-repair-guide>You&rsquo;ll Never Believe How Easy it is to Replace Your Broken 4 Pole Headphone Jack - DIY Repair Guide!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#youll-never-believe-how-easy-it-is-to-replace-your-broken-4-pole-headphone-jack---diy-repair-guide>#</a></h1><p>If you&rsquo;re a music lover or enjoy listening to podcasts, you know how important having a functioning pair of headphones is.

Dec 14, 2017</p><p>Reply</p><p>Wire colors are not standardized. They even differ among models of the same manufacturer. The only way is to test against the plug that is being replaced. Hopefully most wires still connect to the plug contacts, so a process of elimination can be used. Typical colors are red, blue, green and no color. Ground is usually no color, and sometimes there are 2 grounds (e.g. for ‘zipper’ style wires). The contacts for most phones are as follows (from tip to outside barrel): Right, Left, Ground, Mic. My Samsung S3 cord was very strange: red, green, no color and 2 black wires. One black was Ground, the other was MIC. Soldering requires a magnifier and a fine tipped iron.</p><p>Old Liquid -
