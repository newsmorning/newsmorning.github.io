# Unlock the Secrets of Your Samsung Galaxy A50 with This Easy Broken Screen Fix!

A broken screen can be a real nightmare for anyone who owns a Samsung Galaxy A50. Not only does it make your phone less visually appealing, but it can also hinder your ability to use your device. Fortunately, there is an easy and cost-effective solution available that can help you unlock the secrets of your Samsung Galaxy A50. And that is none other than fixing the broken screen!

So, how do you fix a broken screen on your Samsung Galaxy A50? There are a few ways to go about it, but the easiest and most reliable method is to get it professionally fixed. You could try to fix it yourself, but that carries its fair share of risks. This is especially true if you have no prior experience in fixing phones. Here are the steps to take.

## Step 1: Look for a Reliable Repair Service

The first step in fixing a broken Samsung Galaxy A50 screen is to find a reliable repair service. With so many repair services available, it can be hard to choose one that is trustworthy and competent. To make sure you are getting the best service, you need to do your research. Look for customer reviews online, and ask for referrals from friends and family who may have had their screens fixed in the past.

## Step 2: Get a Quote

Once you find a repair service that you trust, the next step is to get a quote. This will give you an idea of how much it will cost to fix your broken screen. Keep in mind that the cost will vary depending on the extent of the damage as well as the type of repair service you choose.

## Step 3: Drop off Your Phone for Repair

If you are happy with the quote and the service provider, it's time to drop off your phone for repair. The repair technician will examine your device to determine the extent of the damage and give you an estimate on how long the repair will take. Depending on the severity of the damage, the entire process could take anywhere between a few hours to several days.

## Step 4: Pick Up Your Phone and Enjoy the Results

Once your phone is fixed, it's time to pick it up and start enjoying all the features of your Samsung Galaxy A50 once again. A fixed phone not only makes it easier to use, but it also prolongs its lifespan. Plus, you won't have to worry about the cost of replacing the entire device.

In conclusion, a broken screen on your Samsung Galaxy A50 doesn't have to be a nightmare. With a reliable repair service, you can unlock the secrets of your phone and start enjoying all the features once more. All you have to do is follow the steps above, and you will have a fully functioning phone in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 The phone is running and is connected to Wifi but USB debugging is not enable.
Is there another to access it. I can access the battery percentage on my Samsung Account (Find my phone).
Will be really grateful if can help. I can also connect a USB mouse to phone through USB-C type dongle.
Thank you very much.

 @ashvinp … to manually enable usb debugging do this:
go to settings/general/about phone/software info/ tap on build number until it prompts for developer mode.
go back to settings/general/ youll have a new menu for developer options/ turn on developer options/ turn on usb debugging.
if youre doing this for root, make sure to enable oem unlock so that you can use adb to access root partitions such as bootloader …yada yada.
as far as viewing your screen if it unviewable, you can try a mini usb to hdmi adapter or something of the sorts to try and navigate. other than that, theres nothing i am aware of without being able to navigate your screen already. good luck
