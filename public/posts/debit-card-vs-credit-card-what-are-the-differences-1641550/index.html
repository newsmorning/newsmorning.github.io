Discover the Shocking Differences Between Debit and Credit Cards! As we go about our daily lives, most of us have probably used both debit and credit cards for various purchases. But have you ever stopped to think about the differences between these two types of cards and whether you could be using the wrong one?\nHere are some of the key differences between debit and credit cards, and why it matters which one you use:\nHow They Work Debit cards are linked directly to your checking or savings account, which means the funds for your purchase are taken out of your account immediately. Credit cards, on the other hand, allow you to borrow money from a lender (usually a bank) to make your purchase. You then pay back the amount borrowed plus interest over time.\nInterest Rates Speaking of interest, this is one of the biggest differences between debit and credit cards. Debit cards usually don’t charge any interest because you’re using your own money. Credit cards, however, can come with high interest rates (sometimes as much as 20% or more) if you don’t pay off the balance in full each month.\nRewards Programs Many credit cards offer rewards programs that give you points or cash back for every dollar you spend. Debit cards, on the other hand, typically don’t offer rewards programs.\nSecurity If someone steals your debit card and uses it for fraudulent purchases, the money is immediately taken out of your account. It can take some time to get that money back, which can be frustrating and cause financial hardship. With a credit card, you’re not liable for fraudulent charges and the bank will investigate and resolve the issue.\nBuilding Credit Using a credit card responsibly (i.e. paying off the balance in full and on time each month) can help you build your credit score. This can be important if you plan to borrow money in the future for things like a car or mortgage. With a debit card, there’s no opportunity to build credit.\nBudgeting Because debit cards withdraw money directly from your account, they can be a helpful tool for sticking to a budget. You can only spend what you have. Credit cards, on the other hand, can be tempting to use for impulse purchases or when you don’t have the money on hand. This can lead to overspending and debt.\nWhich One Should You Use? It all depends on your financial situation and goals. If you have trouble controlling your spending or tend to carry a balance from month to month, a debit card might be a better option. If you’re good at managing your finances and want the benefits of rewards programs and building credit, a credit card could be a better fit.\nThe bottom line is that both debit and credit cards have their pros and cons. The key is to understand those differences and choose the card that works best for you.\nSo the next time you pull out your wallet to make a purchase, take a moment to consider which card you’re using and why. It could make a big difference in your financial future.\nYou most likely are already aware that there are two major categories of cards that are issued by financial institutions to customers but you are almost always confused by the differences between both cards. In terms of physical appearance, both debit cards and credit cards look exactly alike and have similar characteristics and form: 16-digit card numbers, expiration dates, card verification value (CVV) number, issuer/company logo, PIN codes, etc.\nDespite their similarities, however, both debit and credit cards are different in terms of spending/withdrawal behavior, use cases, and purposes. Do you get confused when you hear debit and credit cards mentioned in the bank, retails stores or anywhere at all? I’m pretty sure you’re not alone. You should continue reading to find out the differences between both cards.\nDebit card As mentioned earlier, a debit card looks exactly like a credit card. The difference, however, is that debit cards are issued by banks or other financial institutions to customers solely for the purposes of remotely accessing funds in their accounts without having to visit the banks. Say you have $500 in your acct at Bank XYZ, with a debit card, you can access/withdraw the $500 at any time or use it pay for goods and services online or offline without having to visit the bank.\nCustomers/holders of debit cards are placed on a “Pay first, enjoy later” system where the bank (or card issuer) places a hold on whatever amount you spend on the card and immediately deducts it from the account linked to the card. Some institutions could delay deduction for as long as 24 hours or beyond.\nIf you try to purchase an item or withdraw cash using your debit card without having money in your account, your card will be declined at the point of transaction and an “insufficient funds” error will be displayed. Otherwise, there’s no limit to the amount you can spend or withdraw using a debit card.\nCredit cards Compared to debit card, credit card is more than just a plastic card but rather, a financial instrument. Unlike debit cards where you need to have sufficient funds in your account to perform any withdrawal, purchase, or payment, credit card enables customers pay for items and services without having money in their account.\nCredit cards are majorly issued by banks to customers based on terms agreed upon by both parties. Armed with a credit card, a consumer pay for services with money borrowed from the card issuer (i.e. bank) up to a certain limit. For clarity, with a credit card, you can pay for a $1,000 smartphone at a gadgets store without having the $1,000. When you swipe your card at the store, you are basically borrowing $1,000 from the bank/credit card company to pay the phone store.\nYou can use a credit card for multiple transactions without having a dime in your account; your credit card company/bank will front you the payment upfront but eventually, you will have to pay back the amount spent with a specified interest, at a specified time.\nCredit card holders are serviced by institutions on a “Buy now, pay later” model. The bank loans you money based on your line of credit. Line of credit (also called Credit Limit) basically refers to the maximum amount you can spend using the card. Once you hit your credit limit, further transactions will be declined. Usually, the credit limit depends on factors such as monthly income as well as credit history. The higher these factors are, the higher the credit limit the bank places on your credit card.\nConclusively, you should also know that at the end of every month, the bank or credit card company sends a bill or detail of money spent on your credit card and you’re expected to repay a minimum amount (as specified by the bank) or everything in full.\nCash Withdrawals Another difference between debit and credit cards is that you can withdraw cash from ATMs using any debit card. As long as you have enough funds in your bank account, you can withdraw cash whenever you like using a debit card. The case isn’t the same with credit cards.\nSome card issuer and financial institutions do not allow cardholders and customers withdraw cash using credit cards. Those whose credit cards support cash withdrawals charge extras fees when customers use their cards for such purposes.\nApplication Process When you open a new account in a bank, you are automatically qualified for a debit card. In most cases, the bank creates a debit card for your account and mails it to you. For credit cards, an application has to be made at the institution. And depending on the bank or company, credit card application could be filled online while some banks would require your physical presence.\nAs soon as you submit an application, the bank or credit card company will perform a “credit and income” check on you and will either accept or decline your request.\nConclusion To summarize it all, both credit and debit cards can be used for both personal and business purposes. Likewise, they can both be used to pay for goods and services (online and offline) at any point of payment where cards are accepted as a form of payments. The major difference between a credit card and debit card, however, is that the former uses borrowed money to pay for stuff while the latter uses money the holder owns.\nRelated ","wordCount":"1439","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lawrence Evans"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/debit-card-vs-credit-card-what-are-the-differences-1641550/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Are You Using The WRONG Card?
