In the world of computing, Dell and Microsoft are two of the most well-known brands worldwide. They have been fighting for supremacy in the technology world for years, with their latest battle being fought in the realm of desktops. Dell has recently launched a new product called the Smart Workspace Canvas, which many believe may be the Surface Studio killer we've been waiting for. In this article, we will explore this claim and provide an in-depth analysis of Dell's latest offering.

Firstly, let's take a look at what the Smart Workspace Canvas offers. The Canvas is a new all-in-one workstation that comes with an interactive display and a set of accessories that allow users to use it as a powerful creative tool. The Canvas offers a large 27-inch Ultra HD touchscreen display that can tilt up to 20 degrees, which allows for a comfortable working angle. It also comes with a wide array of connectivity options, including HDMI, USB 3.0, Ethernet, and Thunderbolt 3. Additionally, it supports a wide range of peripherals, including a precision dial, keyboard, and mouse.

In terms of performance, the Canvas is powered by an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM, which should be more than capable of handling most tasks with ease. It also features a powerful NVIDIA Quadro P3000 graphics card, making it ideal for video editing, CAD work, and other graphically intensive tasks.

So far, the Smart Workspace Canvas sounds like a pretty impressive machine. But, how does it compare to the Surface Studio? The Surface Studio is Microsoft's all-in-one PC, which has been the market leader in this segment for a while now. It features a 28-inch PixelSense display, an Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card. It also comes with a nifty accessory called the Surface Dial, which allows users to interact with the screen in a unique way.

When we compare the two, there are a few areas where the Smart Workspace Canvas outshines the Surface Studio. The first is price; the Canvas is significantly cheaper than the Surface Studio, coming in at around $2,000, compared to the Surface Studio's starting price of $3,499. The Canvas also comes with a more powerful graphics card, making it great for serious users who require heavy-duty graphics power. Furthermore, the Canvas has a better tilt mechanism, allowing the screen to be angled up to 20 degrees, whereas the Surface Studio only tilts up to 20 degrees.

However, there are a few areas where the Surface Studio is still ahead of the Smart Workspace Canvas. One of these is the screen size, with the Surface Studio's 28-inch PixelSense display being slightly larger than the Canvas's 27-inch screen. Additionally, the Surface Studio's accessory, the Surface Dial, is a unique tool that can greatly enhance the user's creative experience.

In conclusion, while the Smart Workspace Canvas is an impressive machine, it is still too early to say whether it will be the Surface Studio killer we've been waiting for. Depending on your specific requirements, both machines have their strengths and weaknesses. However, if you are looking for a powerful and versatile all-in-one PC at a reasonable price, the Smart Workspace Canvas is definitely worth considering.

Microsoft designed its all-in-one Surface Studio with an innovative design that lets you fold the PC into a sloped drafting surface from an upright monitor. Now, Dell has mimicked that same idea to produce Canvas, a 27-inch Windows 10 smart workspace unveiled at the CES 2017.
 
While the Dell Canvas may not have all the features of an all-in-one PC, it’s meant to pair with a large display through an interactive capacitive screen. The workspace includes a puck-like control hardware called Totem, which allows you to control programs by pulling up a circular menu once you place it on the screen. The peripheral uses the same code that Microsoft’s Surface Dial taps into to integrate with any application. However, not too many apps work with these controllers at present, chief of which is Adobe’s Creative Suite.
 
Dell baked custom software into the Canvas to allow apps to be pinned to various corners of the display. While it’s a less notable feature, the software enables you to better manage programs on a large screen such as the Canvas.
 
The Canvas display is only an inch smaller than the Surface Studio, but the device looks a bit larger due to its protruding bezels. While the bezels can be clunky as they stick out beyond the edges of Canvas, they can help you keep your hands off the screen. The bezels also incorporate a magnetic strip with which you can hang a loose stylus. It also comes with a kickstand that props up the monitor in a 45-degree viewing angle.
 
Compared to Surface Studio’s 4500 x 3000-resolution screen resolution, Canvas comes in with a less sharp display which boasts only 2560 x 1440. Dell explains that the low resolution enables the monitor to work more seamlessly with a number of computers since graphics chips will be able to pump more power into your current creation than into the display. No matter the excuse, Canvas still pales in comparison with the Surface Studio in that regard
 
Dell has yet to announce pricing for the Canvas. Shipment for the workspace monitor will commence in April of this year.
