Deezer Music Preview has recently received important updates, including lyrics support, song recommendation, and bug fixes. Deezer Music Preview UWP app first became available in the Microsoft Store in March and received the first update in April.
 
The lyrics feature has long been available on the Android and iOS versions of the app, while Windows users had to wait a bit longer to get it. This should come as no surprise since the Windows Mobile platform is usually the last to receive app updates and support.
 
If you want to activate the lyrics feature, all you have to do is select the microphone icon and the lyrics will appear. Recommendations are also available, with Deezer collecting information about your music preferences the moment you launch the app. If you use Deezer on your computer, you now have one extra-feature, allowing you to keep your guilty pleasure secret. You can mute the app if you click the speaker icon.
Deezer lets you access more than 35 million tracks so that you listen to your favorite artists and songs everywhere you go.  You can create as many playlists as possible, and you can add the songs you just discovered to your “Keep it on repeat” playlist. With Deezer Premium +, you can download your favorite music for offline listening.
 
The buttons Home, My Music, Audio Player, Notifications and Search let you access your music more easily. You can also put all your favorite songs, playlists, and artists in one place thanks to My Music.
 
Users love this app, and some even gave up using well-known apps such as Spotify:
 

 
Speaking of music apps, check out Microsoft’s Groove Music, another great UWP music app that allows you to control your music right from your Windows 10 Lock Screen among other interesting features.
 
I think I will be using Deezer instead Spotify because of this app. App must be half transparent tile like Instagram, that would be awesome.
