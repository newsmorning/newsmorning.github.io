The secret to this strategy is Inflation Accounting, a technique used by savvy investors who know how to beat the system.

What is Inflation Accounting?

Inflation Accounting is a technique used by investors to account for the effects of inflation on their investments. It involves adjusting the reported financial statements of companies to reflect the inflation rate. Inflation Accounting is a powerful tool for investors who want to stay ahead of inflation and maximize their returns.

How does Inflation Accounting Work?

Inflation Accounting works by adjusting the reported financial statements of companies to reflect the true value of their assets and liabilities. This is done by using a price index that measures the inflation rate. The price index is used to adjust the reported figures for assets and liabilities, as well as revenue and expenses.

By using Inflation Accounting, investors can gain a better understanding of the true value of a company's assets and liabilities. They can also see how changes in the inflation rate can affect the company's financial performance. This information is invaluable for making investment decisions.

How to Double Your Money Overnight with Inflation Accounting

Now that you understand what Inflation Accounting is and how it works, let's talk about how you can use it to double your money overnight. The key to doubling your money with Inflation Accounting is to find companies that are undervalued because of inflation.

When the inflation rate is high, companies with fixed assets, such as real estate or factories, may be undervalued on their financial statements. This is because the reported value of their assets does not reflect the true value in today's dollars. By using Inflation Accounting to adjust the reported figures, investors can see the true value of these assets and make investment decisions based on this information.

Investors can also use Inflation Accounting to identify companies with inflated revenues or expenses. When the inflation rate is high, companies may be reporting inflated revenues and expenses due to the effects of inflation. By using Inflation Accounting to adjust the reported figures, investors can see the true financial performance of the company and make investment decisions based on this information.

Conclusion

Inflation Accounting is a powerful tool for investors who want to stay ahead of inflation and maximize their returns. By adjusting the reported financial statements of companies to reflect the effects of inflation, investors can gain a better understanding of the true value of a company's assets and liabilities. They can also see how changes in the inflation rate can affect the company's financial performance. By using Inflation Accounting to identify undervalued companies, investors can double their money overnight. So, if you want to beat the system and maximize your returns, Inflation Accounting is the way to go!

#### #1 – Current Purchasing Power
 
Under this method, the monetary and the non-monetary items are separated so that monetary items record only a net gain or loss. At the same time, the non-monetary items are updated into figures with a particular conversion factor that is equivalent to a specific price indexIndexIndexation is a method of adjusting the purchase price of an investment (bonds, debentures, or any other asset class) to account for the effect of inflation over the investment term, lowering the capital gain and reducing taxable income.read more.
 
Conversion Factor under CPP Method = Price at Current Period / Price at the Historical Period
 
#### #2 – Current Cost Accounting
 
Under this method, the assets are valued at fair market value (FMV) rather than their historical cost during the fixed assetFixed AssetFixed assets are assets that are held for the long term and are not expected to be converted into cash in a short period of time.

### How Does Inflation Accounting Work?
 
#### Example 1
 
Let us consider an illustration where Mr. John purchased equipment on 1st January 2012 for $50,000. As of that day, the Consumer Price IndexConsumer Price IndexThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average price of a basket of regularly used consumer commodities compared to a base year. The CPI for the base year is 100, and this is the benchmark  point.read more stood at 150, whereas it reflects 300 as of 1st January 2019. Due to this, we are now required to reflect the revalued value of the equipment under the CPP method.
 
The details are summarised as follows: –
 
Applying the conversion factor formula,
 
Conversion factor under CPP method = Price at Current Period / Price at the Historical Period
 
(300/150=2)
 
Hence, the revaluation of the equipment under the CPP method stands at $25,000 ($50,000/2).
 
#### Example 2
 
From the below-given data, compute the net monetary gain or loss per the CPP method.
 
Solution:
 
Monetary gain on holding liabilities:
 
- Monetary gain on holding liabilities = ₹86,250 – ₹60,000

 
= ₹26,250.
 
Where, value as per closing balance sheetBalance SheetA balance sheet is one of the financial statements of a company that presents the shareholders' equity, liabilities, and assets of the company at a specific point in time. It is based on the accounting equation that states that the sum of the total liabilities and the owner's capital equals the total assets of the company.read more = Credits + Public Deposits = ₹60,000
 
Monetary loss on holding a monetary asset
 
- Monetary loss on holding monetary asset = ₹70,125 – ₹49,500

 
= ₹20,625.
 
The calculation of net monetary gain is as follows:
 
- Net Monetary gain = ₹26,250 – ₹20,625

 
= ₹5,625.
 
### Advantages
