The Januss is a tablet and a laptop combined, making it perfect for people who need versatility and portability in their device. 

Windows 10 on ARM technology allows the Januss to have a longer battery life and run more efficiently than traditional CPUs. This means that you can use the Januss for longer periods without worrying about running out of battery or recharging it. It also means that you can run more applications on the Januss without it slowing down or freezing.

The Januss is also equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 chipset, which is designed specifically for Windows 10 on ARM, providing better performance and efficiency. It has a 12.3-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS touchscreen display, which is vibrant and clear, making it perfect for both work and entertainment.

Now, let's talk about the design. The Januss is sleek and lightweight, weighing only 1.9 pounds.

You can easily convert the device from a tablet to a laptop with its detachable keyboard, giving you the flexibility to use it however you want.

Another great feature of the Januss is its security. It has Windows Hello facial recognition, which adds another layer of security to your device. Windows Hello uses facial recognition to authenticate and unlock your device, making it more secure than traditional passwords.

In conclusion, Dell's Januss is a game-changing device that is revolutionizing the way we use technology.

If you thought that Microsoft is the only tech giant interested in foldable devices, guess again because the tech company is not the only manufacturer that’s exploring the development of a foldable device running Windows 10. Samsung and Huawei are also on the verge of launching a foldable smartphone in the near future, and more recently, rumors claim that Dell could also launch something similar to Microsoft’s device running on Andromeda.
 
### Dell’s dual-screen system is codenamed Januss
 
Januss is a reference to the Roman god which had two faces. Dell’s dual-screen device could be powered by a brand new processor manufactured by Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 850.
 
This device running Windows 10 seems to have been in the works since the summer of 2017. Unfortunately, details regarding design and features are not available at the moment.
 
### Microsoft’s Andromeda device popped up in more patents
 
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated more than once in the past that the tech giant was working on a revolutionary device and the Andromeda gadget could be the one. It still remains to be seen whether Redmond will apply the same strategy that it used for the original Surface line for the new device category.
 
The strategy we’re referring to involves creating a reference device to inspire more OEMs to do the same thing even better. One example that worked out successfully is the Surface Pro running Windows 8. On the other hand, PC OEMs have ditched Windows RT and so did Microsoft after the Surface 2.
 
Creating a new device category can be quite a challenging thing, and wearables are the best example. We still have to wait some more to see whether Microsoft and the company’s partners will be able to make a foldable device and if such devices would have the ability to replace our smartphones.
