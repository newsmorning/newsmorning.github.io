## Chosen Solution
 Hi everyone,
Macbook suddenly died - black screen and no keyboard backlight. Brought it to Apple to fix under consumer law, they agreed but then they came with this assessment:
There is damage resulting from liquid contact in the main logic board that is not covered by Apple's Limited Warranty, an AppleCare plan, consumer law, or the original quoted cost of the repair.
MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, 2 TBT3)
Cost of repair 969£ + VAT
This laptop is extremely problematic and I had the logic board repaired twice already!!! (once apple did it for free and once I had to pay to a third party.
I don’t recall any contact with the water. Could you please confirm whether you can certainly tell by a picture that this is water damage? (Otherwise, I will carry on with trying to ask Apple to repair it for free)

 Sadly the image is not clear enough to tell. All I see is a blurry fuzz which could be a small dust bunny.
Spilled drinks are not the only way one can encounter liquid damage!
Just like your windows or mirror fog up when you have a nice hot shower the level of humidity within the bathroom can condense on the cooler surface which can also be inside your system!
So if you live in a humid environment and are moving between the air conditioned home or office to the humid outside then you can encounter condensation damage!
