# Never Pay for a Tail Light Repair Again with This Easy 2017 Honda Accord Sedan Guide!

If you own a 2017 Honda Accord Sedan, you know how important it is to keep your car in good condition. One of the most common issues with this car is a broken tail light. It can be frustrating to have to go to a mechanic and spend hundreds of dollars to fix it. But did you know that you can easily do it yourself? This guide will show you how to replace the tail light on your Honda Accord Sedan quickly and easily.

## Step 1: Get the Right Parts

The first thing you need to do is get the right parts. You will need a replacement tail light for your Honda Accord Sedan. You can find these parts at any auto parts store, or you can order them online. Make sure you get the right one for your car's make and model.

## Step 2: Remove the Old Tail Light

Once you have the new tail light, it's time to remove the old one. Start by opening the trunk of your Honda Accord Sedan. Locate the tail light that needs to be replaced. Remove the plastic cover that is covering the tail light. You can do this by either pulling it off or by unscrewing it using a screwdriver.

## Step 3: Disconnect the Wiring

Next, you need to disconnect the wiring that is attached to the tail light. Locate the connector and push down on the tabs to release it. Once it's disconnected, you should be able to remove the old tail light completely.

## Step 4: Install the New Tail Light

Now it's time to install the new tail light. Simply reverse the steps you took to remove the old one. Connect the wiring to the new tail light and place it back into position. Once it's lined up, you can screw or snap the plastic cover back into place.

## Step 5: Test the New Tail Light

Once you have installed the new tail light, it's important to test it. Have someone stand behind the car and press the brake pedal. The new tail light should light up just like the other one. If it doesn't, you may need to check the wiring or consult a mechanic.

In conclusion, replacing a tail light on a 2017 Honda Accord Sedan is a simple process that you can easily do yourself. Save yourself the hassle and expense of going to a mechanic and do it on your own. With this guide, you can have your car looking and functioning like new again in no time!
