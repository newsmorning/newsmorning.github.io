Title: Warning: Li Poly Battery in iPod Touch 2nd Gen poses dangerous puncture risk!

Introduction:
The iPod Touch 2nd Gen is a popular device, loved by many for its sleek design and impressive features. However, as with any electronic device, there are risks associated with its use. One of the most significant dangers of this device is the Li Poly battery it contains, which poses a significant puncture risk.

Body:
Li Poly batteries are known to be volatile and prone to exploding, and this is a potential hazard for the users of iPod Touch 2nd Gen. This means that if the battery is punctured or damaged, it could catch fire or explode, causing serious harm to anyone nearby.

There are many different scenarios in which the battery in an iPod Touch 2nd Gen could become compromised. For example, if the device is dropped or knocked against a hard surface, the battery could sustain damage that ultimately leads to it puncturing. Similarly, if the device is exposed to extreme temperatures or subjected to excessive pressure, the battery could become damaged.

It is essential that users of this device take steps to minimize the risk of puncturing the Li Poly battery. This includes being careful not to drop or jostle the device, avoiding exposing it to extreme temperatures, and never attempting to open or tamper with the battery.

If the battery in your iPod Touch 2nd Gen does become punctured, it is crucial to take immediate action. First, disconnect the device from its power source and move it to a safe location. Then, contact a professional to handle the situation, as attempting to repair a punctured battery yourself can be extremely dangerous.

Conclusion:
Overall, while the iPod Touch 2nd Gen is undoubtedly an innovative and useful device, its Li Poly battery does pose a significant risk to users. By taking simple precautions to minimize the risk of puncturing the battery and knowing what to do in the event of a puncture, users can continue to enjoy the device without putting themselves or others in harm's way. It is essential to remember that safety should always be the top priority when using electronic devices such as the iPod Touch 2nd Gen.

## Chosen Solution
 Took apart my sisters ipod touch 2g... (replacing the screen). Took the battery off with a small metal, screwdriver and the battery got a bit marred ("streaks" on the back where adhesive was)
But I might have a small puncture in the plastic of the battery (1/64 inch)
The plastic is also very slightly puffed up around the batt, just like it got pulled a little by the adhesive
Should I be concerned? I slapped some Electrical tape on it and around the tiny puncture...

 Thomas, yes you should be concerned. If a battery's outer case is punctured, the lithium inside is highly volatile and will react violently with water, this includes humidity in any room. You are now running risk of fire and explosion. Replace the battery immediately and dispose of the broken one. Stay safe, good luck.
