Say Goodbye to Your League of Legends Woes: Learn the Secret to Fixing Error 004 Once and for All!

Are you tired of encountering Error 004 every time you play League of Legends? Do you wish there was a permanent solution to this frustrating issue? Well, you are in luck! In this article, we will discuss the secret to fixing Error 004 and finally putting an end to your League of Legends woes.

First and foremost, let us understand what Error 004 actually is. Error 004 is a common error that players encounter while launching League of Legends. It occurs when the client tries to connect to the server but fails to do so due to a network or firewall issue.

Now, here comes the secret that will finally put an end to your Error 004 woes - port forwarding. Port forwarding is a process that allows your computer to communicate with League of Legends' servers by opening certain ports that are necessary for the game's smooth functioning.

To begin the port forwarding process, you need to first access your router's settings. You can do this by typing your router's IP address in your web browser. Once you have accessed your router's settings, you need to locate the 'Port Forwarding' or 'Virtual Server' option.

Next, you need to add League of Legends to the list of port forwarding applications. To do this, you need to enter the specific ports that League of Legends requires. The ports that need to be opened are 5000-5500 TCP, 8393-8400 TCP, and 2099 TCP. Once you have entered these ports, save the changes and restart your router.

After completing the port forwarding process, launch League of Legends and check if Error 004 still persists. If the error is no longer present, then congratulations, you have successfully fixed it using port forwarding.

In case the error still persists, you can try temporarily disabling your firewall and then launching League of Legends. If the game launches successfully without Error 004, then it means that your firewall is the culprit. In such a case, you need to add League of Legends to your firewall's exception list and then enable the firewall again.

In conclusion, Error 004 can be a frustrating issue that impedes your smooth League of Legends experience. However, with the secret of port forwarding, you can finally put an end to all your Error 004 woes. Just remember to follow the steps correctly, and soon you will be able to enjoy your game without any network connectivity issues. Happy gaming!
