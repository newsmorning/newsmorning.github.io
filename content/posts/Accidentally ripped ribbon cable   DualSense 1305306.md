Recently, a video was circulated on social media that shocked PlayStation 5 fans. The video showed a PS5 Dualsense Controller being destroyed in the most unusual way. The video went viral within a few hours of being posted, and PlayStation fans were left bewildered and in disbelief.

The video shows a person holding a PS5 Dualsense Controller and then proceeds to crush the controller using an industrial hydraulic press. The controller gets smashed, and the pieces scatter all over the place. It is an astonishing sight to see the sturdy and robust controller getting destroyed in seconds.

The internet has been ablaze with discussions on why someone would destroy a brand new PS5 Dualsense Controller. Some people theorized that it could be a publicity stunt for an upcoming game. Others guessed that it could be a test to see how durable the controller really is.

Sony has not commented on this incident, so we don't have any official information on why anyone would do such a thing. However, we can safely assume that the Dualsense Controllers are not meant to be put through such extreme pressure.

The PS5 Dualsense Controller was touted as one of the most advanced controllers ever made. Its features, including haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and motion sensing technology, were intended to provide a more immersive gaming experience. The controller's build quality was also praised for its robustness and sturdiness.

However, this destructive video has left many people questioning the durability of the controller. Some are even questioning if the controller is worth its high price tag.

It's important to note that the PS5 Dualsense Controller is not designed to withstand such extreme pressure. It's meant to be used for gaming purposes only, and care should be taken to ensure that it's used correctly.

In conclusion, the destruction of the PS5 Dualsense Controller is an unfortunate incident. It's a reminder that even the most advanced technology needs to be handled with care. We hope that this incident will not discourage gamers from using the Dualsense Controller to its full potential. Let's continue to enjoy the latest and most advanced gaming technology, but let's also be mindful of how we treat it.

## Chosen Solution
 While attempting to fix some analog drift on my PS5 DualSense controller, when I was taking it apart, I accidentally ripped the left haptic trigger ribbon cable. Is there somewhere that I could buy a replacement?

 unfortunately I cannot find any ANYWHERE  for sale. The one site I did find is overseas and no longer in stock. Best I could say is find a broken controller for parts. Still so new that parts are still not n widely available.

 The ps5 ribbon cable is now available. check egamephone on Google.

 You can find them on AliExpress now. $17 dollars Canadian.
