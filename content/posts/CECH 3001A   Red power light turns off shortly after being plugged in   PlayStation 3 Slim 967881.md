# You Won't Believe What's Happening to the Cech 3001A Red Power Light on Your Playstation 3 Slim!

The Playstation 3 Slim was a game-changing console when it was released in 2009. It featured groundbreaking technology and powerful hardware that made it one of the most popular gaming devices of its time. However, like any piece of technology, it is not immune to faults and issues. In particular, one of the most common issues that users face is related to the red power light on the Cech 3001A model. 

This red power light, located on the front of your PS3 Slim, is essential for powering up your console. When you press the power button, the light should turn green, indicating that the console is ready to use. However, many users have reported that their red power light on the Cech 3001A is not functioning correctly. 

The problem is widespread, and it is not limited to a particular user or region. The symptoms are similar across the board: when you press the power button, the light flashes red for a split second then turns off. This problem is not only frustrating but also renders the console useless. 

The root cause of the problem is a system error that occurs when the console is turned off improperly. Improper shutdowns can cause the system files to become corrupted or damaged, leading to issues with the red power light on the Cech 3001A. It means that the console is unable to boot up correctly from standby mode, causing the power light to blink red. 

Fortunately, there is a relatively simple solution to this problem. The first step is to disconnect the power supply from the back of your console and wait for 30 seconds. After that, plug the power supply back in and press and hold the power button for seven seconds or until you hear an audible beep. This process will initiate a "safe mode" boot-up process that will repair any system errors or corrupted files. 

In conclusion, the red power light issue on the Cech 3001A model of the Playstation 3 Slim is a common problem that many users have experienced. It is caused by an improper shutdown that results in system errors, preventing the console from booting up correctly from standby mode. Luckily, the solution is simple: resetting the console in safe mode will correct the issue and allow you to use your console once again.

## Chosen Solution
 My problem was originally as such:
I plug in the PS3.The red power light turns on.I press the power button. The PS3 beeps.The fan spins up; the power light turns green.After a few moments, both the fan and the power light turn off. Pressing the power button does nothing. I have to unplug the machine and leave it for some time in order to get the power light to glow again, and still I’m unable to power it on.
So I opened up the PS3, cleaned out the dust, and poked around the power supply (as I read that could be the issue). That didn’t help, so I tried using an ATX PSU to power the PlayStation. I still had the same issue as above, except when the fan and power light turned off, I was able to press the power button again to get the power light to turn back on to red.
I don’t recall exactly what I did, but at some point, my issue changed to the following:
I plug in the PS3.The red power light turns on.After a few moments, the power light turns off. I don’t have a chance to attempt to turn it on. As above, pressing the power button does nothing, and I have to leave the machine unplugged for a bit to get it to light up again.
Trying to use an ATX PSU after this would still have the same effect; the power light would turn off when I try to power it on, then back on when I press it again afterwards.
So I threw the PS3’s logic board in the oven at 380 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes, in a sorrowful attempt to reflow the board. After reassembling the machine, I ran into the same issue as directly above — once. I haven’t gotten the power light to turn on since then.
Note that I’ve tested the machine with another PSU, and still ran into the same issue. I’ve also tested the PSU in another PlayStation, which turned on just fine (well, this machine actually has the YLoD, but that’s because I messed up the NOR flash… long story). I’ve also tested multiple power cables with multiple outlets, of course.
Any help would be much appreciated. Feel free to ask me to clarify anything.
EDIT: The other PSU I tested the CECH-3001A with was from a CECH-2001B, which I now realize may have been a bad idea.

 Just wondering if there is a reset on power supply board or motherboard. I remember one on ps1
