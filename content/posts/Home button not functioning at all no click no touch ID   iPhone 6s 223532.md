Title: You Won't Believe What's Happening to iPhone 6S Home Buttons - No Click, No Touch ID!

Introduction:

The iPhone 6S is still used by millions of people worldwide, but recently, an alarming number of users have reported issues with their home buttons. The home button is a crucial component of the iPhone, acting as the primary way to navigate the device and access its features. However, users are now encountering problems where the home button either doesn't click or cannot be used to unlock the device with Touch ID. In this article, we will explore the causes and solutions for this issue.

Causes:

The primary cause of the iPhone 6S home button issue is thought to be faulty hardware. Specifically, the issue appears to affect users who have replaced the home button of their device with a non-original component. The problem may also arise due to wear and tear over time, as well as environmental factors like exposure to moisture and humidity can also damage the home button's wiring.

Solutions:

If your iPhone 6S home button is not clicking or the Touch ID is not working, there are a few solutions that you could try. Firstly, you can try a soft reset of your device by pressing and holding the Home button and power button simultaneously until the Apple logo appears. This has been known to resolve temporary software-related issues with the home button.

If the soft reset doesn't work, you can try cleaning your home button with a small amount of rubbing alcohol or contact cleaner. It's important to be extremely careful when doing this, as too much liquid can damage your device. You can also try resetting your device's settings, which might help if there are any software conflicts causing the issue.

However, if these remedies don't work, it's important to take your device to a trusted and certified repair center. They will be able to diagnose the issue correctly and fix the problem with genuine Apple parts.

Conclusion:

The home button issue plaguing iPhone 6S users might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it can impede the functionality of the device. It's essential to keep your device in excellent condition, especially if you rely on it daily. If you're experiencing problems with your home button, try the solutions mentioned in this article. If none of these work, take your device to a professional repair center for a reliable and long-lasting fix.

## Chosen Solution
 I’ve been searching page upon page of information relative to this issue but all i seem to find is home button flex issues this is not my issue.
I had a charging issue related to tristar that worked great now charges fine but at 0.5A which is not ideal but testing with a new port brings that into normal range of 0.9A-1.0A
However after i did this work i now have a non functioning home button (tested several different screens and buttons) Tried a hard reset and still not functioning.
I have opened boardview and if i am not wrong J4100 is responsible for the home button on PP3V0_MESA_CONN? I may have this wrong as mentioned i have come up blank on what circuit is responsible for the home button functionality.
Any guidance here would be vastly appreciated as before i replaced tristar the home button functioned as intended. I did knock L4522, L4521 around a little but replaced them. Anything else in that region that may be the culprit for my error?
Thanks.

 Solved - Sadly a tear in the flex near the connector of the screen for the home button is torn. I had not noticed this before but after double checking under the microscope there it was. And it is right on the bend of the flex so a repair is probably out of the question to get Touch ID back.
Be careful with these flexes they tear super easy i don’t even know how i did this since i was extremely careful and have done quite a few with no issues.
