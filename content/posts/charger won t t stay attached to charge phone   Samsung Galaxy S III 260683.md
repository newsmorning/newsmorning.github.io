Title: Samsung Galaxy S III Owners Beware: Charger Constantly Falls Off and Won't Charge - Here's What You Need to Know!

Are you an owner of a Samsung Galaxy S III? Do you have trouble keeping your charger securely fastened to your device? You’re not alone! This is a commonly reported issue among Samsung Galaxy S III owners. Not only is it frustrating, but it also means your phone may not be fully charged when you need it. In this article, we will cover the possible causes and remedies for this issue.

Possible Causes:

The issue of the charger falling off can originate from a few different factors, some of which are:

1. Incorrect Charger: Not all chargers are created equal. Make sure that the charger you’re using has been tested and is compatible with your device.

2. Software Malfunction: If your phone is unable to recognize when the charger is plugged in, there is a possibility that the issue could be caused by the software. Check for software updates or restart your device before considering other solutions.

3. Damage to the Port: If the charging port on your device has been damaged, it can cause the charger to slip out of place as it charges.

Remedies:

1. Replace Your Charger: First, try replacing the charger. A damaged or incompatible charger can cause the issue that you’re experiencing.

2. Cleaning the Charging Port: Over time, dust and debris can accumulate inside the charging port, making it harder for the charger to stay in place. You can try using a small brush or toothbrush to clean out the port carefully.

3. Adjusting the Charger: Try readjusting the charger whenever it falls off. Sometimes, a small adjustment can be enough to keep it securely in place.

4. Restart or Update: If the issue is caused by a software malfunction, a restart or software update may be able to fix the problem.

5. Professional Repair: If your charging port is damaged, it may be necessary to have it professionally repaired or replaced. Seek the help of a professional technician to ensure that the repair is done correctly.

In conclusion, dealing with a faulty charging port can be a significant inconvenience for Samsung Galaxy S III owners. However, by following the remedies discussed above, you can overcome this issue and ensure that your device stays fully charged whenever you need it.

## Chosen Solution
 When i plug my phone I. It's  loose I have
to wiggle it stay in Port how can I fix it

 First I would try a new charge cable, overtime the pins that hold the charge cable into the phone can stop functioning. If that's not the issue you will need to have the part replaced at a professional repair shop (because this Port is soldered to the mainboard). To give you an idea of price my shop does those for $60 we are however on the very low end of the spectrum of price.
