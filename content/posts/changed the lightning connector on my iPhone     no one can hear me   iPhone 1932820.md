X Is Now Useless! Changed The Lightning Connector On My iPhone And No One Can Hear Me! You Won't Believe What Happens Next!

As technology continues to evolve, new inventions come with new challenges. The latest dilemma that many iPhone users are experiencing is with the new Lightning connector. The Lightning connector is an Apple-designed cable used to charge, sync, and transfer data between the iPhone and other devices. The issue is that when users change their Lightning connector, their phones abruptly stop working. As a result, significant frustration and complaints have flooded the internet. 

Many have reported that their microphones no longer work when the charger is plugged in. This is a significant problem for a device reliant on phone calls or virtual meetings, which place users in a near-compromising position. What could possibly be the solution to this problem? Before we answer that question, let us delve deeper into what could be wrong with your iPhone.

Apple's technology is designed to protect users, and they are known for their quality-controlled technology. However, the Lightning connector also features a conductive and sensitive chip which controls certain functions. A failed installation of the cable or using an unapproved third-party cable can damage this chip causing it to fail permanently or temporarily. The microphone, speakers, and calling functions, all of which are at the mercy of the Lightning connector, will be affected. 

Knowing the problem is one thing. But what is the solution? It would seem that the most plausible course of action is to get a genuine Lightning cable from Apple. Although it may seem like a simple solution, it is undoubtedly an expensive one. As a result, many users opt to purchase a third-party cable. However, doing so can cause various issues, including short circuits or incompatibility with Apple's products, affecting the device's overall longevity.

In conclusion, changing Lightning connectors on iPhones can be risky. While the price may seem attractive to buy a non-Apple product, it may come at great costs ultimately. Although there are reports of some third-party Lightning cables that work just fine, it is safer to use genuine Apple products. Maintaining authenticity will reduce the risk of damage, prevent costs down the line, and help devices and software function optimally. It is essential to invest in authentic cables, accessories, and devices to get the best results from your iPhone.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello, i just changed the lightning connector on my Iphone, everything works great! except!!!! no once can hear me. Any suggestions on where I need to go and check? Thanks.

 Did you change just the lightning connector? Or the whole charge port cable assembly?
If the whole cable, more than likely there is an issue with the bottom microphone, which is part of this assembly on the vast majority of iPhones. At least as far back as the iPhone 5, but possible further back than that,
This could be a simple as the microphone is not properly aligned, or the connection between the cable assembly and the logic board is not good. See if a simple disconnect and reconnect of the cable helps.  But itâ€™s more likely in my experience that the replacement charge port assembly has a bad microphone. Or that when it was installed, there was some minute damage to the cable, preventing the mic signal from getting to the logic board at all.
Which iPhone is it specifically?

 When you changed the part did you remove the plastic films protecting the microphones? Also make sure the microphone is sitting in position where it should be. If it's slightly off it might be blocked by the adhesive.
