# 8573T's Screen Goes Dark, But Here's How You Can Bring It Back to Life!

If you're one of the many people who bought an 8573T laptop, you may have experienced some issues with the screen going dark unexpectedly. This can be a frustrating issue, but luckily there are several ways to bring your screen back to life. Here are a few tips to help you troubleshoot the problem and get your device up and running again.

## Check the Power Source

The first thing you should do if your screen goes dark on your 8573T is to check the power source. If your laptop is not properly charged, it may shut down or go into sleep mode to conserve battery life. Make sure your device is fully charged or plugged in before attempting any other troubleshooting steps.

## Adjust the Screen Brightness

Another potential issue could be the screen brightness settings. If your laptop is set to low brightness, it may appear as if the screen is completely off. To fix this, try increasing the brightness either by using the keyboard shortcut (Fn + F5) or manually adjusting the settings in the control panel.

## Toggle the Display Settings

If adjusting the brightness doesn't work, you can try toggling the display settings. Hold down the Windows key and press the P key to bring up the display options. Make sure the setting is set to "Duplicate" or "Extend Desktop" rather than "PC Screen Only."

## Restart the Laptop

If none of these methods works, restarting your laptop is often an easy solution to the problem. This can help clear any memory issues or software glitches that may be causing the screen to go dark.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, there are several ways to fix an 8573T screen that goes dark unexpectedly. Whether it's a power source issue, brightness settings, or display settings, these tips should help you troubleshoot and solve the problem. If all else fails, try contacting your laptop manufacturer for further assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 When I start my laptop it shows logo, lockscreen blinks and then displays black screen.

 If you are able to see a logo, then your monitor works. But if the screen goes blank afterwards, then Windows is not loading, and the problem is probably with your Windows installation.
The fix may be to reinstall Windows. To do this, download a Windows ISO file from the Microsoft website. Burn the file to a DVD, boot from the DVD, and follow the prompts.
