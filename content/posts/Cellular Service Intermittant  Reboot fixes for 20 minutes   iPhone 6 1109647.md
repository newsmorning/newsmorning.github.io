## Chosen Solution
 Hey crew.  I have an iphone here that gets service, but fluctuates from 4 bars, to one bar, to no service. Is there perhaps someone who has experienced this issue before, and if so, how to fix it.
I have replaced the board level antenna, the L antenna, The CP flex antenna, and the Top left Antenna bracket.
I have SMT experience, so if anything needs to be replaced on the board, just point me to it, and send me on my way.

 the problem is usually with bb_cpu it needs jumper wires ran under the chip.
