Title: Is Your iPhone 6 Home Button Failing You? Discover the Simple Fix Now!

Introduction:
If you are an iPhone 6 user, you must have been experiencing issues with the home button. It is not uncommon for the home button to stop working or fail to respond correctly. The home button is a crucial feature of the device, and its malfunction can cause significant inconvenience. Fortunately, there is a simple fix to address this issue. In this article, we will explore why the iPhone 6 home button fails and discover the simple fix to get your device working correctly.

Why does the iPhone 6 Home Button Fail?
Several reasons can cause the iPhone 6 home button to malfunction. The most common cause for this issue is a software glitch. Whenever you face any home button issue, the first thing you should do is a hard reset. In iPhone 6, you can perform a hard reset by pressing and holding the home button and the power button simultaneously for a few seconds. If this does not work, the next possible reason could be that the home button is dirty, and there is some debris accumulated inside the button. The home button is not designed to be repairable, so you may need to get your device to Apple service or a certified repair center if it is still not working properly even after hard-resetting. 

The Simple Fix:
Fortunately, there is a simple trick that has worked for many iPhone 6 users in resolving the home button failing issue. It is a temporary fix, but it can give you enough time to continue using your iPhone 6 until you can schedule a repair appointment with your dealer.

The trick involves using a feature on your iPhone 6 called "AssistiveTouch." AssistiveTouch is a feature designed to help individuals with disabilities by providing a virtual home button on the screen. You can access this feature by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch. From there, turn on the switch next to "AssistiveTouch."

Once you have enabled AssistiveTouch, a small circular button will appear on the screen. This button can be moved around and placed anywhere on the screen for convenience. When you click on this button, a menu will pop up, and you can access all the features that you usually access using the home button. To return to the home screen, simply click on the virtual home button.

While this trick does not fix the problem permanently, it can give you time to schedule a repair appointment or save up enough money to replace your device.

Conclusion:
The home button is an essential part of your iPhone 6, and its failure can cause significant inconvenience. Before jumping to the conclusion that you need to replace your device, try the simple fix of enabling AssistiveTouch. If the problem persists, make an appointment with your dealer so they can assist you in finding the right solution. It is always a good idea to keep your device updated, and regularly clean it to avoid dust accumulation. With these essential tips, you can keep your smartphone functioning optimally for a longer period.

## Chosen Solution
 Had a broken screen replacement done recently by a 3rd party about a month or so ago and now the home button works intermittently. I have to click it a bunch of times before it registers.
The home button itself clicks fine and is very responsive so I don't see a problem there. I took the phone apart and carefully removed the home button, ensured everything was clean. The cable looks fine, as does everything else. I reseated it, ensured it was in tight, ensured the screws were in tight and put everything back together. Still no change.
Close up of the button while disconnected:

Any ideas what to check next?
Update (05/21/2018)
I took the back off. I wonder if this could be the issue (small kink in cable)?

Update (05/22/2018)
Replaced the back plate with a brand new one, was careful to ensure the flex cables were fine.
Home button still doesn't work, at least works if I press real hard about 3-4 times then it registers.
Any other thoughts on what to do next?

 Check the home button flex that plugs into the motherboard that could be loose or something. If that doesn't change the issue I recommend getting the back LCD plate replaced. That could be the issue. Normally, I see this problem on iPhone 6s because the home button flex is within the display unit.  Let me know if this fixes the problem!

 I have the same problem. How have you fix it?
