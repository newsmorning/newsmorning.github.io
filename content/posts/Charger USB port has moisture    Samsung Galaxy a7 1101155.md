# Is Your Samsung Galaxy A7 Charger Port Moist? Here's the Surprising Reason Why You Need to Check It Out ASAP!

As a Samsung Galaxy A7 user, the charger port is one of the crucial components that keeps your smartphone running. Without it, your phone's battery would go dead, leaving you without communication or entertainment. However, what if your charger port becomes moist? Do you know what causes it and why you ought to check it out ASAP? Let us find out.

## The Surprising Reason Why the Samsung Galaxy A7 Charger Port Becomes Moist

The most common reason why your Samsung Galaxy A7 charger port might become moist is water damage. Spilling water or any other liquid on your phone or using it in wet environments, can cause moisture to accumulate on the port, resulting in it becoming damp. Besides water damage, moisture can also result from summer heat or high humidity levels.

## Why You Need to Check Your Charger Port ASAP?

Moisture on your Samsung Galaxy A7 charger port is a significant cause for concern, and you shouldn't take it lightly. When moisture accumulates on the port, it can corrode its components, cause the metal pins to rust, and lead to the buildup of moisture-induced debris. Such debris might block the current flow, causing difficulty in charging your phone, damaging the battery and slowing down overall performance. Furthermore, the moisture could potentially compromise your phone's safety and even cause a short circuit or electric shock.

## How to Check If Your Samsung Galaxy A7 Charger Port is Moist

Checking your charger port for moisture is a straightforward process. Here is what you need to do:

**Step One:** Turn off your Samsung Galaxy A7 smartphone and unplug the charger cable if it's connected.

**Step Two:** Inspect your charger port carefully by using a flashlight or bright lamp to check for moisture, dirt, lint, or debris.

**Step Three:** If you find moisture, use a microfiber cloth, or a soft-bristled brush to gently pat dry the area.

**Step Four:** In case the moisture persists, avoid using the charger until the port is completely dry. If you need to charge your phone urgently, use a wireless charger instead.

## How to Prevent Moisture from Accumulating on the Charger Port

Some tips to prevent your Samsung Galaxy A7 charger port from becoming moist are:

- Avoid using your phone in wet environments.
- Do not place your phone in areas where it is exposed to water, humidity or high temperatures.
- Clean your charger port regularly using a dry, soft-bristled brush or cloth to get rid of dirt, lint and debris.
- Invest in a protective phone case or cover that comes with a port protector, helping to prevent water or moisture from getting inside.

In conclusion, moisture on your Samsung Galaxy A7 charger port can cause significant damage to your phone's battery and even compromise the safety of the device's users. Always take necessary steps to inspect, clean and dry the charger port in case of moisture accumulation and adopt measures to prevent it from happening frequently.

## Chosen Solution
 I used my phone while i was at the beach. I was confident to use my phone because i was told that it was waterproof but then some notification  pop up sayong, "Moisture has been detected in your charger/USB port. Make sure that it is completely dry before charging your device. Drying the port may take some time." However it had been a day and half but still the notification hasn't disappear. What can i do with this?

 A few days ago, I had same problem with Samsung S8. When the phone was turned off, and I connected to the charger, a message appeared on the screen about moisture in the charging port.
I checked the charging port and I found some black dirt inside. I used tooth brush to clean but it did not reach the bottom of the charging port. Then I used a PCB cleaner ESD brush. It is stronger then a normal tooth brush, and it reached the bottom. After 5 minutes cleaning the problem solved. Sometimes I had to use a thin pointed tweezer to reach all the dirt on the bottom. The dirt was some black sticky material. That caused the moisture message.
