Keeps Restarting: Is Your LG4 Possessed By A Glitch Demon? Fix It Now!

Have you ever experienced the frustration of your LG4 phone constantly restarting, leaving you unable to use it properly? It can feel like your phone is possessed by a glitch demon, causing it to act out of its own accord. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem, and it's easier than you might think.

If your LG4 keeps restarting, the first thing you should do is check if it's a hardware or software issue. To do this, you can try a simple reboot by pressing and holding the power button until the device shuts down, and then turning it back on again. If this doesn't work, then it's likely a hardware issue, and you should seek professional help to fix it.

However, if the phone continues to restart, the problem could be related to an issue in the software. To fix this problem, you need to follow a series of steps that include updating your software, clearing caches and resetting your phone.

First, try to update your phone's software. The updates often fix bugs and glitches that could be causing your phone to restart. To update your software, go to your phone settings, click on 'about phone', and select software updates. You can also connect your phone to a computer and update the software using LG PC Suite.

If updating your software doesn't work, you can try clearing the cache. To do this, go to settings, then 'storage & USB', and select 'cached data'. Clear the cache, and restart your phone.

If clearing the cache doesn't solve the problem, you can try resetting your phone. Before resetting your phone, make sure to back up all your important data. To reset your phone, go to settings, then 'backup & reset', and select 'factory data reset'. Follow the on-screen instructions to reset your phone, and restart it.

If none of these steps worked, your phone could be suffering from a deeper problem. In this case, contacting your service provider or LG to get it fixed is the best option.

In conclusion, if your LG4 phone keeps restarting, it's essential to identify the root cause, which could be a hardware or software issue or a deeper problem. Follow the above steps to determine the cause of the problem and resolve it. If all else fails, seek professional assistance from a service provider or LG to fix it. Don't let a glitch demon take control of your phone, fix it now!


## Chosen Solution
 how can I prevent my LG4 phone from rebooting. That's all it does now. Can't use the phone at all. I tried starting in safe mode....nothing. I reset the phone to factory settings.....nothing.

 This usually means that the firmware has crashed. Try contacting LG for the firmware, put the phone in recovery mode using a combination of your buttons (you can find the combination on the internet) and try reinstalling the software. However all the data is lost.
