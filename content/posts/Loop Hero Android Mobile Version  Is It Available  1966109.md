But if you really want to play Loop Hero on your Android device, there’s a way you can experience it. LooPatHerO, which is an alpha of Loop Hero, is available on Android. It’s a demo and not a full game. Its apk size is 25MB. You can download the Loop Hero Android demo right here.
 
Based on the Changelog mentioned on the developer’s site, the last change was done in 2020 so there could be some things lacking in this demo compared to the final launched game.
