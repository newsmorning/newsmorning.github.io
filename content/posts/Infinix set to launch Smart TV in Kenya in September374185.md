New updates are being added at the bottom….
 
In the recent past, we have seen a number of smartphone makers dipping their toes into the whole Smart TV market. Nokia and OnePlus are notable examples in this scene.
 
If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. I mean, these phone makers definitely know a thing or two about smart devices and software maintenance and therefore, they’d be a better fit in this ‘smart’ age.
 
Locally, we’ve seen Transsion, the company behind Tecno, Infinix and iTel also push out a smart TV under its brand, Synix. The smart TV has been pretty well received, selling out a couple of times on Jumia.
 
Reports coming in indicate that Transsion is planning to further expand its smart TV portfolio with the launch of its Infinix X1 Smart TV into the Kenyan market.
 
Dubbed Infinix X1, the TV will be launched alongside the Infinix Zero 8 on September 7. 
 
According to the company, these are set to be available in two sizes, a 32-inch model and a 43-inch model. These appear to be a staple for Kenyans as many homes are more than comfortable with these sizes if sales of other brands are anything to go by.
 
These Infinix TVs come to square it out with aggressively-priced offers from its sister company Synix in form of the Synix A-series. These Android TV-powered units remain some of the cheapest offers we have in the market today.
 
It remains unclear why Transsion decided to have two TV brands in the market. Could Transsion be trying to be the Xiaomi of Kenya? It certainly appears so.
 
At the time of writing, we could not find any official listing of the Infinix X1 on any of Infinix’s official websites and as such, we couldn’t find the TVs’ specifications. We shall update this post with more details as and when it becomes available.
 
## Update 1 (September 10)
 
Infinix has just unveiled the Infinix X1 Smart TVs in Kenya. The 32-inch model starts at Ksh 19,500 while the 43-inch model starts at Ksh 32,000. All TVs are covered by a 24 months warranty.
