Title: Understanding The Shocking Truth About Apple's A1267 Acd 24 Backlight Issue In Their LED Cinema Display

Have you ever experienced sudden backlight issues in your Apple LED Cinema Display? Well, you're not alone! The A1267 Acd 24 Backlight Issue has been a rampant problem for many users worldwide.

It's a well-known fact that Apple never compromises on quality, and their products are among the best in the market. However, the A1267 Acd 24 Backlight Issue has led to dissatisfaction among some of the brand's ardent fans.

The A1267 Acd 24 Backlight Issue is a problem that affects the LED Cinema Display's backlighting system. The backlight is responsible for illuminating the display's screen, making it visible. A faulty backlight can lead to a darkened or dim display, making it difficult to use the device.

One primary reason for the Backlight Issue is the capacitor onboard the LED backlight inverter board. The capacitor is responsible for regulating power, and when it fails, it affects the unit's overall performance. The failure can result in flickering, flashing, or intermittent backlighting.

There are several other reasons why the backlight issue occurs. One of them is dust accumulation inside the device, resulting in thermals overheating. It causes the backlight to malfunction, forcing the user to replace it.

Another cause of the Backlight Issue is the LED backlight inverter board located at the bottom of the device. The inverter board regulates the power source from the supply, converting it to the right voltage level for the backlight. When the board fails, it affects the backlight's performance, leading to the Backlight issue.

The good news is that the A1267 Acd 24 Backlight Issue can be resolved by replacing the capacitor or the inverter board. However, do keep in mind that replacing these components can be costly and time-consuming. Apple offers an extended warranty on their Cinema Display devices, allowing users to benefit from free replacements and repairs within the warranty period.

If you already have an Apple LED Cinema Display with the A1267 Acd 24 Backlight issue, please do not panic. Call Apple Support for assistance, and they will walk you through the process of replacing the device or its components if required.

In conclusion, understanding the A1267 Acd 24 Backlight Issue is crucial for Apple LED Cinema Display users. Many have experienced it, and it can be resolved to eliminate any further complications. Follow the guidelines provided by Apple to prevent the issue from escalating and receive professional assistance when needed.


## Chosen Solution
 About two years ago I was playing a video game on my Mac Pro, although it was a low-end GPU, I was rendering the game on high graphical settings. The fans in the processor started revving up and making frighteningly loud noises. Then without warning the screen just shut off. From that moment I found that the display would not work unless I reduced the brightness below 10/15 increments. This got worse over time and now it only works on the lowest brightness setting. Shining a flashlight at the LED screen reveals a faint image when the display goes black. This suggests that the backlight is the issue. I carefully removed the glass, LCD screen and had a look at all the components inside. I'm no electrical engineer, but the Power Supply board and Logic board look fine to me (no swollen caps or burnt areas). I tested the voltage on the test points on the Logic board and it all reports fine.
From here, I don't know how to proceed troubleshooting this problem. It's always evading my attempt to fix it. The best way to troubleshoot this problem would be to temporarily swap identical model components to isolate what is the source of the problem. But I'm living in an area where nobody has a ACD. I've tried bartering with ACD sellers on online marketplaces to no luck. There are six main physical components inside the monitor that are culprits, replacing each on the off-chance would cost a collective ~â‚¬300 if I was unlucky.

Dan,
I've read the service manual carefully several times but I can find no solution and  I've read every answer to the backlight issue on fixit but find no solution.
I've taken apart and reassembled every component inside the monitor with the exception of the main driver cable leading directly into the monitor. It was covered with weird silver tape (electrical tape?) that had to be peeled back. But I haven't had the guts to attempt to remove the cable from the slot, as it doesn't seem to want to come out. Does anyone know how to remove this cable?

Update (04/25/2018)
I have an update 13 months since my last post. The brightness in my display eventually gave out entirely and just didn't boot up at all when I powered on the processor. But then to my surprise the processor also stopped booting! Which implies the problem was with the processor all along.
Anyway, I bought a replacement graphics card and PSU individually, and neither part solved the issue. I cleaned the inside thoroughly and made sure everything is connected and such.
I am not done with the problem. I have not yet found a solution. My current focus is on the backplane board as I have ruled out almost everything else.
Occasionally the processor boots after an attempt to power up, with the display flickering for a moment and then going black.

I had exactly the described problem 2 months back, I did some extensive research and tests with my oscilloscope.
I am not yet 100% where the problem lies but the monitor has worked perfectly for 3 weeks now.
I disassembled my display totally including the LG Panel and took some images. See the ifixit.com 27" What components need replacing on the Logic board?
I took apart the LED stripe as well and desoldered it. In addition to changing 8 capacitors in the power source and now the display works as a charm. I have also some pictures how to get the LED connector out, but that is really tedious, see the pics.
What components need replacing on the Logic board?

 I think you're digging in the wrong direction here.
If you review the troubleshooting section you'll see the issue is likely the backlight circuit on the main logic board. Did you test the connections to see if you see the required voltages as the guide explains?
I would start at the basics before digging into the LCD display unit.
FYI: The metal foil is for EMI emissions control. You'll need to get some fresh aluminum tape to replace it.

 Just posted a question / tips. if you could see some picture with a flashlight.
This could be the same problem I had. => change the power supply capacitors ( the 39uF / 400v)
It rebith mine.
