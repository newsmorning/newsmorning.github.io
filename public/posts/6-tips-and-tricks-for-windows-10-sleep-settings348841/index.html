If you’re a Windows 10 user, you probably know that the operating system has a ton of features and customization options. One of these options is the sleep settings for your device, which can greatly impact your user experience.\nToday, we’re going to share six sleep settings tips that will give you a better overall Windows 10 experience.\n1. Adjust Your Power Settings One of the most basic sleep settings you can change is your device’s power settings. By default, Windows 10 is set to a Balanced power plan, which balances energy consumption and performance.\nHowever, depending on how you use your device, you may want to change this setting to High performance or Power saver. The former is recommended if you use your device for gaming or heavy multimedia, while the latter will extend your battery life if you’re frequently on-the-go.\nTo adjust your power settings, simply search for “Power \u0026 sleep settings” in your Start menu and select “Additional power settings” to get started.\n2. Change Your Sleep Timer By default, Windows 10 is set to put your device to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. However, you can adjust this timer to better suit your needs.\nTo do so, open “Power \u0026 sleep settings” again and click on “Additional power settings.” Then, select “Change plan settings” next to the power plan you’re currently using.\nFrom there, you can adjust how long your device will wait before going to sleep. You can also choose to never have your device go to sleep if you prefer.\n3. Turn Off Hibernate Hibernate is a sleep mode that allows your device to save its current state and quickly resume where you left off. However, if you don’t use this feature or if you have limited storage, you may want to turn it off.\nTo do so, open your Command Prompt with administrator privileges and type the following command:\npowercfg -h off\nThis will disable hibernation on your device and reclaim some storage space.\n4. Keep Your Wi-Fi Connection Active If you’re downloading large files or streaming media, you may not want your Wi-Fi connection to turn off when your device goes to sleep. To disable this feature, open “Device Manager” from your Start menu and find your Wi-Fi adapter.\nRight-click on the adapter and select “Properties.” Then, go to the “Power Management” tab and uncheck the box that says “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.”\n5. Use Night Mode Night Mode, also known as Night Light, is a feature in Windows 10 that reduces the amount of blue light emitted by your device’s screen. This can help reduce eye strain and improve your sleep quality.\nTo enable Night Mode, open “Settings” from your Start menu and click on “System.” Then, select “Display” and turn on “Night light.”\n6. Customize Your Power Button Finally, you can customize what happens when you press the power button on your device. By default, pressing the power button will put your device to sleep, but you can change this to shut down or hibernate instead.\nTo customize your power button, open “Power \u0026 sleep settings” again and click on “Additional power settings.” Then, select “Choose what the power button does” from the left-hand menu.\nFrom there, you can choose whether to have your device sleep, shut down, or hibernate when you press the power button.\nIn conclusion, these six sleep settings tips can greatly improve your Windows 10 experience. By adjusting your power settings, changing your sleep timer, disabling hibernate, keeping your Wi-Fi connection active, using Night Mode, and customizing your power button, you can customize your device to better suit your needs. Give them a try and see how they transform your Windows 10 experience!\nWindows 10 offers various customizable sleep setting options, so your PC sleeps exactly the way you want. For example, you can set your PC to sleep after a predefined time period has elapsed. You can even make your PC fall asleep when you close your laptop’s lid.\nIn this guide, we’ll take a look at some of the Windows 10 sleep settings that you can tweak on your PC.\nChoose the Idle Duration After Which Your PC Sleeps When you configure sleep settings for your PC, the first option to define is how long your PC should be in idle mode to enter sleep mode. You can choose different options for both when your machine is plugged into a power source and when your machine is running on battery.\nOpen the Settings app on your PC by pressing Windows + I keys at the same time.Select System on the Settings screen.\nChoose Power \u0026 sleep from the sidebar on the left.Define when your PC goes to sleep in the Sleep section on the right.

This way, your PC never goes into sleep mode and always remains awake.\nPut Your Laptop to Sleep When You Close the Lid Windows 10 offers a sleep setting where you can put your laptop to sleep when you close the laptop’s lid. This is a handy and time-saving tip if you manually put your laptop to sleep mode while closing the lid.\nOpen the Settings app on your PC by pressing Windows + I.Head to System \u003e Power \u0026 sleep in the Settings app.Choose Additional power settings from the sidebar on the right.\nSelect Choose what closing the lid does from the left sidebar.\nSelect Sleep from both On battery and Plugged in drop-down menus for the When I close the lid option.\nSelect Save Changes at the bottom of the window to save your settings.\nPrevent Your Mouse From Waking Up Your PC From Sleep By default, Windows 10 allows your mouse or trackpad’s movement to bring your PC out of sleep mode. If you don’t want this to happen, turn off an option for your mouse in your PC’s Device Manager tool.\nOpen the Start menu, search for Device Manager, and select Device Manager in the search results.\nExpand the Mice and other pointing devices section in Device Manager.Right-click your mouse in the device list and select Properties from the menu.\nAccess the Power Management tab on the Properties window.Disable the Allow this device to wake the computer option. Then, select OK at the bottom.\nFrom now on, when your PC is in sleep mode and you move your cursor, your PC will remain in sleep and won’t come out of sleep mode.\nDisable Hybrid Sleep Setting to Prevent Issues Hybrid sleep in Windows 10 is the combination of sleep and hibernation modes. This combination sometimes creates various issues on your system. To prevent that from happening, it’s worth toggling off this option on your computer.\nOpen Control Panel on your PC. The easiest way to do this is to open the Start menu, search for Control Panel, and select that option in the search results.Choose Hardware and Sound on the Control Panel window.\nSelect Power Options on the screen that follows.\nFind your active power plan and select Change plan settings next to your plan.\nSelect Change advanced power settings.\nExpand the Sleep option on the Power Options window.Expand Allow hybrid sleep and choose Off for both On battery and Plugged in options.\nSelect Apply followed by OK at the bottom of the window.\nChange Your Power Plan to Apply Different Windows 10 Sleep Settings Each power plan on your Windows 10 PC carries different sleep settings.

Select the radio button beside the plan that you’d like to activate.\nYour PC now uses both power and sleep settings from your selected power plan. If a plan doesn’t meet your needs, you can quickly and easily switch to another plan whenever you want.\nCreate a Power Plan With Custom Sleep Settings If the Windows 10 sleep settings you need are not available in the default power plan, you can create your own custom power plan. You can copy the settings from an existing plan, tweak them to your requirements, and make a custom plan of yours.\nRight-click the Start menu and choose Power Options.\nSelect Additional power settings from the right sidebar.\nChoose Create a power plan from the options in the left sidebar.\nSelect an existing plan to copy settings from, type a name for your new power plan, and choose Next.\nSpecify the display off and sleep settings, and then select Create.\nYou’ll now see your newly created power plan on your screen. This plan is now in use and is the default power plan for your PC.To change your power plan’s advanced options, select Change plan settings \u003e Change advanced power settings.\nCustomize Your Windows 10 PC’s Sleep Patterns to Your Liking Windows 10 comes with appropriate sleep settings enabled, but these don’t always match a user’s requirements.
