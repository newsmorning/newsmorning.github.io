Attention Smart TV Owners: Don't Fall Victim to Hackers! Follow These 5 Essential Tips Now!

When people think about protecting their devices from hackers, they tend to prioritize their computers and smartphones. However, smart TVs are just as vulnerable to cyber attacks. In fact, hackers can use your smart TV to gain access to other connected devices in your network, steal sensitive data, or even spy on you. To keep your smart TV safe and secure, here are five essential tips you need to follow now.

1. Keep your smart TV's firmware and software up-to-date

Smart TVs, just like any other devices, receive software updates that can address security flaws and vulnerabilities. Make sure to enable automatic updates or check for updates manually regularly. By keeping your smart TV's firmware and software up-to-date, you can ensure that it has the latest security features and patches any known security holes.

2. Disable unnecessary features and permissions

Smart TVs come with features and permissions that are not essential, and may even pose security risks. For example, some smart TVs have microphones and cameras that can be used to eavesdrop on your conversations or record your activities. Some also come with pre-installed apps that are known to collect user data or contain malware. Disable any features or permissions that you don't need or use, and uninstall any apps that you don't trust or haven't used in a while.

3. Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication

Your smart TV may have a settings menu, parental controls, or online accounts that require passwords. Make sure to use strong, unique, and complex passwords that you don't use for any other accounts. Consider enabling two-factor authentication as an additional layer of security. This way, even if someone manages to steal or guess your password, they would still need an extra code from your phone to access your account.

4. Secure your home network and router

Your smart TV is only as secure as your home network and router. Make sure to secure your network by using a strong password, disabling remote access, and enabling encryption. Keep your router's firmware up-to-date, and change its default login credentials to prevent unauthorized access. Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic and protect your privacy.

5. Be cautious of what you watch, download, or click

Finally, be cautious of what you watch, download, or click on using your smart TV. Avoid visiting suspicious websites, downloading unknown files or apps, or clicking on pop-up ads or links that seem too good to be true. Hackers can use social engineering and phishing tactics to trick you into giving them access to your smart TV or network.

In summary, don't fall victim to hackers by neglecting your smart TV's security. Follow these five essential tips to stay safe and secure, and enjoy your favorite shows and movies without worrying about cyber attacks. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and stay protected!

As almost all of our IoT devices need an active WiFi connection for functioning, we highly recommend you to keep a separate network for smart TV. In this way, even if by any chance hackers try to infect your smart TV device, they won’t be able to target other smart home gadgets and appliances through penetrating the same WiFi network. So, choosing a separate or a secondary WiFi network for connecting your Smart TV will make it more secure.
 
### Disable the Mic
 
The modern-day smart TVs come equipped with an in-built mic to support voice assistant functionality. But to make your Smart TV more secure, turn off the mic or any other input-activated device that is connected to your device when not in use. Try and avoid keeping the mic turned on for 24×7, as it may invite some uncalled trouble or security threats.
