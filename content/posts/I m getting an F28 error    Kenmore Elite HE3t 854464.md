# Is Your Kenmore Elite He3T Ruined Forever? Discover the Shocking F28 Error Code Now!

As a proud owner of a Kenmore Elite He3T washing machine, nothing can be more frustrating than encountering an error code that you don't understand. One of the most dreaded error codes is the F28 error code, which can make your washing machine appear to be ruined beyond repair. However, before you give up on your Kenmore Elite He3T, it is essential to understand what the F28 error code means and how you can fix it.

The F28 error code is a communication error, and it can happen due to various reasons, including a broken connection or a problem with the motor control unit. Generally, this issue occurs when the communication between the central control unit and the motor control unit is interrupted.

So, how do you know if your Kenmore Elite He3T is affected by the F28 error code?

When your Kenmore Elite He3T faces this error code, it displays a message that reads "F28" on its LCD screen. Also, your washing machine may stop functioning, and you may notice that it has locked up the door, making it impossible for you to access its interior.

Now that you know if your washing machine is facing this problem, let's look at how you can resolve it.

The first step to resolve the F28 error code is to perform a power reset. To reset your Kenmore Elite He3T, unplug the machine from the power source for at least thirty minutes. After thirty minutes, plug it back in and start the washing cycle again.

If the error code persists, the next step is to check the connections. Ensure that all the connections are tight and secure. If the connections are loose, you can tighten them to resolve the F28 error code.

However, if the problem persists, the root cause may be the motor control unit or the central control unit. In such a scenario, it is essential to contact a professional technician to fix the problem.

In conclusion, the F28 error code is not the end of the world for your Kenmore Elite He3T washing machine. By performing a power reset and checking the connections, you can quickly resolve the issue. However, if the problem persists, it is best to contact a professional technician to help diagnose and provide the best solution to remedy the error. Remember, take care of your washing machine and it will serve you well for years to come.


## Chosen Solution
 Is the Kenmore Elite HE3 the same as the Kenmore Elite HE3t? I'm attempting to reset the CCU and MCU wires, but I'm not sure I'm seeing where I should be working.

 lyle3 check the answer i'm getting a f28 error code and see if that will work for you.

 Hey oldturkey03 - thanks for your reply! I actually did start with that post's information, and when I removed the top of our washer, the pieces he described were not in the same location. That's why I thought there might be some different info out there for the HE3t. I checked all connections and replaced the top, but our washer is still doing the same thing: the water will begin to fill the drum, but after three seconds snaps off and the door makes the locking sound again. After that, nothing. The problem is bound to be related to our shifting the washer about three feet the other day, and I'm guessing the door thinks it's unlocked or isn't getting all the right info, etc.
