What is a Logic Board?

The logic board, or motherboard, is the central component in your MacBook Pro that controls all the functions of your computer. It is responsible for connecting all the other components of your Macbook Pro together and ensuring they communicate with each other. The logic board contains the CPU (central processing unit), memory (RAM), graphics card, and the I/O (input/output) ports.

Why is the Model Number Important?

First of all, knowing the model number of your MacBook Pro logic board can help you troubleshoot problems. By knowing the model number of your logic board, you can identify the correct parts and repair instructions. This means you can fix your computer instead of having to replace it.

Secondly, it can help you avoid buying the wrong components. Apple MacBook Pro has different generations and models, and each has a different logic board. Many times, people unknowingly order a part for a different MacBook model. This can lead to significant problems and wasted money.

How to Find the Model Number?

To find the model number of your MacBook Pro logic board, you will need to use a tool called "System Information." This tool is built-in to macOS and provides important information about your Macbook Pro hardware.

To access the "System Information" tool, go to "About This Mac" under the Apple Menu. In the window that opens, you will see an option for "System Report." Click it, and a new window will open.

In the new window, scroll down to "Hardware" and click the arrow next to it to expand the list. You will see an option for "Legacy Hardware," which includes your Macbook Pro logic board model. Click it, and you will see the model number of your logic board.

Final Thoughts
