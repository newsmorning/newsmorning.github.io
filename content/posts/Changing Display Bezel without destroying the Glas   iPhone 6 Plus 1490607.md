# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Swap Your iPhone 6 Plus Display Bezel Without Breaking the Glass!

Are you tired of dealing with a cracked or scratched iPhone 6 Plus display? Fear not, for you can easily swap out the display bezel without breaking the glass. Yes, you read that right. It may seem daunting or even impossible, but with the right tools and a bit of patience, you can give your iPhone a brand new look.

Before we begin, there are a couple of things worth mentioning. First and foremost, we strongly advise that you take caution when handling the delicate components of your iPhone. It's recommended that you have some experience in handling small tools and working with electronics. Secondly, you will need to purchase a replacement display bezel. These can usually be found online or in a local smartphone repair shop.

With that being said, let's get started.

**Step 1: Gather your tools**

In order to swap your iPhone 6 Plus display bezel, you will need the following tools:

- Phillips head screwdriver
- Pentalobe screwdriver
- Spudger tool
- Suction cup
- Flathead screwdriver
- Replacement display bezel

**Step 2: Power Off and Remove the Screws**

Power off your iPhone 6 Plus and remove the two screws located at the bottom of the device. These are small pentalobe screws, and they secure the display assembly to the iPhone.

**Step 3: Remove the Display Assembly**

Place the suction cup over the lower half of the iPhone display, ensuring that it is securely attached. Gently pry the display assembly up with your spudger tool or flathead screwdriver, starting at the bottom of the device. Once you have separated the display assembly from the iPhone, gently lift it up and to the left to gain access to the internal components.

**Step 4: Remove the Bezel**

Using your Phillips head screwdriver, remove the three screws securing the display bezel to the iPhone. Once these screws are removed, use your spudger tool or flathead screwdriver to gently remove the bezel from the display assembly.

**Step 5: Replace the Bezel**

Take your replacement display bezel and carefully line it up with the display assembly. Gently press down on the bezel until it snaps into place.

**Step 6: Reassemble**

With the new bezel in place, it's time to reassemble your iPhone 6 Plus. Simply follow the steps in reverse order, making sure to securely attach the display assembly to the iPhone with the two pentalobe screws at the bottom of the device.

Congratulations! You have successfully swapped your iPhone 6 Plus display bezel without breaking the glass. Your iPhone now has a fresh new look, and you can enjoy using it without the distraction of unsightly scratches or cracks.

In conclusion, replacing your iPhone 6 Plus display bezel can seem intimidating, but with the right tools and a bit of patience, it's a relatively simple process. Just remember to take caution when handling small components and be sure to power off your iPhone before beginning any repairs.

## Chosen Solution
 I got an iPhone 6 PLus with broken DIsplay Bezel.
The Glas and the LCD are not broken or something else.
Is it possible to remove and change the bezel against a new one without damaging the Glas?

 It really depends on how you plan to do it.
The way I do it is I heat up the display, then carefully removed the frame.  This will scratch up the glass and you will also destroy your small pieces like camera and sensor brackets.  I have a framing machine to replace the frame, which is the only dependable way of doing it.  You can try to hot glue it, but it will be very weak and probably lift.
So the answer is: Yes you can.  No you shouldn't.
