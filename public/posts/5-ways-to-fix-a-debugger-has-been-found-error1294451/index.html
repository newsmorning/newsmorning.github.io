It is frustrating and time-consuming to scratch your head trying to find the root cause of the error. It may seem difficult to fix, but don’t worry, we have come up with five surprising hacks to fix your debugger errors in no time. These hacks will help you understand the error and debug your code like a pro. Let’s dive in!\nStep-by-Step Debugging: One of the most common problems in debugging is not knowing where the error occurred. This is particularly frustrating when dealing with long code blocks. In such cases, it is best to use step-by-step debugging. Step-by-step debugging allows the programmer to move through the code, line by line, until the error is discovered. This approach helps you to understand the flow of the program and locate where the error occurred.\nUse Conditional Breakpoints: Conditional breakpoints are a great way to break your code’s execution flow only when certain conditions are met. In other words, it is a way to pause the code execution when a particular condition is true. This helps you in identifying an issue in just the right place. Using this option can save you a lot of time by breaking the code at critical locations.\nPrint Debugging: Suppose your code is running fine, but you suspect that some variables are not getting their expected values. In this case, print debugging comes in handy. A quick way to debug such situations is to add a print statement to the suspected area. Every time you run the program the print statement will provide the variable’s value at that point. It may sound low tech, but it’s often faster and more effective than using more advanced methods.\nUse a Debugger GUI: Using a GUI debugger allows the programmer to visualize and debug the code easily. The GUI debuggers usually provide functionality such as breakpoints, setting Watchpoints, and expression evaluation. Such a debugging tool can provide visualization of complex data structures that can be difficult to understand using just print statements.\nStart with a Fresh Mind: Debugging can be frustrating, and it’s easy to lose patience, which often leads to more errors. Therefore, it is essential to start with a fresh mind. Take short breaks in between, walk a little, or listen to music to get refreshed before diving back in the code. A clear mind can help you identify the real cause of the problem and fix it more effectively.\nConclusion:\nDebugging can be challenging, but these 5 surprising hacks will help you debug your code like a pro. So, the next time you encounter an error or a bug, try using these methods to fix them with ease. Remember, debugging is an important part of software development, and it is essential to master the art of debugging to become a successful programmer. Happy Coding!\nDid you just encounter the “A debugger has been found” error on Windows 11? Well, yes, it’s extremely annoying and can interrupt your workflow. This error usually triggers when you’re trying to open certain apps or games on your device. If this error pops up, you won’t be able to even launch the program which is quite disappointing.\nWondering how to fix this issue? We’ve got you covered. In this post, we have listed a variety of solutions that you can use to get rid of this error message.\nLet’s get started.\n6 Ways To Fix “A Debugger Has Been Found” Error on Windows 11 Solution 1: Configure the System Configuration Settings If the Debug mode is enabled by default then you may constantly see the “A debugger has been found” error while using your device. To uncheck the Debug mode, you will have to make a little change in the System Configuration window. Follow these quick steps to do the same:\nStep 1: Press the Windows + R key combination to open the Run dialog box.\nStep 2: Type “Msconfig” in the textbox and hit Enter.\nStep 3: In the System Configuration window, switch to the “Boot” tab. Tap on “Advanced Options”.\nStep 4: You will now see the Boot Advanced Options window on the screen. Uncheck the “Debug” option in case it was enabled by default.\nStep 5: Exit all windows, reboot your device and check if the issue was resolved.\nAlso read: How To Fix ‘There Has Been an Error’ in Microsoft Store\nSolution 2: Add the App to the Exclusion List If the “A debugger has been found” error keeps popping up when you try to open a certain app or game then you can try this method. You can add the affected program to the antivirus software’s exclusions list. Here’s how you can add an item to the exclusions list on the Windows Security app.\nStep 1: Tap on the search icon placed on the Taskbar, type “Windows Security” and hit Enter to launch the app.\nStep 2: Switch to the “Virus and threat protection” tab from the left menu pane.\nStep 3: Tap on the “Manage Settings” option.\nStep 4: In the next window, scroll down to the “Exclusions” section. Tap on the “Add or remove exclusions” option.\nStep 5: Hit the “Add an Exclusion” button. You will now see a list of all the installed programs on the screen. Select the app that you wish to add to the exclusions list.\nStep 6: Relaunch the application and check if you are still encountering the error.\nSolution 3: Uninstall GameGuard Several users reported that uninstalling the GameGuard app helped in getting rid of the debugger error message. So, go ahead and try your luck. Here’s what you need to do:\nStep 1: Press the Windows + R key combination to open the Run dialog box. Type “appwiz.cpl” in the textbox and hit Enter.\nStep 2: Scroll through the list of programs to look for “GameGuard”. Right-click on it and select “Uninstall”.\nSolution 4: Use the System Restore Feature If you are unable to get rid of the debugger error on Windows then you can use the System Restore feature to roll back your computer to a previous checkpoint. By doing so, you easily undo all the recent changes that may have been causing the error. Here’s what you need to do:\nStep 1: Tap on the search icon placed on the Taskbar, type “Create a Restore Point” and hit Enter.\nStep 2: The System Properties window will now appear on the screen. Tap on the “System Restore” button.\nStep 3: Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed. Select the most recently created checkpoint to roll back your device.\nStep 4: After restoring your device to a previous date and time, you will hopefully resolve the debugger error.\nAlso read: How To Fix The “Not Enough Physical Memory Is Available” VMware Error In Windows\nSolution 5: Update Windows Using an outdated version of Windows can also trigger the “A debugger has been found” error on your device.
