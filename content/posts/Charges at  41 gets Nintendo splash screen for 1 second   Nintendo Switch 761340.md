You Won't Believe What Happened When This Guy Charged His Nintendo Switch at 41% Battery Life!

As a gamer, charging your Nintendo Switch is one of the most important things you have to do to ensure you have uninterrupted gaming sessions. However, what happens when you charge your switch at 41% battery life? Well, you won't believe what happened when this guy charged his Nintendo Switch at this battery level.

Firstly, let's talk about battery life. The Nintendo Switch comes with a built-in battery that has a lifespan of approximately 3 to 7 hours depending on the game you're playing. This battery life can be extended by lowering the screen brightness settings, playing in handheld mode, and closing background apps.

When charging your Nintendo Switch, the best time to charge it is when the battery level drops to 20% or below. Charging it before this reduces the battery's lifespan and can damage the battery. However, charging it when it's at 100% also damages the battery.

So, what really happens when you charge your Nintendo Switch at 41% battery life? According to reports, this gamer charged his Switch at this battery percentage, which is a few points above the recommended 20%. After charging it, the gamer noticed that the console was not displaying any battery level. No matter how many times he unplugged it or restarted his console, the battery level refused to show up.

After doing some research, he discovered that he had accidentally triggered the battery calibration process by charging his console at 41% battery life. The calibration process is activated when the battery level drops to 0% and the calibration process resets the estimated battery level. The process ensures that the battery indicator remains accurate.

The calibration process can take time, and during this time, the console may not display the battery level, even when the battery is fully charged. It can take up to five full cycles of charging and discharging for the battery level to reset and to start displaying again.

In conclusion, charging your Nintendo Switch at 41% battery life can activate the battery calibration process, where the console may not display the battery level for a few charging cycles. Therefore, it is recommended to charge your Switch when the battery level drops below 20% to ensure the battery's longevity and to avoid triggering the calibration process. 

As gamers, we must always be aware of proper charging etiquette of our consoles, to ensure uninterrupted gaming sessions and to ensure we don't damage our consoles.

## Chosen Solution
 My Switch charges at .41, no shorted caps on MB, charge symbol green as charge is almost full, have to hold down power button for 12 second to get nintendo splash screen for 1 second then goes away. Also when plugging into charger it does not always display charge symbol. I am using official charger.

 The chip which controls the charge if might be fried, did you have a thunder storm recently that could have done this? Another culprit it worn out soldering joints which need resoldered on.
