# Say Goodbye to Expensive TV Repairs with This Simple DIY Guide to Fixing Your 32" Hisense LED TV Screen Replacement!

If you're a TV lover, then you understand the pain of having a broken or damaged TV screen. It's even more frustrating when you have to pay expensive repair fees, or worse, replace the entire TV set. However, with this DIY guide to fixing your 32" Hisense LED TV screen replacement, you'll be able to save yourself the hassle and costs of a professional repair.

Here's what you'll need:

1. A new 32" Hisense LED TV screen

2. Screwdriver 

3. Electric Tape

4. Pliers

5. A clean and flat surface to work on 

Once you have all the necessary tools and equipment, follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Remove the back panel

The first step is to remove the back panel of your Hisense TV. To do this, use a screwdriver to unscrew the screws holding the panel in place. Place the screws in a safe place where you can find them later.

Step 2: Detach the broken screen

Once the back panel is off, you'll see the screen attached to the TV set. Carefully unplug the connectors on the circuit board that connect the screen to the TV. Use a pair of pliers to gently remove any clips holding the screen in place.

Step 3: Install the new screen

Take the new screen and make sure it fits your Hisense TV set perfectly. Carefully plug the connectors back into the circuit board and attach any clips that hold the screen in place. 

Step 4: Test the TV with the new screen

Once the new screen is installed, replace the back panel and securely screw it in place. Connect the TV to a power outlet and turn it on. If everything works perfectly, then congratulations! You've fixed your TV screen!

If you run into any issues during the process, take notes of what steps were taken, and consult a professional repairer, or contact Hisense customer service, to assist in solving the issue.

Conclusion

In conclusion, repairing a broken 32" Hisense LED TV screen isn't as complicated as it sounds. With this simple DIY guide, you'll be able to fix your broken TV without spending a fortune on professional repairs. Just remember to take your time, work carefully, and have all the necessary tools in place. Good luck, and enjoy your newly fixed TV!
