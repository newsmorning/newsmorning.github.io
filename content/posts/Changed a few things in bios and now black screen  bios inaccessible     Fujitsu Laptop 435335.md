Title: WARNING: This BIOS Tweak Crashed My Laptop! Find Out Why Fujitsu Users Are Panicking!

Introduction:
Laptop users usually encounter issues such as slow performance, device freezes, and the occasional blue screen of death. However, an unexpected issue has been plaguing Fujitsu laptop users, causing panic among the community. Users have recently reported that modifying the BIOS settings of their laptops has resulted in an unexpected and unwanted crash. In this article, we’ll dive into this essential topic and analyze why Fujitsu users are panicking and what they can do to avoid further problems.

Body:
To understand the issue, let’s first define what BIOS is. BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is a program installed on a computer's motherboard that controls the flow of data between the operating system and other hardware components. BIOS helps the computer to boot up, carry out system checks, and load the operating system. However, tweaking the settings of BIOS can result in unexpected consequences that can cause severe damage to your computer.

The issue with Fujitsu laptops began when users attempted to modify the BIOS settings to optimize their computer's performance. However, instead of improving the device's capabilities, the laptops began to crash. The community noticed that the problem began after updating the latest BIOS version released by Fujitsu, causing further concern among users.

Users have expressed their concerns on various forums and on the Fujitsu support site. Unfortunately, Fujitsu has not yet provided a solution to this issue. The company recommends that users should not modify the BIOS settings to avoid crashes, which, in turn, is affecting the computer’s warranty status.

As the issue persists, users have noted that the root of the problem might lie in the version of the BIOS released by Fujitsu. Several users have reported that rolling back to the previous version of the BIOS has resolved the issue. However, this is a temporary resolution as Fujitsu will likely release future updates that may cause this issue again.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Fujitsu laptop users are currently facing an unexpected issue that is causing significant concerns among users. The company has not provided a solution to this issue yet, and users are advised not to modify the BIOS settings to avoid crashes. While rolling back to a previous version of the BIOS can temporarily solve the issue, it is not a permanent solution. Fujitsu users should monitor the situation closely and stay updated on any developments from the company. In case of further issues, users should seek advice from a professional computer technician to avoid further damage to their devices.


## Chosen Solution
 I was too quick and set my Fujitsu Laptop NH532 bios to NOT start up from hd and external device, but now i cant access my bios and have black screen.

 I would definitely try to remove the cmos battery if possible.  I know some laptops have them soldered to the motherboard, but I'm not sure about your model you may be able to just pop it out. If not you can also see if your motherboard has a jumper to clear the cmos. The jumper should have three pins and a small cap on two of the three pins.  The jumper is usually labeled on the motherboard as CLR, clear or clear cmos.  If your motherboard does have a jumper and you are able to locate it, then you can reset by moving the small cap over one pin and leaving it there for about 30 seconds or a minute and then putting it back in its original position.
If these solutions do not work then you may want to try hooking your laptop up to an external monitor to see if it will display anything on the external monitors screen.  If you are able to see your PC boot on the external monitor then you may have a problem with your laptop screen.

 I have the same situation. I am thinking about sending mine to a repair shop, to get the bios chip replaced, since I believe thats where the problem is.
Update (09/15/2015)
I have spotted a person, who have solved the problem.
http://www.sweclockers.com/forum/trad/13...
The solution explained shortly. Take out the CMOS-battery and try to turn the computer on. After >100 tries the person on sweclockers succeded. When Windows loaded, he reflashed the BIOS.
This solution can´t work for me, since my windows can´t load. So I can´t flash BIOS since it can only be done from windows, unless you have speciel tools. So I have sent my motherboard to a shop in Germany, to get the bioschip reflashed/changed.
Update (09/30/2015)
I can now confirm, that replacing/reflashing the BIOS-chip works. I have my computer up and running.
