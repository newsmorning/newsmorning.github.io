When it comes to battery life, both smartwatches have been known to provide reasonably good performance. However, advancements in technology have brought about an exciting development to watch lovers out there. It is said that newer versions of these smartwatches are expected to offer significant battery life upgrades that will leave you awestruck.\nLet’s take a look at what we can expect from Samsung and Apple.\nGalaxy Watch\nSamsung is expected to release its Galaxy Watch 4 model in 2021, and it is rumored to have a significantly improved battery life that will blow you away. Galaxy Watch models currently last between two to four days, depending on usage, but the new version is expected to last up to a week-long, which is a massive improvement.\nThe Galaxy Watch 4 is likely to use an Exynos W920 chipset, which is said to use a 5nm process, making it much more efficient than its predecessor. The internal battery is also expected to be bigger, leading to a longer battery life.\nOther features to expect in the Galaxy Watch 4 include always-on display, multiple watch faces, and an ECG monitor, among others.\nApple Watch Series 7\nApple is also making strides in the battery life department. The Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to offer a more extended battery life and better performance than its predecessor, the Watch Series 6.\nThe new Apple Watch is rumored to have a redesign, which could make more space for a bigger battery. Analysts predict that Apple may use a new LTPO OLED display, which will guarantee a longer battery life with its improved efficiency. The new smartwatch could also include a new chip that is more efficient than the current one, leading to significant improvements in battery life.\nOther features that may be included in the Apple Watch Series 7 include blood glucose monitoring, improved workout tracking, and new watch faces.\nConclusion\nThe upcoming smartwatches from Samsung and Apple are expected to provide significant advancements in battery life, which is great news for smartwatch enthusiasts out there. Longer battery life means fewer pauses in your daily routine to charge your watch, and also improves your overall experience with the device.\nIt will be interesting to see how these new models compete and what other amazing new features they may offer, but one thing is for sure: the upcoming upgrades in battery life are jaw-dropping and will improve the smartwatch experience for everyone.\nThe Galaxy Watch 5 is rumored to offer three-day battery life, making it stand out among a legion of premium smartwatches that barely last 24 hours.\nThe latest batch of leaks claim the Galaxy Watch 5 will boast an impressive three-day battery life.Experts believe the leaks are plausible, making the upcoming smartwatch a huge leap forward over the existing Galaxy Watch 4.The Galaxy Watch 5’s longevity could help Samsung compete with the ever-popular Apple Watch. A new batch of rumors regarding the Galaxy Watch 5 indicate Samsung’s upcoming wearable will offer an impressive three-day battery life. Considering the Galaxy Watch 4 could scarcely last two days, that’s a marked improvement for Samsung’s flagship wearable. Samsung is expected to reveal more about the Galaxy Watch 5 during its Galaxy Unpacked event on August 10, but it sounds like the latest rumors could be spot-on regarding the smartwatch’s battery.\n“Given the Galaxy Watch 4 could go for two days, a three-day battery sounds very reasonable,” Michael Gartenberg, tech analyst and Apple’s former marketing director, told Lifewire via Twitter. Gartenberg went on to call this a “meaningful” upgrade, as “people could go away for a weekend and not need to bring a charger.”\nThree Days Is a Long Time for a (Mainstream) Smartwatch The Galaxy Watch 5’s supposed three-day battery life isn’t breaking any records. Plenty of smartwatches can go days without a recharge, such as the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar, which can run for a staggering 16 days. But that premium device carries a hefty $750 price tag and isn’t nearly as mainstream as the Galaxy Watch.\nHowever, if Samsung does pack a three-day battery into the Watch 5, it could be among a handful of flagship products to boast that level of longevity. As Ben Dickson, software engineer and founder of TechTalks, told Lifewire via Twitter, the appeal of battery life “depends on the watch” and doesn’t immediately mean the wearable will find success.\n“Apple Watch has very good features, but poor battery life. Garmin has decent battery life, but it is not as solid as Apple,” Dickson said. “So three-day battery life would be acceptable on something at the caliber of Apple and Samsung.”\nThe Galaxy Watch 5 might not boast the longest battery life on the market, but it’s positioned to offer one of the best for a mainstream wearable with a reasonable price tag—and far surpass what the Apple Watch offers. Limited runtime has long been an issue for smartwatch buyers, and reducing the frequency of recharges could be a big selling point.\nRumors Point to a Cheaper Base Price Speaking of pricing, new rumors put the Galaxy Watch 5 at a starting MSRP below that of the existing Galaxy Watch 4. The Galaxy Watch 5 will reportedly cost $10 less than the outgoing model, while the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (the Watch 4 Classic’s replacement) will be $30 more expensive. Unlike the battery rumors, however, Gartenberg isn’t certain about the validity of these numbers.\n“Given the economy, I’d say that will be something decided right up until the end,” he said.\nThe economy has been nothing if not tumultuous of late, and it’s possible Samsung will change course on pricing in the days leading up to the Galaxy Watch 5’s reveal. These early figures are encouraging, and hopefully, we’ll learn more about pricing during next month’s Galaxy Unpacked.\nStacking Up to the Competition The Apple Watch has long been the champion of smartwatches, thanks to a premium design and suite of exclusive features not found on other wearables. According to a June 2022 report from Statista, “Apple has been the industry leader in the wearables segment [since 2017], with almost nine billion euros in revenue coming from the wearable segment in early 2022.”\nThat same report mentions Samsung as Apple’s closest competitor, as “one of the largest owners of wearables patents.” In fact, Samsung holds more than three times as many wearables patents as Apple—meaning the company could have big plans for its Galaxy Watch lineup.\nWe won’t know exactly what the future holds for the latest wearable until it’s revealed, but Gartenberg believes the play for battery life will “give buyers one more reason to think of Samsung as their next purchase.”\nGet the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\n","wordCount":"1153","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Barbara Bagen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/look-out-apple-galaxy-watch-could-get-much-better-battery-life1266667/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Galaxy Watch vs. Apple: Brace Yourself for Jaw-Dropping Battery Life Upgrade!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 18, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1153 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Barbara Bagen</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#three-days-is-a-long-time-for-a-mainstream-smartwatch>Three Days Is a Long Time for a (Mainstream) Smartwatch</a></li><li><a href=#rumors-point-to-a-cheaper-base-price>Rumors Point to a Cheaper Base Price</a></li><li><a href=#stacking-up-to-the-competition>Stacking Up to the Competition</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Galaxy Watch vs. Apple: Brace Yourself for Jaw-Dropping Battery Life Upgrade!</p><p>In the world of smartwatches, Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Watch and Apple&rsquo;s Watch Series 6 are two of the most popular brands.
