Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to My Google Pixel 4 After a Camera Repair - My Face Unlock is Now Useless!

Introduction:
In the world of technology, one can never be too careful. Your devices are vulnerable to a plethora of problems, ranging from hardware issues to software glitches. Recently, I experienced an alarming situation: my Google Pixel 4's Face Unlock stopped working after a camera repair. The problem was so severe that I could not access my phone until I found a solution. In this article, I will narrate my experience and tell you what I did to fix the issue.

My Experience:
I love my Google Pixel 4, and I have been using it for over six months. I am all about technology, and I love its premium features. However, the device has a weak spot: the camera. The camera glass shattered, and I had to take it to a local repair shop.

The repair was prompt, and I was happy with the result. However, when I tried to access my phone, I was in for a rude shock. The Face Unlock feature, which is one of the Pixel's most distinctive features, wouldn't work. I tried several times, but nothing happened. I was flabbergasted and frustrated.

I contacted the repair shop, hoping for a solution. They offered to re-do the repair, but the issue wasn't with the camera. Instead, it was the Face Unlock feature, which had stopped working. The repair shop couldn't help me with that, and I had to find a solution on my own.

How I Fixed the Problem:
I did some research and found out that the Face Unlock feature depends on two main components: a camera sensor and a depth sensor. When I got my camera repaired, the depth sensor was probably damaged, which caused the issue.

To fix the problem, I had to reset the Face Unlock feature entirely. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Go to "Settings" and tap on "System."
Step 2: Tap on "Security and Location."
Step 3: Tap on "Face Unlock."
Step 4: Enter your PIN, pattern, or password.
Step 5: Tap on "Set Up Face Unlock."
Step 6: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the feature again.

After resetting the Face Unlock feature, it started working again. I was back to using my Google Pixel 4 as usual.

Conclusion:
Technology can be a tricky thing, and sometimes, things can go wrong. Be it a hardware issue or a software glitch. The important thing is to keep calm and find a solution. If your Face Unlock stops working after a camera repair, don't panic. Try resetting the feature before going for another repair. It might save you some unnecessary expenses.

## Chosen Solution
 After repairing the camera, when trying to re-setup face unlock this message pops up and cancels the setup “Enrollment was not completed, certificate expired“

 The problem is that the camera module is tied to each board.
I can confirm this. Pucchaced an At&t pixel 4 on ebay that wasn't working. And another unlocked version with a broken screen. Now the damage to the screen was at the top close to the modules. So when doing the board swap I decided not to swap camera modules because the fear of having a damaged module. After swap face unlock work before reboot. After that it never worked on both phones. Had to swap over the camera modules to get face unlock. Works like a charm now..
Hope this

 This might be stupid if you have not tried but if you have not go to settings and go to where it said password if you click on that and it will ask you for a passcode put that in and there is a button which said reset face id click on that and you can reset it.
