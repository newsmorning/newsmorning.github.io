# You Won't Believe How Easy it Is to Master Depreciation Journal Entry with These Step-by-Step Examples!

Keeping financial records is a vital aspect of running any business or organization. One of the essential elements of financial accounting is the depreciation of assets. Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a long-term asset over its useful life. Keeping track of depreciation is significant for tax purposes and proper financial reporting. 

The depreciation journal entry can be intimidating for many small business owners or inexperienced accountants. However, with a step-by-step guide, it can be easy to master. In this article, we'll go over the process of creating a depreciation journal entry, and we'll use examples to make it easy to understand.

## What is Depreciation?

Before we dive into the journal entry, let's define depreciation briefly. Depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a long-term asset over its useful life. In other words, it is the reduction in the value of an asset over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or any other factor that reduces its usefulness.

There are a few different types of depreciation, including straight-line depreciation, double-declining balance method, and sum-of-the-years-digits method. For the purpose of this article, we'll focus on straight-line depreciation.

## Steps for Creating a Depreciation Journal Entry

Creating a depreciation journal entry involves a few simple steps. Here's a breakdown:

### Step 1: Identify the Asset

The first step is to identify the asset that you'll be depreciating. This could be any long-term asset that your business owns, such as machinery, equipment, or buildings.

For example, let's say your business just purchased a piece of equipment worth $10,000. It has a useful life of ten years and no salvage value.

### Step 2: Determine the Useful Life and Salvage Value

Next, you'll need to determine the asset's useful life and salvage value. The useful life is the number of years that the asset will be useful to your business, while the salvage value is the estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.

Using our example, the equipment has a useful life of ten years and no salvage value.

### Step 3: Calculate the Depreciation Expense

To calculate the depreciation expense, first, you'll need to determine the depreciable base. The depreciable base is the cost of the asset minus the salvage value. Using our example, the depreciable base is $10,000.

Next, you'll divide the depreciable base by the useful life of the asset. In this case, the annual depreciation expense would be $1,000.

### Step 4: Create the Depreciation Journal Entry

Finally, you'll create the depreciation journal entry. To do this, you'll need to credit the asset's accumulated depreciation account and debit the depreciation expense account.

Using our example, the journal entry would look like this:

| Account        | Debit          | Credit  |
| ----------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Depreciation Expense      | $1,000 |  |
| Accumulated Depreciation      |   | $1,000 |

## Conclusion

Creating a depreciation journal entry isn't as intimidating as it may seem at first. By following these simple steps, you can easily master the process and keep accurate financial records for your business.

Remember, keeping track of your assets' depreciation is vital for proper financial reporting and tax purposes. By staying on top of your depreciation journal entries, you can ensure that your business is operating smoothly and efficiently.

### Examples of Depreciation Expense Journal Entry
 
#### Example #1
 
Let us consider the example of a company called XYZ Ltd that bought a cake baking oven at the beginning of the year on January 1, 2018, and the oven is worth $15,000. The owner of the company estimates that the useful life of this oven is about ten years, and probably it won’t be worth anything after those ten years. Show how the journal entry for the depreciation expense will be recorded at the end of the accounting period on December 31, 2018.
 
Let us assume that the depreciation will be charged on the straight-line methodStraight-line MethodStraight Line Depreciation Method is one of the most popular methods of depreciation where the asset uniformly depreciates over its useful life and the cost of the asset is evenly spread over its useful and functional life. read more; then the annual depreciation charge can be calculated as,
 
Annual depreciation expense = (Cost of the asset – Salvage value of the assetSalvage Value Of The AssetSalvage value or scrap value is the estimated value of an asset after its useful life is over. For example, if a company's machinery has a 5-year life and is only valued $5000 at the end of that time, the salvage value is $5000.read more) / Useful life
 
= $1,500
 
Therefore, the journal entry for the depreciation expense is as shown below,

#### Example #2
 
Let us take the example of a company to calculate the depreciation expense during the year and illustrate the journal entry of the depreciation expense in the financial statements. The following facts are available:
 
- On January 1, 2018, the company bought a piece of equipment worth $6,000The equipment is estimated to have a useful life of 3 yearsThe equipment is not expected to have any salvage value at the end of its useful lifeThe company intends to follow the straight-line depreciation method over the three years of life

 
Since the company will use the equipment for the next three years, the cost can be spread across the next three years. The annual depreciation for the equipmentDepreciation For The EquipmentDepreciation on Equipment refers to the decremented value of an equipment's cost after deducting salvage value over the life of an equipment. It lowers its resale value.read more as per the straight-line method can be calculated,
 
Annual depreciation = $6,000 / 3 = $2,000 a year over the next 3 years.

- Debit depreciation expense account andCredit accumulated depreciation account

 
Let us assume that the company prepares annual financial statementsFinancial StatementsFinancial statements are written reports prepared by a company's management to present the company's financial affairs over a given period (quarter, six monthly or yearly).

### Relevance and Uses
 
From the view of accounting, accumulated depreciation is an important aspect as it is relevant for capitalized assets. Therefore, it is very important to understand that when a depreciation expense journal entry is recognized in the financial statements, the net income of the concerned company is decreased by the same amount. However, the company’s cash reserve is not impacted by the recording as depreciation is a non-cash item. Therefore, the cash balance would have been reduced at the time of the acquisition of the asset.
 
Another important aspect of depreciation is that it is an estimate based on the historical cost of the asset (not the replacement costThe Replacement CostReplacement Cost is the capital amount required to replace the current asset with a similar one at the present market rate. Usually, assets replacement occurs when their repair & maintenance charges surge beyond a reasonable level.  read more),  its expected useful life, and its probable salvage value at the time of disposal. There is a common misconception that depreciation is a method of expensing a capitalized asset over a while.
 
Nevertheless, depreciation is a way of evaluating the capitalized asset over some time due to normal usage, wear and tear of new technology, or unfavorable market conditions. The depreciation expense account and accumulated depreciation account help estimate the current value or the book value of an assetBook Value Of An AssetBook Value of Assets is the asset's value in the books of records of a company or an institution at any given instance.

On the other hand, a rental property located in a growing area may end up having a market value greater than the outstanding amount recognized in the balance sheet. It happens because of the difference in the depreciation method adopted by the market and the company.
