It was a typical Monday morning when I sat down at my HP Chromebook 14 Ak013Dx to do some work. As I opened the lid, I noticed that my Windows 10 laptop was acting slower than usual. So, I decided to troubleshoot the problem by myself. Unfortunately, I ended up erasing the entire operating system accidentally. 

All of my files, folders, and applications were suddenly gone. I was panicked. After all, my Windows 10 laptop was my primary device for work and personal tasks. I knew I had to find a solution fast, but I had no idea where to begin. Thankfully, I found a way to fix my HP Chromebook 14 Ak013Dx in minutes. 

Here's how I did it. 

First, I turned off my Chromebook and then turned it on again. As it was booting up, I pressed the "esc + refresh" keys together. This action opened the Chromebook's recovery mode. 

Next, I used a USB flash drive to create a recovery image. To do this, I visited Google's Chromebook Recovery Utility website and downloaded the utility. 

After extracting the utility, I inserted my USB drive and launched the utility. From there, I followed the instructions to create a recovery image. The process took about 10 minutes, but it was well worth it. 

Once the recovery image was created, I inserted it into my HP Chromebook 14 Ak013Dx and pressed the "ctrl + d" keys. This action initiated the Chromebook's recovery process. 

The recovery process took about 15 minutes, and after it was completed, I was prompted to set up my Chromebook again from scratch. It was like having a brand new device all over again. 

I was relieved to find that all of my files and folders were still intact in my Google Drive account. I simply logged in to my account, and everything was there waiting for me. 

In conclusion, erasing the entire Windows 10 system on my HP Chromebook 14 Ak013Dx was definitely not ideal, but thankfully, I was able to fix my Chromebook in minutes. If anyone ever finds themselves in a similar situation, I highly recommend following these steps to recover their device.


## Chosen Solution
 I accidentally erased all data and Windows laptop what can I do

 If you formatted your drive on accident, there is still a chance. Get another computer, and mount your old hard drive on it. Then, use this software to try and recover your list data: https://www.powerdatarecovery.com/lost-p...
It may or may not be successful at recovering your neccacery but it should be enough to at least get some of your data.
If it can't recover the OS, use a bootable USB stick to re-install Windows. I can provide a guide when you tell me your version of Windows.
