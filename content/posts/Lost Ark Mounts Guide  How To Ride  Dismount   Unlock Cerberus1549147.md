Are you tired of traveling on foot in Lost Ark? Do you want to ride in style with the most epic mount in the game? Look no further because we are here to guide you on how to unlock and ride Cerberus, the three-headed hound of Hades.

Cerberus is not just a mount; it is a status symbol that shows your power and prestige in the game. The process of unlocking it can be a challenging task, but the payoff is worth it. To get started, you will need to visit the Queen of the Undead in the Forgotten Temple. To reach her, you will need to have completed the main story quest up to the sixth continent.

Once you reach the Queen of the Undead, you will be given a series of quests that require you to defeat several bosses. The difficulty level of each boss varies, and you will need to have a high enough gear score to defeat them.

After completing the quests, you will receive the Cerberus mount as a reward. However, unlocking it is just the first step. You will also need to learn how to ride and dismount Cerberus.

To ride the mount, you need to open your inventory and click on the mount icon. Then select Cerberus, and you will automatically be mounted on it. While riding, Cerberus has a special ability called the "Three-Head Rush," which allows it to charge into enemies and deal massive damage.

To dismount Cerberus, simply open your inventory and click on the mount icon again. You will then return to being on foot. You can also summon and dismiss Cerberus at any time by using the shortcut key.

In conclusion, unlocking and riding Cerberus is not an easy feat, but it is a reward well deserved for your efforts. With the mount's unique abilities, you will be able to explore and battle your way through Lost Ark like never before. So what are you waiting for? Visit the Queen of the Undead and embark on a quest to unlock Cerberus now!
