Is Your iMac G5 20 Acting Strange? Discover the Mystery of the Little Folder in the Middle of Your Screen!

If you are an iMac G5 20 user, chances are you have encountered the little folder icon that appears in the middle of your screen. This icon can appear out of nowhere and leave you in a state of confusion especially when it refuses to disappear even after rebooting your computer. So, what does this little folder icon mean and how do you fix it?

The little folder icon is basically a sign that your computer is having trouble locating the start-up disk. This means that your iMac is unable to find the system files required to boot up your computer. This can happen for various reasons including hardware conflicts or corrupted system files. However, the good news is that fixing this issue is not complicated and can be done by following these simple steps.

First, ensure that your iMac is switched off and unplugged from any power source. Next, press and hold the power button for about 5 seconds. This helps to discharge any residual power left in the computer. Once you have done this, you need to locate your iMac's SuperDrive, which is usually at the right-hand side of your computer. Insert your Mac OS X install disc into the SuperDrive and switch on your computer.

As your iMac starts up, press the C key on your keyboard to boot from the install disc. This will take you to the installation screen where you will be required to select your preferred language. After selecting your language, click on the “Utilities” menu at the top of the screen and select “Disk Utility.” This will take you to a window where you will see a list of all the drives connected to your iMac.

Click on your iMac's hard drive and select the “Repair Disk Permissions” option. This will scan your computer's system files and repair any permission issues that may be causing the little folder icon to appear. Once the permission repair process is complete, click on the “Verify Disk” option to check for any other issues with your hard drive.

Once you have verified and repaired any issues with your hard drive, exit Disk Utility and click on the “Install Mac OS X” option. Follow the on-screen prompts to reinstall your operating system. Depending on the speed of your iMac, this process may take a few minutes to several hours. However, once the installation is complete, your iMac should be running smoothly without the little folder icon in sight.

In conclusion, if you are experiencing the little folder icon on your iMac G5 20, it is important to address the issue as soon as possible to avoid any further complications. By following these simple steps, you can fix the issue yourself without having to seek professional help. However, if the problem persists, it is recommended that you seek the assistance of an Apple certified technician to avoid causing any further damage to your iMac.

## Chosen Solution
 I bought that Imac G5 20 wind power on a little folder popped up with a question mark how do I fix it what do I need to buy

 What you are seeing is the system looking for its system files which would be on the internal HDD.
Reference: If your Mac doesn't start up all the way
This is a PowerPC CPU based system not like the newer Intel CPU and now Apples own M1 SoC.  Here’s a bit more detail on your system 20” iMac G5 2.1 GHz Specs
You’ll have a hard time finding parts for the model and I would strongly recommend you don’t connect it to the internet as the web browser it has won’t work with the newer HTML dialog and the OS-9 or OS-X 10.5.8 (the last version for PowerPC systems) applications are very limited.
You’ll need to find an older SATA I (1.5 Gb/s) drive to replace yours if its bad. Todays SATA III (6.0 Gb/s) drives won’t work unless it is offers auto sense technology which is becoming harder to find (review the drives spec sheet it most list the correct speed).
For sure this is a classic system! Its something one would have on a shelf as its so iconic! FYI: One is on display as the Smithsonian! It’s not one for use today like a Ford Model T wouldn’t be either.
