Gmail is an essential tool for communication and managing your projects, but it can be extremely frustrating when the platform displays the "Something went wrong" error message. This error can cause a lot of inconveniences, from delaying important emails to halting urgent projects, leaving you feeling helpless and frustrated. Here are the top five tricks to repair the issue and get your Gmail up and running in minutes.

1. Check Internet Connectivity and Gmail Account Status 
The first and most apparent step is to make sure your internet connectivity is secure, and you've signed in to your Gmail account with the right credentials. Ensure you can access other Google services like Google Drive, Hangouts, or Google Calendar. Verify if there are any issues with your Google account by visiting Google's web support portal. In case of any ongoing issues, examine Google's status dashboard, which displays real-time statuses of all services or apps.

2. Clear Your Browser cache
Clearing the browser cache is a quick and easy fix that makes your browsing experience a lot smoother. Cookies and cache that have piled up in your browser can interfere with Gmail's operations or cause it to crash, which can, in turn, trigger the "Something went wrong" error message. To clear browser cache:
    
    - For Chrome, click the three-dot menu, select "More," then "Clear Browsing Data."
    - For Firefox users, click the menu button and select "Preferences," then "Privacy & Security," and "Cookies and Site Data."

3. Turn Off Browser Extensions
Some browser extensions, such as ad-blockers and antivirus programs, can also interfere with Gmail's proper functioning, causing the "Something went wrong" error to appear. To ascertain if browser extensions are the culprits, disable them temporarily and reload Gmail. If the error disappears, you can either uninstall them permanently, whitelist Gmail while switching them back on, or try alternative extensions that are less likely to interfere with Gmail.

4. Try Accessing Gmail in Incognito or Private Mode
Incognito or Private mode allows you to surf the internet without your browsing history being recorded or your cache being saved on your device, making it an opportune way to isolate the root cause of Gmail's issue. Open an incognito or private mode tab, then open Gmail, and sign in. If Gmail works error-free, the issue may be attributed to your normal browsing habits. Try clearing your cache and browsing history or switch to a different web browser to avoid those issues.

5. Use a Different Device or Browser
Suppose none of the above methods works to solve the "Something went wrong" error. In that case, the issue may lie within the device or browser you are using. Switch to another browser like Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer. You may also try accessing Gmail on another device like a smartphone, tablet, or laptop to determine if the issue is device-specific.

Conclusion
In conclusion, dealing with Gmail's "Something went wrong" error does not have to be a frustrating experience. Follow these five troubleshoot tricks, and you will be Gmail error-free in no time. If the problem persists, you can always reach out to Gmail support forums or Google's support team for assistance. Remember, clearing your browsing data or disabling your extensions is no magic cure, and one or several solutions may be needed to fix the issue. Thanks for reading, and good luck!

Moreover, the add-ons available in Opera can help you handle your emails conveniently, such as getting notifications, composing messages, and seeing Gmail in the toolbar in extensions.
 
Opera has great speed and sync capabilities for you to attach files, import data and manage all your devices where you have the Gmail app installed.
 
The best thing about this search engine is that you can use it anytime your default browser generates problems, and it’s a great alternative when you get the Something went wrong alert on your Google account.
