# Say Goodbye to Car Troubles! Learn the Easy Step-by-Step Guide to Replace Your Honda Civic Spark Plugs for a Smoother Ride in 2019!

If you own a Honda Civic, there's no denying that it's an excellent car that provides a comfortable and smooth ride every time you hit the road. However, like most cars, it requires routine maintenance to keep it running efficiently, and one area that needs attention is the spark plugs. Replacing your Honda Civic spark plugs is an easy DIY task that can significantly improve your car's performance and mileage. In this article, we'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to replace them and keep your Honda Civic running smoothly in 2019!

## Tools You'll Need

Before we dive into the steps on how to replace the spark plugs, there are tools you'll need to get the job done. These include:

- Spark plug socket (size: 5/8" or 16mm)
- A socket wrench and extension (if needed)
- Spark plug gap tool
- Dielectric grease
- Torque wrench

## Step 1: Locate Your Spark Plugs

Open your Honda Civic's hood and look for the four spark plug wires that are attached to the valve cover. Gently pull the wires off and set them aside in a safe place where they won't get lost or mixed up.

## Step 2: Remove the Old Spark Plugs

Use a spark plug socket and wrench to remove the old spark plugs. Once you loosen the spark plugs, carefully remove them from the engine. Inspect the spark plugs' condition, and if they look worn out, it's time to replace them.

## Step 3: Check the Gap

Before inserting the new spark plugs, check the gap to ensure it's correct for your Honda Civic model. You can use a spark plug gap tool to check and adjust the gap until it's right. The gap's size should be 0.43 inches or 11 mm.

## Step 4: Apply Dielectric Grease

Apply a small amount of dielectric grease to the new spark plugs' threads. This will help the spark plugs resist moisture and keep them from getting frozen in the engine.

## Step 5: Install the New Spark Plugs

Carefully insert the new spark plugs into the engine and tighten them with the spark plug socket and wrench. Be careful not to overtighten the spark plugs, as this can cause damage to the engine.

## Step 6: Reconnect the Spark Plug Wires

Gently replace the four spark plug wires onto the corresponding spark plugs. Be sure to push them in until you hear a click to ensure they're connected correctly.

## Step 7: Test Drive Your Honda Civic

After replacing the spark plugs, take your Honda Civic on a test drive to see how it performs. You should notice an immediate improvement in your car's performance, such as smoother acceleration and better gas mileage.

## Conclusion

Replacing the spark plugs in your Honda Civic is a straightforward process that can make a huge difference in your car's performance. By following these step-by-step instructions, you'll be able to do it yourself, without having to take your car to a mechanic. Say goodbye to car troubles and enjoy a smoother ride in 2019!

## Introduction
 
Based on how often a vehicle is used and the kind of the car, spark plugs should be replaced in intervals of 20,000 to 100,000 miles. Old or damaged spark plugs ultimately cause engine damage. Hard starts, reduced gas mileage, engine misfiring, and lack of acceleration are the symptoms of defective spark plugs.
 
Before using this guide, make sure the engine and cylinder heads are cold. Also, make sure you repeat the steps for installing all four spark plugs before reinstalling the engine cover.
