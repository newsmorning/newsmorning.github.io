## Chosen Solution
 I would like to know what kind of adhesive they used on the Note 20 Ultra. I have Flintstone fingers and so now I have a repair to do.

 Well that device is quite new so replacement parts may be unavailable for a little bit. With that being said I tried finding pre-cut adhesive but can’t seem to find it. If we repair shops can’t find precut adhesive, we’ll use this: Tesa 61395 Tape
It’s made of the same tape as the pre-cut stuff we use but it’s not like factory. You can use some heat and some pressure to kind of cure the adhesive to make a good bond.
just keep in mind that since you damaged your device, and you’ll be opening it up, it will lose the liquid resistance.
