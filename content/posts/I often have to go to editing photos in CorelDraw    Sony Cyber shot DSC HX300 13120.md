## Chosen Solution
 By the nature of my work, I often have to go to editing photos in CorelDraw. But now I thought a lot about the problem with opening a file with a processed photo. Something in it, apparently, went wrong with the last salvation, and now I see something incomprehensible, and not what I saved the last time. I don't know what happened to the file, but I urgently need to return everything to its original position. How to do it?

 You may repair corel draw file via backup copy in the following or due to CorelDraw Online
Corel makes a .BAK backup file that has the same name and is usually located in the same folder as the original file, but can also be located in the /Programs/Corel/Programs/Draw folder.
When a file is corrupted or otherwise damaged, find the .BAK file, open it, and copy it (save as) over the original corrupted file.
