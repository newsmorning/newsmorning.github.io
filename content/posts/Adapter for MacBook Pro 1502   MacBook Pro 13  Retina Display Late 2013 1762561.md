## Chosen Solution
 Hi friends,
My SSD drive for my MacBook Pro A1502 is not working anymore.
I’m trying to buy a new one but it’s a little bit expensive. I have a 1 TB mSATA SSD from Samsung  840 EVO.
Is it possible to buy an adapter or converter so I will be able to use this mSATA drive with my MacBook Pro A 1502?
I tried to look around on the web, but becoming more and more confused.
Best regards

 yes you can
is your model using the regular ssd or the flash storage ssd ?

 Sorry to say I don’t recommend using these adapters as some or just junk!
The best thing here is to get the correct Apple SSD or one of the 3rd party makers either OWC or Transcend.
Here’s a good write up that explains the different SSD Apple has used and one of the reasons this is not a simple task The Ultimate Guide to Apple’s Proprietary SSDs
