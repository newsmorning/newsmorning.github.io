## Chosen Solution
 Last night i was learning a new software "3ds max" 2014 version on my laptop, after about an hour the program stopped responding, maybe it was due to the increasing geometry of the model ?..
At this time I thought to take a break, so I ignored it for a few minutes and started watching news on the phone...
But after a few mins there was the "bluescreen" it was stuck at 0%
I didn't touch the lappy , thinking it will solve the problem on its own ...
After an hour there was no progress it was stuck at 0%
So I turned off the lappy with the power button, went to sleep.
Next morning (today) I tried to turn it on but my laptop is not able to detect my harddisk, I tried "bios" "boot menu" and even opened the laptop to check for the lose cables, but nothing seems to work.
Is my harddisk really dead ? Is there a way to recover the data ?
How can I avoid this in future ?
Is there a way to fix this, that data was my important for my job

 The blue screen is an error screen displayed on a Windows computer system following a fatal system error. Did you see any error code with the blue screen?
If the computer is completely dead, you still have a chance to recover date stored in it.
