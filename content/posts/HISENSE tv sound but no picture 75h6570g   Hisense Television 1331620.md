Title: You'll Never Believe What Happened When We Turned On Our Hisense TV - Sound But No Picture?!

Introduction:
A TV is one of the essential appliances in every household, and we all expect it to work seamlessly. But, what if you turn on your Hisense TV and discover that there is sound but no picture? This can be frustrating and confusing for anyone, especially when you have plans to watch your favourite show or game. In this article, we will take a deeper look at this issue and how it can be resolved.

What Causes Sound But No Picture on Hisense TV?
The primary reason why your Hisense TV is producing sound but no picture is a disconnected or faulty cable. This could be a loose HDMI or component cable connection, which can result in no video output. Sometimes, it could be an issue with the TV's hardware components or a software glitch, which can cause the display to turn off.

Steps to Fix Sound But No Picture on Hisense TV:
The good news is, fixing this issue is not as complicated as it appears. You can try the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Check the Cable Connection
Ensure that all cables connected to your TV are properly inserted and tightened. If you notice loose connections, remove and re-insert them until they are secure.

2. Restart Your TV
Sometimes, restarting your TV can solve a lot of problems. Turn off your Hisense TV, unplug it from the power source, wait for a few minutes, and plug it back in. Then, turn it on and check if there's a picture.

3. Check the Display Settings
Make sure that your Hisense TV is set to the correct input source. If you have multiple devices connected to your TV, make sure the correct input source is selected. Navigate to the TV's settings menu, and check the display and resolution settings.

4. Update Your TV's Software
It's essential to ensure that your TV's software is up-to-date. Check for any updates and install them if there are any.

5. Call Hisense Customer Support
If none of the above steps works, you can contact Hisense customer support for further assistance.

In conclusion, experiencing sound but no picture on a Hisense TV is a common issue that can be fixed with simple troubleshooting steps. Always ensure that all cables are correctly connected, restart your TV, check display settings, update the software, and if none of that works, contact customer support.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a 75 inch hisense tv ( 75h6570g ). I get sound on the tv but no picture unless I hold a light up to it. I’ve taken the tv apart and replaced the power board and the issue is still the same. I can hear sound and only see a picture when I hold a light up to the tv. What should I do next ?

 Hi @brokentvmatt ,
Seems like you have a backlight problem.
This could be either faulty LED strips or since you have replaced the power board, the mainboard telling the power board not to turn on the backlights for some reason.
Without a schematic (I can’t find one) to know where to check voltage signals between the mainboard and power board and as the audio is working and you can “see” video, to me it points to the problem being either the mainboard or the backlights.
Since you have the TV dis-assembled, consider getting a backlight tester (supplier example only) and connecting it to the disconnected LED power cable, (assuming it is connected to the power board) to test the backlights, independent of the TV being powered on.
If all the backlights turn on, then it’s looking like a mainboard problem
