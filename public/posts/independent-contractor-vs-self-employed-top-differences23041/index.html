These two terms are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same legal terms.\nIn this article, we’ll discuss the top differences between independent contractors and self-employed workers. After reading, you’ll have a clearer understanding of each for your business.\nDefinition:\nIn brief, an independent contractor is hired as a non-employee to perform a specific task or service for a company. A self-employed individual, or “sole proprietor,” is an individual who operates a business, whether it’s on a small or large scale, for-profit or not-for-profit organization.\nControl–Who’s in charge? One of the most significant differences between independent contractors and self-employed or sole proprietors is the control they have over their work. In general, the self-employed person has full control over their work, schedule, and how they complete it. The independent contractor has less control over their work, leaving many of the details up to their clients’ whims.\nTaxpayer ID number/SSN Self-employed individuals typically operate as “sole proprietors” and file their taxes using their Social Security number. In contrast, an independent contractor files taxes using a tax identification number or SSN, depending on their business structure.\nBenefits Self-employed individuals have very flexible benefit options, including retirement savings, medical, life insurance, vacation, and sick time. An independent contractor receives significantly less in benefits and typically has more limited choices in these areas due to their status as a non-employee.\nPayroll Taxes The independent contractor must pay all applicable payroll taxes, including FICA, FUTA, Social Security, and Medicare. The self-employed individual pays a self-employment tax on their net income.\nContractual Agreements Independent contractors typically work under a contract or agreement, which outlines their duties, the scope of work, payment terms, and other essential details. Self-employed individuals do not necessarily need a contract, as they have more autonomy over their work.\nConclusion\nThe differences between independent contractors and self-employed individuals are relatively easy to see in practice, and both have pros and cons depending on your professional needs. Understanding these differences could help you make the best decision when choosing your status. Knowing the difference is the first step towards success in your business.\nDifference between Independent Contractor and Self Employed Key Takeaways\nSelf-employed are individuals who can dictate their working method and the work they need to do. For example, all independent contractors are self-employed, but not all self-employed people are individual contractors.These job categories are similar in nature except for a small difference that self-employment does not always offer services to the general public.Individual contractors may require special licenses or educational requirements necessary for the job undertaken.
