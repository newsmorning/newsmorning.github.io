Is Your AC Clutch Failing? Discover the Shocking Truth About the 1998-2001 Nissan Altima!

AC problems are some of the most frustrating issues you can face as a car owner, and a failing AC clutch just adds to the headache. Unfortunately, many Nissan Altima owners from the 1998-2001 model years have found themselves dealing with this exact issue. In this article, we'll take a closer look at why the AC clutch on these vehicles tends to fail, symptoms to watch out for, and what you can do to fix it.

Let's start with why the AC clutch tends to fail on these vehicles. The short answer is that it's a design flaw. The original AC clutch on these cars was made with a weaker material, which means it's more likely to fail over time. This is due to a lack of proper cooling on the contact surface. Additionally, the bearing can wear out quickly due to poor lubrication. All of this adds up to a problematic AC clutch that can lead to headaches for Nissan Altima owners.

So how do you know if your AC clutch is failing? There are a few symptoms to watch out for. The first and most obvious is that your AC won't blow cold air. This happens when the clutch can't engage, which means that the compressor can't kick in and start the cooling process. Additionally, you may notice unusual noises coming from your AC system. This could be a result of a worn bearing or an improperly functioning clutch.

If you suspect that your AC clutch is failing, it's important to address the issue quickly. The longer you wait, the worse the problem will become. Not only will you be uncomfortable while driving, but you could also end up causing additional damage to your vehicle. The good news is that there are a few solutions to this problem.

The first option is to replace the clutch with a higher quality aftermarket part. This will cost you a bit more upfront, but it should solve the problem once and for all. Additionally, you can replace the entire AC compressor if necessary. This is a more expensive option, but it's sometimes necessary if the compressor is damaged beyond repair. Finally, you can opt to install a bypass pulley kit. This kit essentially removes the compressor from the system entirely, which means you'll no longer have working AC, but you'll avoid the cost of replacing the clutch or compressor altogether.

In conclusion, if you own a 1998-2001 Nissan Altima and you're having AC problems, it's very likely that your AC clutch is failing. Due to a design flaw, these vehicles are prone to this issue, and it's important to address it as soon as possible. Keep an eye out for symptoms like warm air blowing from your vents or unusual noises coming from your AC system. And remember, there are a few options for fixing the problem, so don't hesitate to reach out to a mechanic or auto parts dealer for advice.

## Chosen Solution
 I have replaced my relay & thermo control amplifier, compressor spins not locked up. I don’t know what else to try

 @ladycat999  let’ s see if we can all get this done. We may suggest things you already tried etc. so bear with us. When in doubt etc. post some pictures of what you see or where you are stuck etc. Use this guide for that. Please make sure that you have enough refrigerant. Your AC compressor will not turn on if you do not have enough.
Start with check fuse #39 and check for power on it. Check for power on the AC relay, the thermal protector (check continuity between the two terminals) and finally check for power on the compressor connector. You could also apply 12V+ to the connector for the Yellow/black wire and see if it works.
