If you're an iPhone user, you've likely come across a frustrating issue: unresponsive keys. Nothing's more annoying than trying to type a message or make a call and finding that your iPhone's screen isn't responding to your touch. This issue can be caused by a number of things, including software glitches or hardware malfunction. 

Recently, we received an iPhone 5S with unresponsive keys that didn't seem to have any obvious cause. The device was in good condition, and there were no signs of damage or exposure to water. We couldn't figure out what was wrong with the phone until we did some investigating. And what we found might shock you!

After opening the iPhone, we discovered the culprit: a tiny spider! The spider had made its way inside the phone and had camped out on the touch screen controller board. The spider's web had bridged the connections between components on the board, causing the screen to malfunction. 

It's not uncommon for insects to make their way inside electronic devices. The warmth and darkness of the interior of smartphones, tablets, and laptops can be an inviting environment for spiders and other bugs. And while they don't pose any serious threat to the devices themselves, they can cause issues like the one we encountered with this iPhone 5S.

So, how did we solve the problem? We carefully removed the spider and its web with a pair of tweezers and a toothbrush. We then cleaned the touch screen controller board with a soft, dry cloth to ensure that there was no residue left behind. Once the board was clean, we reassembled the phone and powered it on. And the unresponsive keys issue was completely gone! 

It's hard to believe that something as small as a spider could cause such a frustrating problem with an iPhone. But it just goes to show how intricate and delicate these devices can be. If you're experiencing unresponsive keys or any other issue with your iPhone, it's essential to take it to a professional for repair. DIY repair attempts can cause further damage and ultimately cost more in the long run.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing unresponsive keys or any other odd issue with your iPhone, get it checked by a professional. And if you live in an area with a lot of spiders, be sure to keep your devices clean and dust-free. You never know when a tiny visitor might take up residence inside your phone!

## Chosen Solution
 I have an iPhone 5s w/ unresponsive keys r/q/p when vertical. When I turn on it's side and the key's shift to the larger keyboard I can use those keys. It seems like a bad digitizer. I bought the replacement screen through iFixit and they sent another screen as after describing the issue this was the tech's thought as well. Now on the third screen/digitizer (original and 2 replacements) with the same issues. I've ensured that software is up to date. Any suggestions?

 Sounds like a damaged digitizer FPC connector. A new one will have to be soldered on. If you are unable to, see if there is a shop equipped and capable of microsoldering the connector. If not, shoot me an email (address is on my profile) and I am more than happy to do it for you.
