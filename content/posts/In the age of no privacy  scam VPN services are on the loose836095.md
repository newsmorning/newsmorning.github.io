Title:
Protect Your Online Identity: Unveiling the Widespread Scam of VPN Services in the Era of Zero Privacy!

Introduction:
As we become increasingly dependent on technology, our online presence grows exponentially more important. But with the ascendance of the internet also comes a host of security threats, from hacking to phishing to identity theft. That's why it's more important than ever to protect our online identity.

One of the most popular ways to do so is by using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service, but not all VPNs are created equal. Some are actually scams, designed to rip off unsuspecting users or even compromise their security. This article will examine the widespread scam of VPN services in the era of zero privacy and provide tips on how to safeguard your online identity.

Body:
First, let's define what a VPN is and why it's important. In short, a VPN is a service that allows you to encrypt your online data so that it's inaccessible to hackers or anyone else trying to intercept it. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi hotspots or accessing sensitive information, such as bank accounts or credit card details. It also helps to protect your identity and location, making it more difficult for third parties to track your online activities.

However, not all VPNs are created equal. Some are actually scams designed to steal your personal information or infect your device with malware. These fraudulent VPN services often entice users with free trials or low subscription fees but fail to deliver on their promises. Instead, they may be logging your data, selling it to third parties, or creating fake profiles to hack into your device.

So, how can you spot a fake VPN service? Here are some red flags to watch out for:

1. Free VPNs: As the saying goes, "if something seems too good to be true, it probably is." Many free VPN services may be designed to lure in unsuspecting users and collect their data for nefarious purposes.

2. Limited functionality: Check to see if the VPN service offers a range of features, including protocols for different levels of encryption and kill-switch capabilities. If it only provides basic encryption, it may not offer adequate protection.

3. No logs policy: If the VPN claims to have a no-log policy, thoroughly research the company to ensure they're not logging your data.

4. Seller details: Look for the seller's website, country of origin or registered office, and contact details - these should all be readily available so you can verify the VPN company's legitimacy.

5. Reviews: Check online reviews of the VPN service you're considering, particularly from trusted sources such as tech magazines, independent review sites, or peers who have used the service.

Conclusion:
As we continue to rely on and engage with technology, it's critical to safeguard our personal information and online identity. While VPNs can offer an added layer of security, it's important to choose a reputable service and thoroughly research it before committing your information or payment. By taking the necessary precautions, you can protect your online identity and prevent yourself from becoming a victim of a scam.

As a computer user, which is almost everyone at this point, it’s important to not only know how the constantly changing legal landscape affects your digital rights but how the opportunists out there are trying to take advantage, too. And ever since the GOP in Congress killed privacy rules, a variety of scam companies have arisen to do just that.
 
### FCC Regulations Killed
 
Last week, the United States Congress voted to kill FCC regulations and President Trump signed the bill into law. Those regulations prevented ISPs from selling your personal browsing history to third parties through “trusted partners”. One of the results? Interest in VPN services soared, something scam companies have noticed and are taking advantage of.
 
### MySafeVPN
 
One of the latest scams is related to hacks of the Plex and Boxee forums which exposed the email addresses of forum users. Everything points to MySafeVPN as the culprit,  a phony web service that began sending messages to Plex and Boxee users faking an affiliation with their services. Thanks to an investigation by VICE, the service was proven to be nothing more than a scam.
 
Talking about scams, nothing can protect you better from this type of fake security services than a true VPN tool. In case you think about using one, we strongly recommend Cyberghost (77% flash sale). With over 10 million users worldwide and 600 servers, this tool offers a great support to everyone needing online privacy. 
 
### Caution is advised
 
This is a serious problem. If you or anyone you know is considering purchasing a VPN, it’s strongly advised to thoroughly review that company’s history. Remember the old saying: “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.”
 
Keep an eye on businesses that advertise free, low-cost, or a well-affiliated VPN product. While it’s natural that more and more companies are going to offer VPN services, it’s important to stay vigilant regardless.
 
In addition be aware of some of the limitations involved with the use of a VPN. Services like Netflix may not function properly, web surfing can get slower, torrents might not work at optimal levels, and so on. A good VPN provider should be able to mitigate these shortcomings if you do the proper research beforehand to find one.
 
Despite Congress’ decision to kill FCC’s privacy rules, this law is very unpopular in the US. But like many other unpopular laws there, there doesn’t seem like there’s much in the way of an effective opposition at this particular moment.
