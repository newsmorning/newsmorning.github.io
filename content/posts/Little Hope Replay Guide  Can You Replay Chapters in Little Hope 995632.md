## Can you replay character in Little Hope?
 
Unlike Watch Dogs Legion, Little Hope has a replay chapter feature, letting its players play the same character again and again in a hope of changing its outcome rather than starting the game from the beginning.
 
Notably, there are certain conditions that need to be fulfilled to replay chapters in Little Hope. One is that your progress playing alone and with friends appears to be independent. You can only replay the chapter in Little Hope of if you have played through the game in Move Night Mode with friends. In order to replay character in a single-mode, you will have to start the game from its beginning.
 
You need to play through the game alone and with friends if you want all of the game’s scenes accessible in both modes.
 
The second is that you would not be able to play through scenes in isolation. When you select a sense to play from, you will be given the option to override your current save or make a new one. If you opt to ovverise your save, you can’t get access to all the scenes again until you complete your playthrough from the scene you have just chosen. It would be better to make a new save while using scene selection and then you can load your original save to gain access to all the chapters again.
