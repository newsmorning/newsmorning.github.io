Shocking truth revealed about Demurrage charges in shipping: Currency fluctuations leading to massive losses - with real examples!

Shipping is a vital component of global trade, facilitating the movement of goods from one part of the world to another. However, shipping companies face various challenges that impact their profitability, and one of these challenges is demurrage charges.

Demurrage is a penalty charged to the owner of a shipment for a delay in the unloading or loading of goods beyond the allotted time. These fees are determined by a few factors, including the size of the ship, the time spent in the port, and the type of product being shipped.

Recently, there has been a shocking revelation about demurrage charges in the shipping industry: currency fluctuations are leading to massive losses for shipping companies. When there is a fluctuation in currency exchange rates, these changes can have a significant impact on shipping costs, leading to unforeseen demurrage charges.

To understand this better, let us consider an example. A shipping company in the United States purchases goods from a supplier in Europe, and the transaction is made in euros. At the time of purchase, the exchange rate is $1.15 per euro, and the total cost of the goods is €50,000, which translates to $57,500.

However, by the time the goods arrive in the US, the exchange rate has changed, and $1 now equals €0.90. This means that the actual cost of the goods is now $55,000, which is $2,500 less than the amount the shipping company had budgeted.

If the shipment is delayed at the port, demurrage charges will kick in, and the shipping company will be penalized for the extra time the goods spend in the port. This penalty is calculated based on the total cost of the goods, which, in this case, is $57,500. Therefore, even though the shipping company had only budgeted for $55,000, they will now have to pay demurrage charges based on a higher amount, incurring an additional cost of $2,500.

This example demonstrates how currency fluctuations can lead to massive losses for shipping companies, as they are forced to pay demurrage charges based on a higher value of the shipment than they had budgeted for.

This issue is not limited to one or two shipping companies. Instead, it is a widespread problem affecting the entire shipping industry. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) has highlighted the issue, noting that fluctuations in currency exchange rates are leading to increased costs for shipping companies.

In conclusion, demurrage charges are a necessary evil in the shipping industry, but currency fluctuations should not lead to massive losses for shipping companies. To mitigate this risk, shipping companies should consider using foreign exchange hedging instruments to lock in currency exchange rates and ensure that they are not exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations.

Additionally, freight forwarders and shippers should work together to optimize shipping routes and minimize delays, which will reduce the likelihood of incurring demurrage charges. By taking these steps, shipping companies can protect their businesses from unforeseen losses due to currency fluctuations and demurrage charges.

Cargo owners charge this cost as a means of maintaining profitability. In this way, vessel owners can generate revenue. In the same way, it acts as a holding or carrying cost for the asset owners. Holding charge encourages owners to hold the assets to appreciate future value. However, it adds an extra cost to the consignee affecting the surplus profits. 
 

 
### 
Key Takeaways

 
- Demurrage is a charge shippers (importers, exporters) must pay if they fail to load or unload items in or from the ship. While in the case of commodity and currency trading, demurrage is a charge owners have to pay for holding that asset (money, gold, silver).If shippers exceed the free time, the vessel owner charges this fee to the shippers on a per-day basis. This charge differs from port to port and country to country.

 
### Demurrage Explained
 
Demurrage has two meanings. It acts as a penalty for holding assets and goods. In the case of cargo, it is the penalty traders pay when they fail to unload goods within the laytime period. It is the inverse of dispatch. For currencies and commodities, it is the cost of holding that asset for a specific time. 
 
The term ‘demurrage’ derives from an old French word, ‘demeurer,’ which means lingering, staying, or remaining. German economist Silvio Gesell advocated this idea in the early 20th century. Gesell stated that idle money attracts no extra wealth. Thus, people should add a holding cost while lending currency to other people.
 
As money inflates over time, it will result in passive income for the lender. The Federal Maritime proposed the demurrage fees for the importers and exporters in 1984, revised in 2014. Various charter agreements, governed by charter parties, devise rules, and demurrage means a failure to abide by them.
 
In finance, demurrage has many uses and applications. Let us look at the uses in different areas:
 
#### #1 – Shipping
 
Vessel owners charge shippers holding costs for using land and equipment (ship). This demurrage container attracts a charge when the shipper exceeds the allocated free time. However, the owner can only claim a penalty if the ship or vessel is full. 
 
#### #2 – Currency Trading
 
For currencies, it is the cost of holding the currency for a stipulated time. Higher demurrage costs lead to the rising velocity of money, making it less appealing to investors. It discourages the investors from holding the money instead investing in yielding assets. However, certain economists argue that denying demurrage costs can help them inflate their net worth. 
 
#### #3 – Commodities Trading
 
Commodity trading is the cost of holding commodity assets like gold and silver. This charge can be in the form of insurance and storage charges (locker). Investors might hesitate to hold the commodities if there are high demurrage fees. Also, borrowers can borrow money against precious metals. 
 
### Demurrage Charges 
 
The holding charge differs for every shipper, currency holder, and commodity owner. In the case of shipping, the Federal Maritime allows vessel owners to charge holding charges on the shipper if they exceed the laytime period. The carrier owner will inform the shipper about the vessel’s arrival for easy cargo pickup. 
 
Normally, the free time allocated to shippers is 3-4 days. If it exceeds the laytime period, a penalty arises. For example, if the shipper exceeds free time for 1 to 4 days, the penalty would be $245. Likewise, for 4-5 days, the shipper has to pay $290 to the cargo owner. From the discharge date of the container to the gate-in empty date, the owner calculates the vessel’s operating costs. Cargo owners calculate the charge on a per-day basis. The daily holding charges range from $75 to $150 per container. 
 
For currencies, the bank levies holding charges in account charges. The average holding charges range from $7 to $10 per month. According to a report by Xchange, the holding charge increased by 104% compared to 2020. The average holding cost among the major ports was $1219 in 2021. While in the case of commodities, the holder must pay the penalty in the form of storage costs. The average penalty charges are 1.25-2.25%. 
 
### Examples
 
Let us look at some demurrage examples to comprehend the concept better.
 
#### Example #1
 
Suppose Alexa is the owner of textile mills. She imports linen cloth from Marco, who lives in Italy, for his production. On July 15, 2022, Marco exported the order to Houston. And on August 20, the ship arrived at Houston port. The vessel owner informed Alexa about the arrival, but there was no response. Finally, after three-four days, he contacted the owner regarding unloading her items.
 
Since she arrived after the allocated free time, she was liable for a penalty. Similarly, the vessel owner would have also charged the demurrage container if Marco had taken the time to load items. 
 
#### Example #2
 
In 2022, the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) announced the hike in demurrage and detention (D&D) charges. The top highest charging ports worldwide are in the United States, including New York port, Long beach port, and other such ports. The average holding cost at these ports is $2,210 to $3,182.

The owner or the person entitled to receive the goods is responsible for the penalty. As per the Federal Maritime Commission, the shipper is solely responsible for these charges.
 
Following are the tips to avoid detention charges:– Negotiate and understand the shipping (Bill of lading) contract– Clear all the custom duties– Manage the schedule properly.– Consider shipper-owned containers (SOCs) instead of carrier-owned containers (COCs).
 
To calculate the holding charge, multiply the delay days by the demurrage rate. This rate differs across various ports and countries. However, the highest rate prevails in the United States. 
 
Detention is the charge for delay in sending or receiving the items to or from the port terminal. In contrast, a holding charge is a penalty for delayed loading items on the ship.
