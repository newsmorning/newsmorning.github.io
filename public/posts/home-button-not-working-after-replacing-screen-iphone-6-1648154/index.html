When it comes to smartphones, it’s no secret that iPhones are some of the most popular devices in the market. However, accidents do happen, and sometimes, despite our best efforts, we end up with a cracked screen. When this occurs, getting the screen replaced is often the best solution. However, what you might not know is that this solution can sometimes lead to unexpected problems, particularly when it comes to replacing an iPhone 6 screen.\nYou might be asking yourself, “What could possibly go wrong when I replace my iPhone 6 screen?” Well, the answer lies in the home button. This button is used to navigate and interact with your phone properly, so it’s essential to ensure that it’s working correctly after a screen replacement. Unfortunately, in many cases, replacing the screen can cause the home button to malfunction, which can lead to a frustrating experience when using your device.\nSo, why exactly does the home button stop working after replacing the iPhone 6 screen? To understand this, we need to take a closer look at how the home button works with the phone. The iPhone 6 uses a touch ID sensor, which is located on the home button. When you press down on the home button, the sensor reads your fingerprint, which unlocks your device or verifies your identity when making purchases. During the screen replacement process, the original home button is removed from the device, and a new screen and home button assembly are installed.\nNow here is where the problem comes in when installing the new home button. The Touch ID sensor’s encryption is unique and is integrated into the logic board, which means that any home button replacement has to be performed by an Apple authorized technician. If you use a third-party repair service, they can replace the home button, but the Touch ID feature will be disabled. This is because Apple has designed the Touch ID feature to be secure, and they are the only ones who can ensure that it’s working correctly. Without this encryption, your home button will no longer be able to read your fingerprint, making the feature redundant.\nFurthermore, in cases where you do find an authorized technician, they can only replace the screen and the home button assembly if they are together. This means that if there is damage to the home button or the buttons on the right side of the device, they will have to be replaced as a group. This can be costly for users, especially in cases where the buttons are working correctly.\nIn conclusion, it’s essential to understand the risks involved when replacing your iPhone 6 screen. While it may seem like a straightforward fix, there are intricacies involved, particularly with the home button. You must ensure that you use authorized repair service providers to avoid the malfunction of your device’s essential features like the home button. Finally, it’s also worth noting that the cost of replacing the home button and the screen assembly can add up, and you must be prepared for these costs before proceeding with the repair.\nChosen Solution Hi! I just replaced the screen on my wife’s phone after it was cracked. Everything’s working OK now except for the Home button. It’s totally unresponsive right now. I disconnected and reconnected all the cables on the front plate and I’m still getting the problem. Enabling Assistive touch as a workaround works, but I’d like to have a functioning Touch ID and Home button. I’m wondering what I could have done wrong that could be fixed I’ve seen plenty of issues that refer to Touch ID not working after this operation, but nothing that covers the whole Home button being dead. Any ideas?\nI replaced a screen on my 6+ and the Home button stopped working, I also replaced the shield/ribbon as well but still no Home button, TouchID works fine though….\nThis happened to me once. My issue was that I damaged the cable under the lcd shield that ran to the home button. I could not restore my iphone since it gave me an error 53. I would suggest you to read this as it was helpful on the topic: http://vkrepair.com/iphone-6-error-53/\nDid you yank the home button off the old display by the flex cable like people do in youtube videos? If so you probably tore it. Another common failure point is that flex that runs behind the plate will get torn where it attaches to the back of the screen with adhesive\nIt is likely that the bridging cable under the display shield is damaged. Replace the cable. If the home button unit itself is damaged, you’re in trouble.\nFor future reference, use some heat to remove the prox/front camera cable, the home button cable connected to the plate, and the home button cable itself. These are usually the results of not doing it\nI replaced my screen and used the original home button with the new screen. The touch id and the home button were working just fine for three months. Then one day I woke up to the iphone’s touch id not working and the battery draining rapidly. Something mysterious happened from the time I went to bed to the time I woke up that caused a fault with the phone. So I don’t believe I damaged the ribbon cable. I can’t remember if I had done a SW update. I have a suspicion that a replacement screen can be incompatible and cause the problem. If you read the apple support page for error 53 it says… “For example, an unauthorized or faulty screen replacement could cause … error 53” I find the wording very interesting… So and unauthorized screen replacement in itself can cause the problem! interesting….\nMy iPhone 6 home button and touch I’d aren’t working after I got a new cable for it. I believe the problem is on the actual logic board where you plug the cable into from the screen to the little plug chip on the phone. It seems to be damaged. How the !\u0026\u0026* dies one fix that problem smh\nIf you have damaged the small chip section that plugs into the cable that runs up the back of the screen then, you are most probably screwed, you can get a new home button but will lose any “Touch” features of the phone as any new home button wont come with a touch sensor. At least Apple have updated the iOS so it doesnt brick the phones anymore but just disabled the “Touch” side…\nThere is a tiny plate behind the touch connector on the original screen, just move it to the new screen and enjoy your life ;)\nhello plz Check this\nWell I’m just gonna be straight… You probably broke it by accident, you can’t do a whole lot about it, it happends sometimes when you don’t know about your super powers and then you just destroy the cable. I’m not gonna go so much in detail (according to some wizzkids it is possible to repair I guess but that’s way too hard), I think you just need to buy a new one and tell your wife it was just an accident. Hope you can do something with my awnser :-)\nHi! I’ve just encountered the same problem. I bought the full assembly kit with all the pieces exept the home button (this one: https://eustore.ifixit.com/en/Parts/iPho… ), and after replacing the home button, this not wants to know of work. So I repleaced the full shield and the cable, without separating him from the shield, and put it on the new screen, and everythings works fine now :D. I followed this guide iPhone 6 LCD and Digitizer Replacement , you can avoid the part where the guy remove the front camera, i’ve just removed the camera shield. Hope this will help you!\nIf you damaged the ribbon, just buy a new one on Ebay, they’re very cheap… Update (03/20/2019) I replaced the screen on my iphone 7 only for the home button not to work after; I went on ebay and bought a new one, was like $7, working to specs.\n","wordCount":"1379","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Howard Gonzalea"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-not-working-after-replacing-screen-iphone-6-1648154/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe what happens when you replace your Iphone 6 screen - the home button stops working!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 18, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1379 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Howard Gonzalea</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=you-wont-believe-what-happens-when-you-replace-your-iphone-6-screen---the-home-button-stops-working>You Won&rsquo;t Believe What Happens When You Replace Your iPhone 6 Screen - The Home Button Stops Working!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-wont-believe-what-happens-when-you-replace-your-iphone-6-screen---the-home-button-stops-working>#</a></h1><p>When it comes to smartphones, it&rsquo;s no secret that iPhones are some of the most popular devices in the market.
