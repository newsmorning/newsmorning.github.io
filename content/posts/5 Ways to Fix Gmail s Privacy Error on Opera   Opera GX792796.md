Step 1: Clear Your Browser's Cache and Cookies

In this article, we explore the Gmail privacy error on Opera. The ad-supported web is undergoing significant changes, and today’s internet browser has emerged as a critical battlefield for end-user privacy. 
 
- The Gmail privacy error on Opera can be triggered by an outdated browser, an out-of-sync computer data and time, or malware.
 - Before starting any of the recommended solutions, we recommend a quick browser and PC reboot.
 - Because Opera and the Opera GX have very similar interfaces, the solutions for both to solve this privacy error are almost always identical.

 
- Optimize resource usage: your RAM memory is used more efficiently than in other browsers
 - Enhanced privacy: free and unlimited VPN integrated
 - No ads: built-in Ad Blocker speeds up loading of pages and protects against data-mining
 - Gaming friendly: Opera GX is the first and best browser for gaming
 - Download Opera | Opera GX

 
While Chrome remains, by some distance, the most popular web browser in the market, some other alternatives provide superior privacy and versatility.
 
This includes Opera and its gaming edition, Opera GX. Its Tracker blocker, for example, prevents well-known internet trackers such as tracking pixels, analytic scripts, and other data collecting techniques from being used.
 
Additionally, a free VPN encrypts data transmitted back and forth and routes it via a distant server. Unfortunately, few users have reported issues using the VPN, but these are minor, and you can fix VPN issues on the Opera browser very quickly. 
 
In all, Opera is a robust browser, that comes with an extensive range of personalization and customization options. Aside from the privacy feature, we love its UI, which makes every major tool easily accessible.

## How do I fix Opera’s Gmail privacy error?
 
### 1. Set date and time
 
- Click the Start menu, type date and time, then click the Date & time settings app.
 - Toggle off the switch for Set time automatically, then toggle off the switch for Set time zone automatically.
 - Set the Time Zone option to your current physical location using the dropdown menu.
 - Now return to Set time automatically, and Set time zone automatically, and toggle both options on.
 - Launch your Opera or Opera GX browser and verify if the error has disappeared.

 
Incorrect date and time settings might be causing the Gmail privacy error. It’s possible that your Time and Time Zone are deactivated, resulting in the wrong time and date. If this is what triggered the error in your case, this fix should help.
 
This fix is carried out on the PC settings and not the browser but will be helpful for both Opera and Opera GX privacy errors. 
 
### 2. Update your web Browser
 
#### How can I update Opera?
 
- Launch the Opera app.
 - Click on the Opera icon on the top left, then select Update & Recovery.
 - If your version is not updated, you will have an Update button in place of the Check for updates button.
 - Restart the Opera browser.

 
#### How can I update Opera GX?
 
You might be seeing a Gmail privacy error because you’re using an outdated web browser. This is possible because some updates are critical to Gmail running correctly. This might even imply that Opera GX can’t open Gmail. If this is the case, this fix will resolve the issue. 
 
You must have observed that Opera and Opera GX followed the same steps in this solution. This will be true for most processes on these browsers. The main difference is the design or theme of the browsers. 
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

### 3. Clear the cached browser data
 
- Launch your browser.
 - Click on the Opera icon at the top left of your browser and select the Settings option.
 - On the browser’s left pane, select the Advanced option, then select Privacy & security.
 - Click on Clear browser data on the right pane, then from the pop-up windows, select a Time range, select all the checkboxes, and click the Clear data button.
 - Relaunch your browser and check if the Gmail error has been solved.

 
Just like we saw in the second solution, it will be the exact process on the Opera Gmail browser. 
 
If you want to have more control over the type of data you delete, try CCleaner. The app divides your browser data into multiple categories including cookies, cache, download history, last download location, and recently typed URLs. You can select what you want to keep and remove.
 
### 4. Disable third-party browser extensions
 
- Launch the Opera browser.
 - Click on the Menu icon at the top right corner, select the Extensions option, and select Extensions again.
 - At the top of the extensions list, select All, then for every individual extension to be uninstalled, select the Remove button.
 - Once they are all removed, relaunch the browser and see if the error is fixed.

 
A proxy server or other third-party software might obstruct or divert your connection, causing a Gmail privacy error. If this is the case, you should uninstall any newly installed third-party browser plugins or extensions.
 
Once again, if you use the Opera GX gaming browser, the steps will be identical. 
 
### 5. Scan your PC for malware
 
- Click on the Start menu, type windows security, then select the Windows Security app.
 - Click on Virus & threat protection on the left pane, then select Scan options on the right pane.
 - Select Full scan, then select Scan now.
 - After the scan, restart the computer and verify if the error is gone.

 
Malware is not an uncommon reason why you may notice this error. If this is the case for you, a scan should reveal what threats you have, and deleting them should resolve the problem.

### What are the most common privacy errors on Opera? 
 
There are a few other privacy errors you may encounter on browsers, and these are not limited to the Opera browser, but the fixes are often general. They will work on your Opera or Opera GX browsers. 
 
Here are a few privacy errors you encounter on your browsers:
 
- Your connection is not private Chrome error – You will get this error when a pin on your SSL certificate does not match. The error message also exists as Opera GX NET::ERR_SSL_PINNED_KEY_NOT_IN_CERT_CHAIN error.
 - Your connection to this site is not secure – This is triggered when the browser can not validate the security of the site you are visiting. It does not necessarily mean that the site is malicious, but you will have to proceed with caution.
 - This site is not secure – You also receive this error if your browser is unsuccessful at verifying a site’s security. In this case, you should also proceed only if you can trust the website.
 - Err_failed Gmail – A failed error is triggered when a website is down or if the location has been moved.
 - Net::err_cert_date_invalid – If your browser is suspicious about the certificate publisher of the site you are visiting, you may get this error.

 
Typically on your browsers, you would be able to resolve most privacy errors in just a few steps. Before diving into any complicated fixes, we recommend you restart your browser and computer. If that does not fix the errors, you can try any of the fixes suggested in this article. 
 
We hope this guide has been helpful. Remember that most browsers provide an added security option, and it takes just a few clicks to start private browsing sessions in your web browser.
