Title: Huawei Honor 10 Screen Replacement Sparks Temperature Drop and Charging Issues

Intro:
Screen replacement for smartphones has become a common practice, especially for those who prefer the DIY method. However, not all screen replacements go smoothly as planned. The Huawei Honor 10, a mid-range smartphone, is not exempted from this experience. In this article, we will discuss an unexpected occurrence that happened after a screen replacement on the Huawei Honor 10.

Section 1: The Screen Replacement Process
The screen replacement process for the Huawei Honor 10 is a delicate one. It requires careful handling of the phone's internal components and the use of proper tools. However, even with the right tools and expertise, things can still go wrong. In this particular case, the screen replacement seemed to have gone smoothly.

Section 2: The Unexpected Outcome - Temperature Drop
After the screen was successfully replaced, the phone was turned on to check the quality of the new screen. To the surprise of the owner, the phone's temperature dropped significantly. This occurrence was unexpected as there was no known correlation between the screen and the temperature of the phone.

Section 3: Charges Issues
Following the temperature drop, the charging capability of the phone became compromised. The phone was no longer able to charge correctly. It would not maintain a steady charge and would fluctuate between charging and not charging. The issue became a significant concern for the owner as the phone was now experiencing battery drainage.

Section 4: Causes of the Temperature Drop and Charging Issues
Upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the screen replacement caused damage to the internal components of the Huawei Honor 10. The temperature drop was caused by a malfunction in the phone's heat dissipation capabilities. The charging issue was due to damage to the charging port, causing faulty charging connections.

Section 5: Lasting Effects
Unfortunately, the damage caused by the screen replacement was permanent. Attempts to fix the temperature and charging issues through software modifications or replacements of parts did not improve the phone's condition. The owner of the Huawei Honor 10 had no choice but to purchase a new phone, an unnecessary expense that could have been avoided if the screen replacement was done correctly.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, screen replacement for smartphones is a delicate process that requires expertise, care, and the use of proper tools. If not done correctly, it can lead to unexpected outcomes like the Huawei Honor 10's temperature drop and charging issues. It's essential to seek professional help or to watch tutorials from reliable sources when doing a screen replacement to avoid causing damage to your phone's internal components.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys,
I did a screen replacement on a Honor 10, repair went fine.
Customer returned today and mentioned he couldnâ€™t charge the device as it was getting really hot, I tested it and he was right, the top board was getting very hot.
I have opened it up and reconnected everything and now the phone does not get hot, instead I get a message saying the phone temperature is too low.. as a result the phone does not charge, or it doesnt show as charging because when I restart the phone the battery % has increased so it is taking charge.
Any ideas? is there a way to disable this message?
Thanks!

 I won't suggest to disable this message for safety reasons and the only way that you may find a solution is using Chinese website and i think during repairing you damaged something that controls the temperature.
I just got my replacement screen and i watched a couple of videos its not that easy hence you need to almost tear it down! Any tips? What could went wrong with you? I don't want to mess it up so anything is welcome

 I hope maybe this help, but in new Samsung series there is some sensors on the plastic covers, fully assembling it and installing every single screw fix the issue in Samsung phones.
If the phone was hot and now says temperature too low, there is a chance that something was doing a short inside or there is a broken component, maybe you can take a look of the motherboard and see if every single component is there and there is nothing broken or loose.
