Macbook Pro 13 Owners Beware: High Sierra Installation Takes a Shocking 16 Hours!

If you are an owner of a MacBook Pro 13, and you are planning to upgrade your operating system to High Sierra, then you must know about a shocking revelation - the installation process takes an unbelievable 16 hours!

Apple is constantly releasing software updates to improve the performance and security of their operating systems. High Sierra is Apple's latest operating system, and it has several enhancements to offer to Mac users. However, the installation process for High Sierra on Macbook Pro 13 has been causing a lot of frustration and concerns among users.

The installation process of High Sierra requires a large amount of storage space, and this causes the operating system to use the slow-moving hard disk drive (HDD) space to install the new updates. This results in the installation process to take an unusually long time, causing users to lose patience and even abandon the process midway.

In addition to the long installation time, users have also reported that High Sierra is causing their MacBook Pro 13 to freeze or crash. These issues have caused many users to regret updating their operating system to High Sierra and wish they had stuck with their previous operating system.

So, what can you do about this? If you have yet to update your MacBook Pro 13 to High Sierra, it may be best to hold off for a while until Apple sorts out these issues. Alternatively, you can choose to upgrade the HDD of your MacBook Pro 13 to a solid-state drive (SSD), which will result in faster read/write speeds and make the installation process much faster.

It is important to note that upgrading your HDD to an SSD involves some technical know-how, and you may need the help of a professional if you do not have the necessary skills. However, this upgrade is worth it as it will also significantly improve the overall performance of your MacBook Pro 13.

In conclusion, if you are an owner of a MacBook Pro 13 and are planning to update your operating system to High Sierra, then you need to be aware of the potential issues that may arise. The 16 hours installation time can be frustrating, and the potential for your MacBook Pro 13 to crash is a major concern. By holding off on the update or upgrading to an SSD, you can reduce the likelihood of these issues occurring and ensure that your MacBook Pro 13 continues to perform at its best.

## Chosen Solution
 I wanted to install High Sierra on my macbook, but it only took 16 hours for the progress bar to be in the middle. Currently my macbook has no operating system on it. I tried internet recovery, no luck. I installed windows 10 and it took less than 10 minutes to install it and it runs normly, mouse pointer is not laggy at all..
Like everything is so laggy and slow when navigating through High Sierra installer. Yesterday I tried again, I downloaded high sierra from my brothers macbook and it got stuck on the part where I have to choose language, and of mouse pointer was so laggy!! I honestly don’t understand why

 This is a common issue in this series! Most of the time its a bad HD SATA cable. You likely swapped out your HDD for a SSD which is good, but the original HDD was a SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) drive and the SSD you put in is a SATA III (6.0 Gb/s) but the original HD cable was only designed to support the slower drive. Apple also has a few issues with the cable as well so you want to make sure you get the newest version. The 2012 model cable is what you want MacBook Pro 13" Unibody (Mid 2012) Hard Drive Cable and here’s the guide you want to follow MacBook Pro 13" Unibody Early 2011 Hard Drive Cable Replacement
There are a few tricks here you also want to apply. First you want to place a strip of electricians tape on the uppercase where the cable crosses over to help protect it from the rough aluminum surface and you don’t want to crease the cable as that will also damage it! Instead get an old BIC pen and take the ink straw out using it as a form to roll the bends as it has the correct radius for the corner bends.
