# You won't BELIEVE what's missing from the iPad Mini 2 LTE: A game-changing detail revealed!

Are you a tech enthusiast who's eagerly awaiting the launch of the new iPad Mini 2 LTE? Well, you might want to hold your horses because, as it turns out, there's a major detail missing from this highly-anticipated device that could be a game-changer for some users.

So, what's the deal? It seems that the iPad Mini 2 LTE doesn't support GPS functionality. Yes, you read that right â€“ no GPS on a tablet that's designed for on-the-go use. This revelation has left many scratching their heads and wondering how Apple could have possibly overlooked such a crucial feature.

To be fair, the first-generation iPad Mini LTE also lacked GPS capabilities, so this isn't exactly a new issue. However, considering that GPS has become such an integral part of our daily lives, it's surprising that Apple hasn't made it a standard feature on all of their devices.

But what does this mean for the average user? Well, if you're someone who relies on GPS for navigation, fitness tracking, or other location-based services, this could be a deal-breaker. Sure, you could use your smartphone for these purposes, but the whole point of having an iPad with cellular connectivity is to have a larger screen and more processing power.

Of course, there are workarounds for this problem. You could invest in an external GPS receiver that connects to your iPad Mini 2 LTE via Bluetooth, but this would add an extra cost and yet another device to keep track of. Alternatively, you could opt for a different tablet that does have built-in GPS, but if you're a die-hard Apple fan, that might not be an option.

So, what's the bottom line? The iPad Mini 2 LTE is still a powerful and highly-capable device, but the lack of GPS functionality is a glaring omission that could be a deal-breaker for some users. As always, it pays to do your research before making a big purchase, so make sure to weigh the pros and cons of the iPad Mini 2 LTE carefully before pulling the trigger.

## Chosen Solution
 My iPad Mini 2 A1490 has no LCD Shield Plate, were any models produced like this or has it been subject to a botched repair?

 No. If a major part is missing, it has been tampered with.
