Revive Your Cracked Screen iPhone 6S in Two Simple Steps - Learn The Secret To Changing The Battery Yourself!

Are you tired of living with a cracked iPhone 6S screen? Does it bother you that you can’t enjoy the full experience of using your phone? Fear not, because there’s a way to revive it and make it work like new again. With two simple steps and a little bit of guidance, you can change the battery yourself and get your phone back in tip-top shape.

Step 1: Materials Needed

Before you start, make sure you have the following materials:

• New iPhone 6S battery
• Phillips head screwdriver
• Prying tool
• Suction cup tool
• Heat gun or hairdryer

You can easily find these materials online or at your local electronics store. Once you have them all, you’re ready to start the process.

Step 2: Changing the Battery

1. Start by using the plying tool to remove the two screws at the bottom of your iPhone. This will allow you to detach the screen from the rest of the phone.

2. Once you’ve removed the screws, use the suction cup tool to gently lift the screen up. Make sure you don’t apply too much force or you might cause more damage.

3. Use a heat gun or hairdryer to heat the adhesive around the edges of the screen. This will make it easier to remove the screen without damaging it.

4. Using the prying tool, gently lift the screen up and remove it from the phone. Be careful and take your time as there are delicate components attached to the screen.

5. Next, you’ll see the battery attached to the logic board. Use the Phillips head screwdriver to remove the screws holding the battery in place.

6. Detach the battery connector from the logic board by gently lifting it up with the prying tool.

7. Remove the old battery and replace it with the new one.

8. Re-attach the battery connector to the logic board with the prying tool.

9. Replace the screws to secure the new battery in place.

10. Place the screen back onto the phone and press it down to secure it to the adhesive. Replace the two screws at the bottom of the phone.

And that’s it! You’ve successfully changed the battery on your iPhone 6S and revived the phone. You no longer have to suffer through a cracked screen or a dead battery. With a little bit of patience and the right tools, you can easily make this repair on your own.

In conclusion, repairing your iPhone 6S battery doesn’t have to be complicated or costly. You can change the battery yourself by following the steps mentioned above. Just remember to take your time and be careful while handling the delicate components. Good luck with your repair!

## Chosen Solution
 is it dangerous ? or is it possible

 This should be possible although you will have to be careful while removing the screen. The best method I have found is to cover the broken glass with packing tape, place a suction cup on top of that, and then pull upwards. Sometimes the adhesive around the edge of the screen securing it to the phone body will fight back a little bit and if you continue to pull you may further crack the screen. If you can get a gap between the screen and body you can insert an opening pick and work it around the display to release the adhesive. Try not to pry against the display too much as it could cause further cracking.
Once you get the display up it should be business as usual. iFixit does have a full guide on this repair that should help with any other issues you may come up against.
