Title: You Won't Believe What Happened After Changing Crankshaft and Camshaft Sensors in Your Honda Accord!

Subtitle: Everything You Need to Know About Fixing Your Car with the Best Quality Sensors

---

If you own a Honda Accord, chances are you might have faced some issues with your engine. One possible problem can be attributed to your crankshaft and camshaft sensors.

These sensors are responsible for providing information about the position of the engine's pistons, which the car's computer uses to determine the timing of the spark plugs and fuel injectors. When these sensors malfunction, the engine can't function properly, leading to reduced performance or even stalling of the car.

If you've been experiencing issues with your Accord's engine, it might be time to consider replacing your faulty sensors. But before you go, you need to know everything about changing these sensors, selecting the best quality sensors, and how it can make a significant impact on your car's performance.

## The Importance of Crankshaft and Camshaft Sensors

There's no doubt the crankshaft and camshaft sensors are integral components of your car’s engine. These sensors are responsible for ignition timing and fuel injection, and any fault with them can cause engine issues.

Some common signs of a malfunctioning or faulty sensor include reduced fuel efficiency, stalling, rough idling, or a check engine light on your dashboard.

It's always best to address these issues as soon as you notice them because they can lead to further damage if ignored. Replacing your sensors is a quick and straightforward process that can be done within an hour or two, depending on your level of expertise.

## The Process of Replacing the Sensors

To replace the sensors, you don't need any complex tools or equipment. All you'll need is a socket wrench, a torque wrench, and a replacement sensor.

Here are the steps to follow when replacing your sensors:

1.  Locate the malfunctioning sensor. In most Honda Accords, the crankshaft and camshaft sensors are located near the engine's front.

2.  Disconnect the battery. Always ensure to disconnect the car's battery as you work on your car’s electrical system. Unclip the sensors from their sockets, and unscrew the bolts with the socket wrench.

3.  Remove the old sensors. Take off the sensors and ensure to clean the area where the sensors were placed. If your sensors are dirty, this is a great opportunity to clean them up.

4.  Install the new sensors. Place your new sensors in the correct orientation and tighten the bolts with the torque wrench. Reconnect the sensors to their sockets.

5.  Connect the battery. After replacing the sensors, connect the battery and start the engine. Verify if any error codes have been cleared.

With these simple steps, you can replace your Accord's crankshaft and camshaft sensors and get back to enjoying the smooth and reliable performance that you expect from your car.

## Get the Best Quality Sensors for Your Car

When replacing your faulty sensors, always go for the best quality products. High-quality sensors last longer, perform better, and provide accurate data to your car's computer.

Some reliable brands that make quality sensors for your Honda Accord include Bosch, Denso, and NGK. These brands offer durable, reliable, and high-quality sensors that are perfect for your car.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, replacing the crankshaft and camshaft sensors is a simple process that can be done in a few minutes. However, always make sure that you consult a professional mechanic if you're not very familiar with the process.

Selecting the best quality sensors is also crucial in ensuring that your car's engine performs optimally. So, when replacing your sensors, always look out for a reliable and reputable brand.

In the end, by following these steps, you can be sure that you've taken the necessary steps to maintain a healthy and reliable engine in your Honda Accord.

## Chosen Solution
 My car is Honda accord 2011 and it has 55000 miles on it. I got to change the crankshaft sensor as the car stopped in the middle of the road, i got freelancer changed it for me, afterward the engine light didnot went off and the mechanic told me I had to change the camshaft sensor too, But After doing so the engine light still on and make longer crank sound and engine light still on, does both of them need to be relearned or there are any other problem with the wires of the cranshaft or camshaft???

 Most likely, you'll need to either take your own OBDII reader and reset the engine codes or find someone who has one and have them reset the codes to get that light turned off. Chances are, everything is fine, it just hasn't been reset in your cars

 the sensors shouldn’t be going faulty at that mileage, they are telling you something is wrong, probably one of 2 things, if you have replaced the sensors check the wiring for them isn't damaged and get your timing checked, couple of symtoms of bad timing are car randomly stalling, issues trying to start it, those codes may pop up, fuel MPG will go down. get a mechanic to check and give you a diagnosis, they may clear the codes and k you to drive it until they re-appear again. if its timing related don’t leave it to get worse as it may cost you an engine rebuild if something snaps and the valves hit the pistons.
