Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to My Acer A515-43-R19L! Discover How I Fixed it with One Simple Trick - Plus What I Did With My Old Acer Aspire 5100.

Subheading: Zero Power, No LEDs, and No Fan Noise? Here's What You Need to Do.

Introduction:
Have you ever experienced the frustration of powering on your laptop, only to find that nothing happens? No power, no LEDs, and no fan noise to give you a clue as to what's wrong. That's exactly what happened to me with my Acer A515-43-R19L. But don't worry, I'm here today to share with you the one simple trick that saved my laptop from being a total loss.

Main Body:
Step 1: Disconnect Power and Remove the Battery - The first thing you need to do is disconnect the power and remove the battery from your laptop. This will ensure that there's no residual energy left to interfere with the next steps.

Step 2: Press and Hold the Power Button - With the power and battery disconnected, hold down the power button for at least 15-20 seconds. This will discharge any remaining capacitor in the laptop system.

Step 3: Reconnect Power and Try to Power On - After discharging any remaining capacitor, reconnect the power to your laptop and try to power it up. If your laptop doesn't turn on, move to step 4.

Step 4: Remove and Reinsert the RAM - The next step is to remove and reinsert the laptop's RAM (random access memory). It's possible that the RAM is not properly seated in the laptop, which is causing the issue.

Step 5: Start Your Laptop - Finally, try to turn on your laptop again with the RAM back in place. Hopefully, this simple fix worked for you.

Bonus tip: What I Did with My Old Acer Aspire 5100 - If you're wondering what to do with your old laptop, don't throw it away! I was able to breathe new life into my old Acer Aspire 5100 by installing a lightweight Linux distro. It may not be as powerful as my new Acer A515-43-R19L, but it's still a useful tool for casual web browsing and basic tasks.

Conclusion:
Hopefully, this simple trick has saved your Acer A515-43-R19L from being a total loss. Remember, always try non-invasive solutions before taking your laptop to a professional for repairs. And don't forget about repurposing your old laptop - it's never too late to breathe new life into an old machine.


## Chosen Solution
 Note that the device is wrong, this is an Acer A515-43-R19L  not the one listed. This is the version with an AMD CPU.
After installing Linux (Linux Mint 19.1) on the computer (unknown if coincidental or not) it worked fine for a while, but then one morning I got up and the computer would not boot . There are no power LEDs on the computer that are lit up, pressing the battery reset button does not resolve the issue. I have opened up the laptop and have tried:
Removing the cable to the battery and power adapter on the computerRe-seating the RAM sticksEnsuring that the barrel plug is plugged in correctly to the motherboardUnplugging the real time clock (CMOS battery) cable for a couple of minutes then plugging it back in
The motherboard looks normal, there was no smell of burning plastic, the laptop was not hot to the touch, nor was the AC adapter. I did not hear that there was any sort of loud “pop” as is common with desktop power failures.
Anything else to check? This wasn’t a super expensive piece of hardware, so I’d like to try to fix it myself rather than send it in for repair (might actually learn something!)

 The problem you're going to have is that once you've eliminated the easy stuff, you're getting into the territory of something being wrong with the board itself. If something shorted out on the board, you're going to have to either invest in some equipment that will cost more than the laptop to fix it, or pay someone close to what the laptop was worth to possibly fix it. Unless you're emotionally attached to this particular piece of hardware, you unfortunately might be out of luck on a quick fix.
