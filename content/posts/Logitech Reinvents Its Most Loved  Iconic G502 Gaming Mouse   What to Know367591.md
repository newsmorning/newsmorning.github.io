# Game-changer alert: Logitech's iconic G502 gaming mouse just got a major upgrade – Here's everything you need to know!

Logitech is a well-known brand in the gaming community, and their G-series gaming peripherals are highly rated and favored by gamers all over the world. Among the many products in the G-series, one mouse that stood out from the rest was the Logitech G502. Known for its superior performance and excellent design, the G502 has been a favorite among gamers for years. Now, Logitech has released a new version of the G502 with an array of upgrades and improvements that take the already impressive mouse to new heights. Without further ado, let's dive in and take a look at everything that's new in the Logitech G502 HERO.

## Hero Sensor

The Hero sensor is one of the key upgrades in the new G502. This sensor is more responsive than its predecessor, with a 16,000 DPI range and a tracking speed of 400+ IPS. The Hero sensor also boasts improved power efficiency, which means that the G502 will last longer on a single charge.

## 11 Programmable Buttons

Another significant upgrade in the G502 HERO is the number of programmable buttons. The previous model had only six programmable buttons, while the new version has 11. The extra buttons allow gamers to customize their mouse to their preferences and create complex macros that can increase their speed and efficiency in games.

## Updated Design

The G502 HERO has a more refined design; it now features a sleek matte finish and a more polished look. The buttons are also more tactile, which means that they require less force to register a click. This design upgrade makes the G502 HERO more comfortable to use and improves the overall gaming experience.

## Mechanical Switches

The G502 HERO uses mechanical switches for its buttons, which is a significant improvement over the previous version's membrane switches. Mechanical switches are more durable, have a faster response time, and are more satisfying to use than membrane switches. This upgrade ensures that the G502 HERO will remain reliable and functional for years to come.

## Conclusion

The Logitech G502 HERO is an excellent upgrade to an already impressive gaming mouse. The Hero sensor, programmable buttons, updated design, and mechanical switches make the G502 HERO a game-changer in the world of gaming peripherals. It is a testament to Logitech's dedication to improving their products and providing gamers with the best experience possible. If you're a gamer looking for a reliable, high-performance mouse, the Logitech G502 HERO is definitely worth considering.

Logitech has launched a refresh of its most iconic gaming mouse, the G502, with a spate of modern upgrades.

 

There isn’t just one new G502, as the company has prepped three slightly different versions to suit PC gamers' tastes and ever-changing needs. The new line is called G502 X and includes a base wireless version, a standard wired option, and a premium wired version with RGB lighting. 

 

The exterior remains virtually unchanged from previous iterations, but the weight has been drastically reduced to 89 grams, thanks to a thin-wall exoskeleton and a lighter scroll wheel. 

 

The wireless model incorporates the company’s proprietary Lightspeed technology to pump up the response rate by 68 percent compared to the previous gen. This is good news for gamers who hate cables but still want to remain competitive. 

 

All the mice incorporate hybrid optical-mechanical switch technology that combines the tactile feel of mechanical switches with the speedy performance of optical switches. The new G502 X line also takes full advantage of Logitech’s Hero 25K gaming sensor, the company’s most advanced mouse sensor. 

 

They also have a removable DPI shift button for advanced customization, with options to switch the orientation and make speed adjustments. 

 

The G502 X line is available for preorder now via the Logitech G website, though they will also be sold at both online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores in the coming days. These accessories are available in black and white and will set you back $80 to $160, depending on your configuration.
