Revive Your FiiO E10K DAC with This Easy Soldering Technique for a Stable Micro USB Port!

Are you tired of dealing with the frustration of a loose micro USB port on your FiiO E10K DAC? Don't throw it away just yet! With a few simple tools and some soldering skills, you can revive your FiiO E10K DAC and get a stable micro USB port.

The FiiO E10K DAC is a popular digital-to-analog converter that offers great sound quality for its size and price. However, many users have reported issues with the micro USB port, which can become loose over time and cause connection problems. This issue can be frustrating, but it's not a death sentence for your device.

To get started, you'll need a few things:

1. Soldering iron
2. Solder
3. Desoldering wick/braid or a desoldering pump
4. A replacement micro USB port

Once you have these items, you can begin the process of fixing your FiiO E10K DAC.

Step 1: Disassemble your device

To start, you need to open your FiiO E10K DAC to get access to the inside. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws from the bottom of the device, and then gently pry open the casing. Be careful not to damage any internal components while doing this.

Step 2: Remove the old micro USB port

Once you have access to the inside of the device, you need to remove the old micro USB port. This can be done using a desoldering pump or desoldering wick/braid. Heat up each pin of the old port with your soldering iron and remove the solder. Once all pins have been desoldered, the old port can be removed.

Step 3: Install the new micro USB port

Now that you've removed the old port, you need to install the replacement micro USB port. Position the new port in place and apply a small amount of solder to each pin. Make sure the port is secure in its position.

Step 4: Reassemble your device

After completing the soldering process, reassemble your FiiO E10K DAC. Put the casing back in place and replace the screws removed in step one.

Congratulations! You have successfully fixed your FiiO E10K DAC's micro USB port. You can now enjoy high-quality audio without any connection issues.

In conclusion, a loose micro USB port on your FiiO E10K DAC is not the end of the world. With some simple tools and soldering skills, you can fix the problem and enjoy your DAC once again. Just be sure to take your time and be careful not to damage any internal components.


## Chosen Solution
 I'd like a longer title but it doesn't appear to be allowed.
So i'm looking to repair my USB DAC because it does not receive power unless the USB port is pushed in a certain direction. So I'm thinking that the solder points have broken.
I have taken it apart, however looking at the back and wobbling the connection I don't see any movement, so I *think* that the solder between the port and the connection point is whats broken, but due to other things on the PCB I can't get a good look (and it doesn't wobble much, theres 2 connections holding it in place so the other must still be good, probably wobbles maybe 0.5mm either way, but apparently thats enough to cause a disconnect from the pins). It could also be a pad, i'm not 100% sure.
So keeping in mind that I'm a complete begginer, and my limited supplies (I haven't ever soldered anything before, I only have a soldering station and some solder, no flux or any other equipment) what should I try? Should I just stick a soldering iron on the presumably broken joint and get it to hopefully re-solidify in the right way for it to fix my USB port and maintain contact with the pins? I have a small budget for this, $50 AUD if I need to get more supplies, any more then that and i'd rather just get a new DAC as it was just a bit over 100 AUD.

 @sol33t303 if you have never done this before, I suggest you get a couple of old practice boards first. It is not a terribly complicated repair but does require some practice. You do not want to damage the board or rip the traces because of a too cold or even a too hot iron. Even so YouTube can't teach you to solder, but there is at least enough information that may help you to get started on a successful repair. Even guides like this How To Solder and Desolder Connections - iFixit Repair Guide can be helpful. Practice, practice, practice will have the largest impact on a good repair.
Post some pictures of the loose connector etc. with your QUESTION. That way we can see what you see and maybe give you some pointers. Adding images to an existing question - iFixit Repair Guide

 you could maybe get it repaired for that price by someone with experience and the other tools, but if you want to try it yourself at least get flux, kingbo will do fine but do not use plumbers flux as its corrosive
