Title: This One Weird Trick Fixes Lost Ark's Infuriating Server Connection Error - Find Out Now!

Are you tired of experiencing Lost Ark's infuriating server connection error? Are you losing out on precious time and data due to connection drops? If you're a fan of this massively multiplayer online role-playing game, then you might know the frustration of getting kicked out of game sessions and facing the error message: "lost connection to server." However, there is hope – we have discovered one weird trick that fixes this issue. Find out now and say goodbye to connection errors forever.

The problem with Lost Ark's server connection error is that players often assume it's a server issue or a problem that's beyond their control, but this is not necessarily true. In most cases, the problem lies in the internet or Wi-Fi connection. The good news, however, is that there is a simple solution to this problem: change your DNS settings.

DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it's responsible for translating website names into numerical IP addresses. When your device requests to access a website or server, it sends a DNS query to your internet service provider (ISP) to get the IP address for the website. If the ISP's DNS servers are busy, slow or overloaded, then it can cause connection errors.

To fix the server connection error in Lost Ark, you need to change your DNS settings to use a different DNS server. The best DNS server to use is Google's public DNS server. Here is how to change your DNS settings on Windows:

Step 1. Go to Control Panel or open the Start menu and search for 'Network and Sharing Center.'

Step 2. Click on 'Change adapter settings.'

Step 3. Right-click on the connection you're using and click 'Properties.'

Step 4. Click on 'Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)' and then click 'Properties.'

Step 5. Select 'Use the following DNS server addresses' and enter 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in the preferred and alternate DNS server fields.

Step 6. Click 'OK' and close all windows.

Once you've changed your DNS settings, try reconnecting to Lost Ark, and the server connection error should be resolved.

Conclusion:

The server connection error in Lost Ark can be an annoying issue, but it's not an unsolvable problem. Changing your DNS settings to Google's public DNS server can fix the issue and improve your internet connection's stability. Follow the simple steps above and say goodbye to connection errors forever. Happy gaming!
