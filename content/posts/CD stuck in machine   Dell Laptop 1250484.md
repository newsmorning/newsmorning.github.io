Have you ever found yourself stumbling upon a long-lost mixtape with your favorite tunes from back in the day? You know, the kind that takes you back to a different era and makes you feel all nostalgic? Well, imagine finding an epic mixtape from over a decade ago hiding in your old Dell laptop. That's exactly what one man recently discovered, and it's a story that will leave you utterly amazed.

It all started when John [Surname] decided to clean up his old room and stumbled upon his trusty old Dell laptop from nearly a decade ago. A laptop that he thought was long gone and forgotten. The computer had been stored in a corner of his closet, collecting dust and cobwebs. But John knew that the laptop held something special – something that he had been trying to retrieve for the past few years.

You see, John was a huge fan of 90s music, and he had spent countless hours creating the ultimate mixtape – a compilation CD that featured all of his favorite tracks from the era. It was a masterpiece, and John was proud of it. However, disaster struck when his laptop crashed, and he lost all of his files, including the music that he had painstakingly compiled. But John was not one to give up so easily. He tried everything in his power to retrieve the mixtape, but it seemed like all of his efforts were in vain.

That is until he stumbled upon the laptop by chance, and something magical happened. John powered on the computer and, to his surprise, discovered that the mixtape was still intact! He couldn't believe what he was seeing, but he quickly realized that the laptop had somehow managed to preserve the files despite the crash. It was a miracle, and John was ecstatic to retrieve his prized possession.

But that's not all. As John delved deeper into the files on the laptop, he came across something that left him in utter shock. It turns out that the laptop had been used by his sister before he had owned it, and she had been using it to write a book. John had no idea that his sister was an aspiring author, and he was completely blown away by what he found on the laptop – a completed manuscript of a book that she had been working on!

John couldn't believe his eyes as he read through page after page of the manuscript. It was a beautifully written story that took him on an emotional journey. After reading the manuscript, John reached out to his sister and told her what he had discovered. She was thrilled to hear that her work had not gone to waste, and she encouraged him to publish the book on her behalf.

And so, John decided to take the plunge and publish his sister's book, titled "Hidden Wonders." It was a success, and the book became a hit among readers. John never thought that his desperate attempts to retrieve his epic mixtape would lead him to such a jaw-dropping discovery. It just goes to show that sometimes, the things we are searching for are right under our noses, and we just need to look a little closer to find them.

In conclusion, John's story is a testament to the power of perseverance and the unexpected surprises that life can bring. So, if you have an old laptop lying around that you thought was of no use, you might want to take a closer look. Who knows, you might just stumble upon your own hidden wonders!

## Chosen Solution
 Dell model no pp39L CD has got stuck in machine and won't eject, now machine will not turn off keeps saying it's logging off but does nothing, can only turn it of at the start button. Any ideas?

 Is the CD drive the kind that you just push insert a cd or is it the kind where you press a button and the tray comes out for you to place the CD into?
