Title: The Shocking Truth about What to Do With Your Old Gear in Lost Ark

Are you tired of the clutter in your inventory in Lost Ark? Have you been hoarding old gear in hopes of using it someday? Well, experts have revealed the shocking truth about what you should do with your old gear.

Firstly, it is important to understand the value of your old gear. While it may seem insignificant and useless, it can actually be a valuable asset in the game. These items, particularly those of purple and orange rarity, can be disassembled to produce useful materials such as crystal shards and enchantment dust. These materials can be used to upgrade your current gear or even craft new items.

So, what should you do with your old gear? The answer is simple: disassemble them! This not only frees up space in your inventory but also provides valuable resources that can be used to improve your character's gear.

But wait, there's more! Some items can also be recycled, providing even more benefits. You can recycle costumes, mounts, and pets to receive costume scraps, mount feed, and pet food respectively. These items can then be used to upgrade your existing mounts, pets, and costumes. The higher the rarity of the item, the better the reward for recycling it.

It is also worth noting that some items, particularly those with unique effects, should not be disassembled or recycled. These items can be traded or sold to other players for a hefty sum of gold.

In conclusion, there is no need to cling onto your old gear in Lost Ark. Disassemble them to produce valuable resources that can be used to upgrade your current gear or even craft new items. Recycling certain items can also provide additional benefits. By following these expert tips, you can effectively manage your inventory and improve your character's equipment.

Similar to other MMORPGs, inventories in Lost Ark can be jam-packed with a range of items from chests to gears. Now you can either stockpile these items or replace them with high-tier items. We suggest you do the latter as you proceed in the game. There are two options for better inventory management. You can either sell or dismantle your gear to clear your inventory in Lost Ark. But what should you do – sell or dismantle?
 
## Should You Dismantle or Sell Gear in Lost Ark?
 
Before we get on to the decision, let’s understand how does dismantling and selling old gear works in this game.

### What is Dismantling Gear?
 
- As the name already suggests, dismantling is disassembling different pieces in items. You can keep these different items or craft them to make a new product.
 - But before dismantling items, you will have to unlock the function to dismantle.
 - If you have just begun with Lost Ark, you need to complete a quest for Archeologist Hadim to unlock dismantling items.
 - Once you have unlocked it, you can choose to either dismantle a single item or dismantle different items that fit in the same category.

 
- You will receive powder and other pieces of the gear after you have dismantled an item.
 - You can choose to keep these resources or sell them for gold coins.
 - To know how to dismantle any item, you can check our guide on how to dismantle items to know more.

 
### How does Selling Gear Work?
 
- One of the best ways to earn gold, which is a rarer currency of Lost Ark is to sell your items. And it is downright simple.
 - You just have to go to the shop and choose the sell option to sell your gear.
 - It can help you in freeing your stock-piled inventory and earn some gold coins in return.

 
## Lost Ark – Dismantle or Sell Gear?
 
Now the choice to dismantle or sell is totally up to you. But in my opinion, dismantling old gear is a smarter and more efficient way. As you dismantle an item or gear, you get different pieces of that gear or items. These different pieces of gear can help you earn more gold coins than selling a single old gear to vendors. Although selling is a simpler method to earn gold, taking a tiny effort to dismantle old gear can help you earn extra gold coins.
