# Discover the Ultimate Network Connection Hacks: 8 Simple Steps to Troubleshoot Like a Pro!

We take the convenience of network connections for granted, but when they stop working, the frustration of not being able to access the internet or connect to other devices can be overwhelming. These connection problems can happen on any device, from a smartphone to a laptop, and they can be caused by a variety of factors. In this article, we will discuss 8 simple steps you can take to troubleshoot network connection issues like a pro.

## Step 1: Check the Basics

The first step in troubleshooting network connection issues is to check the basics. Make sure that your device is connected to the right network, has the correct login credentials, and is within range of the router. Also, check to see if other devices on the same network are experiencing similar problems.

## Step 2: Restart the Devices

Sometimes, the issue is as simple as restarting your device. Turn off your device completely, and then start it up again. Doing so can reset the network settings and fix any bugs or glitches.

## Step 3: Restart the Router

If restarting your device does not work, try restarting the router. Turn off the router by unplugging it, wait for 30 seconds, and then plug it back in again. This action can reset the router’s network settings and help with connection issues.

## Step 4: Check the DNS Server

DNS (Domain Name System) servers are responsible for converting domain names into IP addresses. If your device is not able to connect to the internet, the DNS server may be down or overloaded. To fix this, try using a different DNS server. Some popular options include Google DNS, OpenDNS, and Cloudflare.

## Step 5: Check for Software Updates

Outdated software can cause network connection problems. Check for any available software updates from your device’s manufacturer or network provider. Updating your software can fix bugs and improve network connectivity.

## Step 6: Reset Network Settings

If the above steps do not work, resetting your device's network settings may solve the problem. This action will erase all current network settings, such as Wi-Fi passwords and Bluetooth connections. However, it can be a quick fix for network connection issues.

## Step 7: Check Firewall and Antivirus Settings

Firewalls and antivirus software can sometimes interfere with network connections. Check your device’s firewall and antivirus settings to see if there are any network restrictions in place.

## Step 8: Contact Technical Support

If you have tried all the above steps and are still experiencing network connection issues, it may be time to contact technical support. Your device’s manufacturer or network provider may be able to provide additional troubleshooting and support.

In conclusion, network connection issues can be frustrating, but with these 8 simple steps, you can troubleshoot like a pro. Start with the basics, restart your devices and router, check the DNS server, update your software, reset your network settings, check firewall and antivirus settings, and lastly, contact technical support if needed. With these tips, you can enjoy a seamless network connection and avoid future connectivity issues.

A faulty Wi-Fi
connection doesn’t have to ruin your day. There are plenty of ways you can
restore a lost internet connection. Follow these network troubleshooting tips
and you’ll be up and running in no time. 
 
## 1. Check Your Settings
 
First, check your
Wi-Fi settings. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi. Switch Wi-Fi to the On
position.
 
Phones and
tablets also have settings that turn Wi-Fi on and off. Make sure that it is
turned on so you can connect to the network.
 

 
You also want to
check if Airplane Mode is turned on.
 
## 2. Check Your Access Points
 
Check your WAN
(wide area network) and LAN (local area network) connections. In layman’s
terms, these are the Ethernet cables that go to and from your router. 
 
If you suspect
that the cables are the culprit, try swapping them out with new ones. 
 
## 3. Go Around Obstacles
 
Walls, furniture,
and other obstructions can be the reason why you’re unable to go online. Moving
closer to the router can re-establish the connection. If moving closer to the
router does not solve the issue, then at least we can remove it from the list
of suspects.
 
## 4. Restart the Router
 
Sometimes
restarting the router can help fix connectivity issues. This is even truer in
cases where the router has not been turned off in a while. A quick restart can
jolt the router back into working like it used to.
 
If that doesn’t
work, you might also consider resetting the router. But only do so if you’re
okay with it being restored to its factory settings. You will have to
reconfigure everything including the SSID and password.
 
## 5. Check the Wi-Fi Name and Password
 
Check the network
name (otherwise known as SSID) and password of the network connection. If
you’re used to connecting automatically when in range of a router but are no
longer able to, changes may have been made to the network while you’re away.
 
It could be as
simple as administrators updating the password or the SSID could have been
changed to a different one.
 
## 6. Check DHCP Settings
 
Routers are
usually set up as DHCP servers. This setting lets computers join a network
automatically. With DHCP turned on, users will no longer have to mess with IP
Address and DNS Server settings manually.
 
To edit your DHCP
settings, go to Windows Settings
> Network & Internet > Wi-Fi. Under Wi-Fi, click Manage Known
Networks. Select a network and click Properties.
 
Under IP Settings, click Edit. From the drop-down menu, select Automatic (DHCP). 
 
Note: Selecting Manual will let
you set your DNS Server Address and IP Address settings manually.
 
## 7.
Update Windows
 
Your network
problems could be caused by your system. If that is the case, Windows could
have possibly released a fix. Try updating your Windows machine to the latest
release.
 
Go to Windows Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. Click Check for Updates. If there are updates
available, Windows will download and install them.
 
## 8.
Open Windows Network Diagnostics
 
Windows has a
tool called Windows Network Diagnostics that lets users troubleshoot connection
issues. 
 
Go to Windows Settings > Network & Internet > Status. Under Change Your Network Settings, click Network Troubleshooter.
 
Windows Network
Diagnostics will run a couple of tests to see what’s possibly causing your
Wi-Fi issues.
 
Windows will let
you know if it does not find any issue. Otherwise, you will be given a list of
possible actions to take to resolve the problem.
 
This tool, or a
version of it, should be available in Windows 7 to Windows 10.
