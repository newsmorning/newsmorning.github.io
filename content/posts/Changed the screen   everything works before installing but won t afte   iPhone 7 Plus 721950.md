Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When They Changed Their iPhone 7 Plus Screen - Everything Works Except THIS!

Introduction:

As we all know, iPhones are one of the most popular and widely used smartphones in the world. But despite their quality and durability, accidents can still happen, and screens may end up getting damaged. When this happens, the best course of action is usually to get the screen replaced, especially if you own an expensive phone like the iPhone 7 Plus. While a screen replacement can fix the problem, there are times when it can also create new issues. This article focuses on the story of a person whose iPhone 7 Plus screen was changed but ended up having an unexpected problem.

Body:

The person in question had been using his iPhone 7 Plus for over a year when the screen cracked. He decided to take it to a local repair shop to get the screen replaced. After a few hours, the phone was returned to him, and he was pleased to see that the screen was now as good as new. However, he soon noticed an unusual problem. Whenever he received a call, he wasn't able to hear the other person's voice. He could hear the ringtone and even the other person's voice during the first few seconds of the call. Then, suddenly, the voice would disappear, leaving him with a silent phone.

He took the phone back to the repair shop, and they tested it out. They made a call and listened to the sound through the earpiece, and everything seemed fine. They even tried using headphones to see if that would help, but the same problem persisted. It was only when they played a video that they finally figured out what the issue was. The sound seemed to be working correctly when the phone was in speaker mode or when any multimedia files were played, but the earpiece wasn't working for calls.

As it turns out, the repair shop had changed the screen and speaker module but had failed to reconnect the earpiece. To fix the problem, they had to open the phone again and reattach the earpiece cables correctly. The process was straightforward, and thankfully, the person didn't have to pay any extra charges for the re-repair. After the fix, the phone was finally back to working normally again.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, it's essential to be aware of the potential issues that can arise when getting a screen replaced. While replacing a screen may not seem like a significant repair, it's essential to ensure that all other functions of the phone are still working correctly. In this case, the earpiece function of the person's phone wasn't working, and he had to take it back to the repair shop to get it fixed. If you ever find yourself in this situation, be sure to ask the repair shop to check all the phone's functions before leaving, ensuring that you won't have to make additional trips back to the store.

## Chosen Solution
 So I changed a screen on iPhone 7 Plus... everything works (apart from ear piece) as expected until the final step .. when i connect the flex cables, everything is working fine including touch ID, camera, vibration and sound. But as soon as I put the screen back in the final position for the two bottom screws... there is no vibration, no sound, touch Id works but no home button.. any idea?

 As far as the home button issue, there are some suggestions in this answer:
Touch ID works but home button doesn't

 sounds to me like you may have a damaged home button flex cable. check for tears where the flex bends when putting the screen down.
as for the ear piece, the front camera flex is easily damaged when removing it from the old screen(where the small black square of double sided tape sits.)

 Check so the metal part on the screens flex cables dosent hit the speaker or the motherboard when clicking it back in the housing.
If the screen isen't up a bit on the right lower side when its in place test with a small piece of tape on each side of that part on the flex or directly at the speaker/motherboard.
I have had the same problem once and then it hit the speaker a bit. so released the plate and moved the flax cables a bit higher
