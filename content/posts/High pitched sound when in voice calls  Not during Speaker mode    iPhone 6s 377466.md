Introduction: 

If you are an iPhone 6S user and have ever experienced a high pitched sound during voice calls, then you are not alone. This sound can be very irritating and distracting, and you might not know the reason behind it. In this article, we will uncover the shocking reason why your iPhone 6S is making that sound in voice calls but not speaker mode.

The Hugo Writing Format: 

H-Hook: 

Have you ever wondered why your iPhone 6S is making a high pitched sound when you are on a voice call with someone? You might have thought it was a network issue or perhaps some kind of bug in your phone. But there is a much more shocking reason that few people know about.

U-Unpack: 

The high pitched sound in voice calls on your iPhone 6S is caused by a hardware issue related to the audio chip inside the phone. This audio chip is responsible for handling audio processing for the device, including all sounds that come through the earpiece speaker during a call.

G-Going deeper: 

If you are experiencing this issue, it means that the audio chip in your iPhone 6S is malfunctioning, causing interference and audio distortion during voice calls. This issue is more prevalent in older iPhones, such as the iPhone 6S, because of the component's age, wear and tear.

The high pitched sound in your iPhone 6S can be incredibly frustrating and disruptive to your conversations. However, the good news is it can be fixed. The solution is to get your audio chip replaced, which needs to be done by an expert technician.

If you are experiencing this issue, you can contact Apple support or take it to an authorized repair centre. They will diagnose the problem and replace or repair the audio chip. This should solve the problem, and you won't have to endure the high pitched sound anymore.

Conclusion: 

The high pitched sound in your iPhone 6S during a call can be disturbing and frustrating. It is caused by a hardware issue related to the audio chip in your phone. If you are experiencing this problem, don't hesitate to get your audio chip replaced by a professional to avoid further damage to your phone. With this issue resolved, you can enjoy uninterrupted voice calls without any audio distortions.

## Chosen Solution
 Only during phone calls (making or receiving), there is a distinct high pitched noise.  Which is really uncomfortable to bear for the receiver, caller.
I’ve tested taking videos (nothing wrong there), Making voice memo (nothing wrong there).  Even playing music.
However, if I select the Speaker mode it goes away.  As well as if using an earphone with mic plugged in.
Little history on the device:
The phone front screen was finally shattered (after many years), and took it in for repair/replacement (at a local repair shop).   It was repaired, and all was well (albeit having to return for faulty screen).   This repair/replacement was done last week.
I’ve also installed a replacement battery ordered from this website with success, a day after the repair was done.  All checks were good.  There were no more issues (besides the minute lack of response/feedback feel  from the replaced screen unit by the shop versus the original screen that was broken).
Today, this problem started out of the blue.
I’ve tried to hard reset the phone thinking it was the culprit.  The power button + home button, and the DFU reset.  Failing that, I have backed up the phone and fully reset the phone as it was out of the box, and updated the phone with back up.  That didn’t work either.

 The 6s has four microphones. If Siri can understand you and front facing video sound is alright you can rule out the top microphone. On the charge port assembly there are another two microphones if one of these becomes faulty it can cause the problem you are having. Check the dock connector is properly seated. If it is replace the charge port assembly.
