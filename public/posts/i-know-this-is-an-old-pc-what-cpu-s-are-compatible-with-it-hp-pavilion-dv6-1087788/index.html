Introduction Technology changes quickly, and it’s easy to feel as though your trusty old computer is falling behind the times. Fortunately, it’s possible to upgrade an old machine rather than replacing it entirely. This is especially true of HP Pavilion DV6 laptops, which can enjoy significant performance improvements with relatively simple upgrades.\nWhat CPU Options Are Available? To improve the performance of your HP Pavilion DV6, you may want to upgrade your CPU (Central Processing Unit). There are several options available to you, each with different specifications and levels of performance. Here are three CPU options to consider:\ni7-2630QM This Intel CPU features four cores, eight threads, and a base clock speed of 2.0 GHz, with a Turbo Boost of up to 2.9 GHz. It’s an excellent option for multitasking and demanding applications such as video editing or gaming. The i7-2630QM can handle up to 16 GB of RAM and has a TDP (Thermal Design Power) rating of 45 watts.\ni7-2760QM The i7-2760QM is another Intel CPU with four cores and eight threads, but it boasts a base clock speed of 2.4 GHz, with a Turbo Boost of up to 3.5 GHz. This CPU is even better suited for demanding applications than the i7-2630QM, but it’s also more power hungry, with a TDP rating of 45 watts.\ni7-2820QM Finally, the i7-2820QM is another Intel CPU with four cores and eight threads, but it has a base clock speed of 2.3 GHz, with a Turbo Boost of up to 3.4 GHz. It’s also capable of handling up to 16 GB of RAM, but its TDP rating is slightly higher at 55 watts.\nHow to Install Your New CPU Once you’ve selected your CPU, it’s time to install it. Here’s how to do it:\nFirst, make sure you have the necessary tools, including a screwdriver, thermal compound, and rubbing alcohol.\nShut down your laptop and remove the battery.\nLocate the CPU compartment on the bottom of the laptop.\nRemove the screws holding the CPU cover in place and carefully remove the cover.\nUnlock the CPU socket using the lever or latch mechanism.\nCarefully remove the existing CPU by lifting it straight up and out of the socket.\nApply a small amount of thermal compound to the top of your new CPU.\nCarefully insert the new CPU by aligning the notches with those in the socket and lowering it in place.\nLock the CPU in place using the lever or latch mechanism.\nReattach the CPU cover and screws and replace the battery.\nConclusion Upgrading a laptop’s CPU can be a fantastic way to boost its overall performance, and the HP Pavilion DV6 is no exception. By selecting the right CPU and following the installation instructions carefully, you can enjoy a significantly faster and more capable machine.\nChosen Solution I got a pavilion dv6 from my gma (free) and want this thing to be as fast as possible. It currently has a mobile amd turion II. Is there anything faster than this thats compatible with it?\nWe would need to know exactly what DV6 yours is. There are a few different variants (with UMA memory and those with discrete memory for the graphics system) . Some variants are using soldered processors and thus you can’t replace it. Even if it is possible to upgrade the processor it will still not turn into a speed demon. I suggest that the best upgrade you can do is to install a solid state drive. Also, max out the RAM (upgrade to 8 gigs). Either upgrade will be helpful and will be a marked improvement. Download the service manual for your laptop from here It’ll tell you all you need to know about your computer. Update (09/11/2020) Dylan Devries if you want to go and try some processor just keep in mind that your computer socket is S1g4. here is a list of compatible processors. If you really want to try something decent a Phenom II Black Edition Quad-Core would work in the same socket. Your motherboard will support it but we do not know if your BIOS does. That can become a major issue since we do not know which ones are BIOS supported. Since you are going for a custom case etc you must pay particular good attention to the cooling requirements. The greater the processing power the more heat is generated. Again, I’d go max RAM and SSD first :-)\nThe problem with CPU upgrades is not that it can’t be done if the CPU is socketed - the problem is time investment vs. performance gain unless you’re going from a low end entry level CPU to a solid midrange or high end one (Ex: Pentium B950\u003ei5-2450M/Turion II P560\u003ePhenom II N970). There are multiple problems I see on the value side: For Intel systems, the gains are better but you have to be coming from something very low end like a B950 to a 2450M to make this project worthwhile ($15-20 for a used 2450M). You run into similar issues when you move up the i3 on the Intel side as you do with AMD (+864 points with the i3-2350M\u003ei5-2450M). I would only do an i3\u003ei5 swap if I had a compatible CPU and it cost me nothing personally with such close margins. Sub 1,000+ gains aren’t worth the effort required.On the AMD side, the margins are low even when I assume the system shipped with a Turion II P560. You’d need to max this out with the N970 for it to be worthwhile with AMD boards - and you only gain +829 CPU points. That’s a rounding error for the time required to get it.Some CPUs cost about as much as a upgraded computer on the secondary market, without Covid-19 affecting availability.This is HP specific, but they also tend to have problems cooling higher end CPUs well (less without the GPU, though). Stick to midrange options like the i5 or the temps often skyrocket.Soldered CPUs really took off with Broadwell on Intel and later AMD A Series APUs once they retired the Turion and Phenom series, so you’re not affected until you step up to a system from 2013 on the Intel side - timing on AMD is similar. Yes it can be done since this is just old enough to be safe from the soldered CPU issues we’ve seen since Broadwell on the Intel side (similar timing for AMD), but unless you’re dealing with a low end CPU now and get a good deal on a used Core i5 or AMD equivalent, it’s usually not worth bothering due to the cost to do the swap and the time required. This is not something you can do quickly unless you’ve done it; and if you know how you can tell when it’s a complete waste of time.\n","wordCount":"1152","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Berry Amerson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/i-know-this-is-an-old-pc-what-cpu-s-are-compatible-with-it-hp-pavilion-dv6-1087788/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Discover the Hidden CPU Gems Compatible with Your Old HP Pavilion DV6 - Upgrade Your PC Like a Pro!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 19, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1152 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Berry Amerson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#what-cpu-options-are-available>What CPU Options Are Available?</a><ul><li><a href=#i7-2630qm>i7-2630QM</a></li><li><a href=#i7-2760qm>i7-2760QM</a></li><li><a href=#i7-2820qm>i7-2820QM</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#how-to-install-your-new-cpu>How to Install Your New CPU</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=discover-the-hidden-cpu-gems-compatible-with-your-old-hp-pavilion-dv6---upgrade-your-pc-like-a-pro>Discover the Hidden CPU Gems Compatible with Your Old HP Pavilion DV6 - Upgrade Your PC Like a Pro!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#discover-the-hidden-cpu-gems-compatible-with-your-old-hp-pavilion-dv6---upgrade-your-pc-like-a-pro>#</a></h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>Technology changes quickly, and it&rsquo;s easy to feel as though your trusty old computer is falling behind the times.
