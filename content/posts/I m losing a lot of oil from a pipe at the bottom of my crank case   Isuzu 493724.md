If you are an Isuzu owner, you should be concerned about the video that has gone viral on social media. The video shows an Isuzu's crank case pipe spewing oil like a fountain, leaving a trail of oil on the road.

This shocking incident has left many Isuzu owners worried about the safety and reliability of their vehicles. It raises a crucial question, "IS YOUR ISUZU BLEEDING OUT?".

To answer this question, we must first understand what a crank case pipe is and what it does. The crank case pipe is a small metal tube that connects the crankcase to the air intake system. Its primary function is to allow any built-up pressure or gas in the crankcase to escape and flow into the engine's air intake system, where it gets burnt away.

Now, let's discuss the reasons behind the Isuzu's crank case pipe spewing oil. The most common cause of this problem is a clogged crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system's job is to remove any moisture or contaminants from the crankcase and expel them out of the engine.

When the crankcase ventilation system gets clogged, the crankcase pressure builds up, forcing oil out of the crank case pipe. This pressure buildup can also cause oil leaks and blowouts, which can result in severe engine damage.

To prevent your Isuzu from suffering the same fate, you must maintain your vehicle regularly. Regular maintenance ensures that your Isuzu's crank case pipe and ventilation system remain clean and functional. Here's what you can do:

1. Check your Isuzu's oil level regularly: Make sure your Isuzu has the right amount of oil in the crankcase. Low oil levels can cause pressure buildup, leading to oil leaks and blowouts.

2. Change your Isuzu's oil and oil filter regularly: This task is the most crucial part of maintaining your Isuzu. Old oil and filters can clog the crankcase ventilation system, causing pressure buildup.

3. Replace your Isuzu's crank case pipe regularly: The crank case pipe can get clogged or damaged over time. Replacing it regularly can prevent oil leaks and blowouts.

4. Have your Isuzu inspected by a certified mechanic: Regular inspections can detect any issues before they become a problem.

In conclusion, the video of the Isuzu's crank case pipe spewing oil serves as a warning to all Isuzu owners. Regular maintenance is vital to keeping your Isuzu running smoothly and preventing serious engine damage. So, IS YOUR ISUZU BLEEDING OUT? If you have neglected your Isuzu's maintenance, it most likely is. Don't wait until it's too late. Take action today to prevent a similar incident from happening to your Isuzu.

 Hi,
Here’s the service manual for an Isuzu C22NE engine. It dates around the time that you mentioned and it is a 4 cylinder engine, although it is only a 2.2L.
Perhaps this will be of no help but you never know.
