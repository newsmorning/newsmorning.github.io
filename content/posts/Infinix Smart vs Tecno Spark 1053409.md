# Ultimate smartphone showdown: Infinix Smart Vs Tecno Spark - which one will reign supreme?

When it comes to budget smartphones, Infinix and Tecno have been dominating the market with their quality products that offer a wide range of features at an affordable price. Recently, both companies have released their latest budget smartphones in the market, the Infinix Smart and the Tecno Spark. These two phones are quite similar in terms of features and price, but which one will reign supreme? In this ultimate smartphone showdown, we will compare the Infinix Smart and Tecno Spark to determine which one is the ultimate winner.

## Design and Display

In terms of design, both phones are quite similar. The Infinix Smart and Tecno Spark both have a sleek and slim design that feels comfortable in the hand. Both phones are available in different color options, which gives users the freedom to choose their favorite. However, there is a slight difference in terms of display, where Infinix Smart has a 6.6-inch HD+ waterdrop display, while Tecno Spark has a 6.52-inch HD+ display. Infinix Smart takes the lead with a larger display, giving users a better viewing experience.

## Camera

When it comes to the camera, both phones are equipped with a triple-camera setup at the back. However, the Infinix Smart has a 13MP main camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a QVGA sensor, while Tecno Spark has a 13MP main camera, a 2MP macro camera, and an AI sensor. Infinix Smart is the clear winner here, as its QVGA sensor offers better low-light photography, which is a significant feature in a budget smartphone.

## Performance and Battery

Both phones use the same processor, which is MediaTek Helio A22, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. However, Infinix Smart has an advantage in terms of battery, as it has a massive 5000mAh battery compared to Tecno Spark's 5000mAh battery. The Infinix Smart can last up to two days of normal usage, which is quite impressive for a budget smartphone. 

## Software and OS

Both phones run on Android 10, with Infinix Smart using XOS 6.2, while Tecno Spark uses HiOS 6.2. Infinix Smart has a simpler and cleaner interface, which is easier to use compared to Tecno Spark, which has a lot of pre-installed apps that can make the phone feel cluttered. 

## Price

Finally, the price is always the determining factor for budget smartphones. Infinix Smart is available at KES 9,999, while Tecno Spark is available at KES 10,499. In terms of price, Infinix Smart offers better features at a lower price, making it the better buy.

## Which one reigns supreme?

Overall, both phones are excellent budget smartphones that offer a lot of value for their price. However, the Infinix Smart stands out in several areas, such as better camera performance, longer battery life, and a lower price point. Therefore, Infinix Smart is the outright winner of this ultimate smartphone showdown.

It’s the battle of underdogs. The Infinix Smart and Tecno Spark are the new super budget offings from their respective companies. They don very similar specs and are very competitively priced, but how do they stack up against each other, let’s find out.
 
#### Design
 
Design as a topic has always been very subjective. I’ll let you be the judge of which one takes the cake. I gotta say though, I dig those iPhone-like antennae lines on the Tecno.
 
#### Processor and Software
 
Tecno Spark has the advantage here. It comes running the more recent Android 7.0 Nougat while Infinix Smart runs the slightly older Android 6 Marshmallow. However, Infinix promises Nougat on the Smart. Both come skinned with their respective in-house skin; HiOS and XOS.
 
#### Battery
 
An odd place to start but let’s get the basics out of the way first. Tecno and Infinix phones have earned themselves the title “Battery Warriors”. The Spark and Smart come with 3,060mAH and 3,000mAH power packs respectively. This is impressive and with the modest internals we will talk about in a little bit, these will be more than adequate.
 
#### Display
 
Tecno Spark features 5.5-inch IPS display whereas the Infinix Smart comes with the 5-inch display. Both are 720p panels.  While many might consider these panels outdated, we cannot complain much considering the pricing of the two.
 
#### Camera
 
The Tecno Spark sports a 13 MP rear shooter with a single LED flash and a 5 MP front camera with soft flash. Infinix Smart comes with 8 MP rear camera with dual LED flash and 2 Mp front camera with soft flash as well.
 
The Spark clearly takes this one, at least on paper. Megapixels aren’t everything. We may have to play around with these cameras for a more detailed review and verdict.
 
#### Conclusion
 
Clearly, Tecno Spark slightly edges out the Infinix Smart. The fingerprint scanner, support for 4G LTE and the much nicer design make it more desirable than the Infinix Smart.
 
Infinix Smart’s audio-centric inclination make it a much better deal for the audiophiles among us. That said, both devices are very good if you’re on a tight budget.
 
#### Pricing
 
In Kenya, Tecno Spark goes on sale at Ksh 9,999 on e-commerce site Kilimall while Infinix Smart retails for Ksh 9,000 on Jumia.
