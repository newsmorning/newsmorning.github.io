title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Turned on my Sega Game Gear - Lines on Screen but No Picture!

Are you a long-time fan of the Sega Game Gear? Have you ever experienced turning it on only to find lines on the screen but no picture? If so, you're not alone! This unusual occurrence can happen for several reasons, and it's essential to know how to troubleshoot it.

First, let's discuss what the Sega Game Gear is and why it was such a revolutionary device during its time. The Game Gear was a handheld gaming console released in 1990 by Sega, and it was designed to compete with the Game Boy by Nintendo. The Game Gear featured a color backlit screen, which was a novelty back then, and it had a library of excellent games like Sonic the Hedgehog and Mortal Kombat.

Now, back to the issue at hand. Why would the Game Gear display lines on the screen but with no picture? Well, one common cause is a weak or dead capacitor. Game Gears are prone to this issue, and it is a result of stored voltage that causes capacitors to fail over time. A capacitor stores energy and releases it when needed during gameplay. In some cases, these capacitors, when old, leak or overheat, causing issues with the screen display.

Another reason the Game Gear could display lines on the screen is due to faulty connections caused by dust and dirt. For instance, if you haven't played your Game Gear in a while, dust and dirt can accumulate on the connectors, leading to poor connections between the console and the cartridge. In this scenario, a simple cleaning of the cartridge or the console connector using a soft cloth should fix the problem.

Additionally, if the Game Gear is displaying lines on the screen, but with no picture, it could be a sign of bad LCD screen resistance. The resistor is responsible for regulating the current flow within the LCD screen. If the resistor becomes damaged or gets compromised, lines will appear on the screen, and there won't be a picture.

In conclusion, turning on your Sega Game Gear should be a fun and exciting experience; however, seeing lines on the screen but with no picture can be a bit frustrating. As such, it's essential to know how to troubleshoot the issue. You can open the console and check for weak or dead capacitors, clean the connectors, or replace LCD screen resistors that may be causing the problem. 

No matter the solution, it's always worth the effort to fix your Game Gear, and who knows, next time you switch it on, you might be greeted with the iconic SEGA logo on a squeaky clean screen!

## Chosen Solution
 There is sound and I hear the game but have vertical lines and blocks of color on screen. Is it a bad screen or logic board?

 Claudine, based on your description it does sound like a bad screen. A picture of what your screen looks like may help, but first hunch is the display. Use this guide to replace it. Hope this helps, good luck.

 Check your capacitors, they may have blown.
