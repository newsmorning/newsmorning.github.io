# Shocking discovery! Your MacBook Pro's A1502 Water Moisture Indicators reveal a dangerous truth about your device's lifespan!

As a MacBook Pro user, you might not be aware of the tiny water moisture indicators placed inside your device to detect any water damage. These indicators are located inside the headphone jack and charging port of your MacBook Pro A1502 model. If you look closely, you can spot them as small white or silver dots.

These indicators are very sensitive and can easily detect even the slightest exposure to water or moisture. When the indicator comes in contact with water or moisture, it turns red, indicating that your device has suffered water damage. This is important to note, as Apple's warranty policy does not cover any water damage.

But what does this mean for the lifespan of your device? Well, it turns out that the water moisture indicators in your MacBook Pro A1502 model can help you determine the age and potential lifespan of your device. 

As a MacBook Pro owner, you might assume that your device can last for many years, even up to a decade with proper care and maintenance. However, if you notice that the water moisture indicators inside your device have turned red, even if it was a long time ago, it means that your device's lifespan may have been shortened, even if your device is still functioning correctly.

Water damage can cause corrosion on the internal components of your device, leading to long-term damage and failure. Over time, the corrosion will worsen, and eventually, your device will become unusable. The presence of red water moisture indicators indicates that your device has suffered water damage, which could lead to internal corrosion and shortened lifespan.

Therefore, it is important to keep an eye on the water moisture indicators in your MacBook Pro A1502 model. If you notice that they have turned red, you should take immediate steps to prevent further water damage, such as switching off your device and seeking professional help. If you ignore the warning signs, your device's lifespan is likely to be significantly reduced.

In conclusion, the presence of water moisture indicators inside your MacBook Pro A1502 reveals a dangerous truth about your device's lifespan. Water damage can cause long-term damage and shorten your device's lifespan, even if it is still functioning correctly. Therefore, it is essential to take precautions to avoid water damage to ensure that your device performs well and lasts as long as possible. Keep an eye on those little water moisture indicators, and you'll be able to prevent water damage before it's too late.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I just bought an 1502 MacBook Pro 13 early 2015 that spent a night outside and that has been revived by a tech that deoxydated it prevently. It works perfectly but I would like to see the water indicators because I would like to change the lcd which has the coating that scratched off ( officialy recognized and authorized replacement program ) , but I would like to know if there is any presence of liquid contact before taking it over apple store.
do you please know where is the moisture/water indicators on the MacBook Pro a1504 early 2015 please ?
thanks a lot!!!

 At this point I can tell you the logic board markers have been activated from the isopropyl alcohol so it's not really worth worrying about.
If you are concerned you still have damage then youâ€™ll need to go in and do a full cleaning your self.
