 Hi,
I have spilt water over my keyboard and my MacBook has died.
After extracting the SSD, it looks in good condition, with no corrosion to the pins.
This is the SSD and the pins:

I would like to either do one of the following:
Place this SSD into a 2.5” SATA enclosure, so I can place into my 2012 MacBook Pro 13” Unibody.Place this SSD into an adapter to plug into my Windows M.2 slot.Place this SSD into an adapter to connect over SATA or USB into my Windows PC.
Are there recommendations on any of the above options? I am in the UK.
Thanks!
