# You Won't Believe Why This Popular Hitachi Projector is Refusing to Turn On - The Reason is Jaw-Dropping!

If you're a fan of Hitachi projectors, you may have experienced days where your projector simply refused to turn on. In such instances, we often blame the projector lamp, the cables or the power supply as the root cause of the problem.

However, imagine trying to switch on your Hitachi projector only to find that the culprit for its malfunction is caused by something unusual - like mice? Yes, you heard it right, rodents!

Recently, a customer reached out to the Hitachi customer service team reporting that his popular Hitachi projector was refusing to turn on despite it being connected to a power source. The customer also reported that they heard strange noises coming from within the projector.

Upon closer inspection, the technicians discovered a surprising culprit - mice! It turned out that the rodents had made themselves comfortable inside the projector and chewed through the power cables and other essential components causing the projector to fail to turn on.

The shocked customer couldn't believe his eyes or ears. He had never even considered the possibility that mice could ruin his beloved projector. This is not the first incident of its kind. Other customers have also reported similar experiences; however, this is an exception rather than the norm.

It is essential to note that rodents are known for chewing through anything they come across, and electronic devices like projectors are not immune to their chew frenzy. In some cases, the rodents are attracted to the warm components of the projector, making it an attractive house for them to live in.

So, what's the solution? Does it mean you have to steer clear of investing in a projector? Well, it's relatively easy; all you have to do is take preventive measures to stop rodents from accessing your gadgets.

One of the easy and efficient methods is to keep the projector in a secure and sealed location. Avoid keeping it in areas with open windows or doors, which could let rodents in. If you are in an area where rodents are prevalent, consider investing in rodent-repelling devices such as traps and sprays.

In conclusion, while it may sound unbelievable, rodents can cause havoc to electronic devices such as a Hitachi projector. Therefore, it is essential to keep the device in a secure area and to take necessary precautions to deter rodents from making it their home. A little bit of prevention can save you lots of money and time in the long run.

## Chosen Solution
 My Hitachi Projector CP-X5021N, will not turn on
Power light is red, lamp and temp lights just flash amber.
Bulb was changed out after the fact, and im at a loss as nothing to tell me of this light error combination. Im thinking the power supply is dead, if thats the case where can i purchase anew one.

 @mohawkmafia you are right. There is no documentation about the POST blink codes as you described.


I wonder if this is not related to same temperature issue (check your fan etc.). Follow the flowchart from the SM for the Lamp-Does-Not-Light error and see if you can narrow it down



This might be useful for your repair as well Hitachi Cp X4021n Cp X5021n. As for the power supply it looks like the Hitachi number is HA03191 and you may have to try places like ebay.com etc. for a replacement or try to have yours repaired.
