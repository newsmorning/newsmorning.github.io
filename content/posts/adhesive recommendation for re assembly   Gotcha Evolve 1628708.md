# You won't believe the game-changing adhesive solution for the ultimate Evolve assembly!

When it comes to assembling complex structures like robots or machines, adhesive solutions play a critical role in ensuring the parts stick together securely and reliably. However, finding an adhesive that can meet the demands of high-performance applications while remaining flexible, lightweight, and easy to apply can be a daunting task. But what if we told you there's a game-changing adhesive solution that can revolutionize the way you approach your Evolve assembly project?

Introducing the innovative, versatile, and high-performing adhesive solution from XYZ Company, designed to outperform traditional bonding methods and deliver the ultimate Evolve assembly experience. With its advanced formulation and unique application properties, this adhesive offers a range of features and benefits that make it the go-to choice for engineers and builders looking to take their assembly process to the next level.

Some of the key benefits of this adhesive include:

### Superior bonding strength

The adhesive's advanced formula and chemical composition allow it to bond with a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics, composites, and more. This means you can use it to securely attach different parts of your Evolve assembly, without worrying about them loosening or separating over time.

### Excellent flexibility

Unlike conventional adhesives that can become brittle or crack over time, this adhesive solution remains flexible and pliable, even when exposed to extreme temperatures, vibrations, or shock. This makes it ideal for use in applications where durability and longevity are critical, such as in industrial or aerospace settings.

### Lightweight yet robust

Thanks to its low-density composition, this adhesive solution adds minimal weight to your Evolve assembly while still providing exceptional strength and durability. This means you can design and build lighter and more agile structures without compromising on performance or resilience.

### Easy to apply

One of the most significant advantages of this adhesive is its ease of use and application. Whether you're working with complicated shapes or hard-to-reach areas, the adhesive's flexible nozzle and controlled dispensing system allow for precise and consistent application, even in challenging environments.

Overall, the XYZ Company's adhesive solution represents a game-changing innovation in the world of Evolve assembly. By providing superior bonding strength, flexible and lightweight properties, and ease of application, this adhesive can help you achieve optimal performance, durability, and reliability for your Evolve project, and take your creations to new heights of excellence. So go ahead and try it out, you won't believe the difference it can make!

## Chosen Solution
 i'm looking for an adhesive recommendation to re-assemble a repaired Gotcha Evolve.  when i (very carefully) took it apart there was a bead of glue around the inner case perimeter (reminded me a lot of hot glue-gun glue).  it was very tacky but very flexible.  adhesion was good as it took a while to pry it off the base side.  i'd like to find something that A) does a good job of holding the top and bottom together
B) would still enable the separation of top and bottom (using the same technique of a thin blade or spudger to pry them apart without breaking them, in case i need to do further repairs
C) keep it's form when dispensed, unlike liquid glue that would just flow everywhere (self-leveling i think is the correct term).  if i put a seam of it down, i want it to hold that shape until i press the two pieces together.
any thoughts?

 T7000 or T8000, use it all the time on phones, tablets and watches etc.

 Hi @beekerc
Try using Tesa 61395 Tape.
It works well on phones, so perhaps it is also suitable for your device.
