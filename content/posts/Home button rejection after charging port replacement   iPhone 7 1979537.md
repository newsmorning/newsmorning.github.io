Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When You Replace Your iPhone 7 Charging Port - Home Button REJECTS you!

Introduction:
There are few things more frustrating than discovering that your iPhone won't charge. Often, a dead battery is caused by a faulty charging port. Replacing the charging port on your iPhone 7 could fix the issue, but what happens when it causes another problem? In this article, we'll explore what happens when you replace your iPhone 7 charging port and the home button rejects you.

Body:
The iPhone 7 is a modern marvel of technology, but it's not indestructible. Like all electronic devices, it's vulnerable to damage, and the charging port is a common culprit. If your iPhone 7's charging port is damaged, replacing it with a new one should be a straightforward process. However, sometimes, things can go wrong.

When replacing the charging port, there's a risk of damaging the home button. The home button is a crucial component of the iPhone 7, and it plays a significant role in the device's user interface. Since the home button and the charging port are located close to each other, it can be tough to avoid damaging the home button during the repair process.

If you replace your iPhone 7 charging port and the home button rejects you, it means that the home button no longer works correctly, and it's unable to register a click. This issue can occur when the home button is damaged during the repair, or when the replacement charging port is not compatible with the iPhone 7.

The home button is sensitive, and any damage could render it useless. It's essential to be careful when replacing the charging port and ensure that the home button is not damaged during the repair process.

Unfortunately, if the home button is damaged during the charging port replacement, you'll need to have it fixed by a professional. DIY repair attempts won't work when it comes to repairing the home button, and it's best to have it repaired by a technician who has the necessary skills and equipment to perform the repair.

Conclusion:
Replacing the charging port on your iPhone 7 can fix the charging issues that you may be experiencing, but it can come with a significant risk. Damaging the home button during the repair process can leave you in a frustrating situation where the home button rejects you. It's essential to take necessary precautions when repairing your device, or better yet, have it repaired by a professional to avoid further damage. Don't let a simple repair job turn into a costly and frustrating experience.

## Chosen Solution
 I run a repair shop and replace screens and other parts daily with no issue. But yesterday I came across a first:
A repeat customer came in and needed a new lightning port on his iPhone 7. Okay, it took  a little while because for the 7s you have to do a complete tear-down essentially.
Nothing went wrong during the replacement, and I tested the the new port and it all worked as it should. Now here’s where the problem is…
Even though I set the screen aside and didnt even TOUCH the home button at all, the phone no longer recognizes its native home button, BUT the digital home button wasnt turned on automatically as it would be if the phone just didnt see a home button period.
Is it possible that I maybe tripped some security flag and the phone disabled the home button as a security measure? Because *nothing* was torn or broken.
I should note that my manager has also in the past noticed some home button wierdness on a different 7 after a tear-down… after he put it back together every time you touch the home button, you hear a loud beep for a second or 2, like a smoke detector, then the phone shuts down. It seems like these are both security issues that has nothing to do with anything physical being broken.

 Something must be amiss. A torn ribbon or bad connector maybe.
We do hundreds of these and don’t have issues unless it’s torn etc.
The charge port flex flex can be changed without stripping the whole phone out, just remove sim tray and screws along that side and slide it under.

 Check the home button flex cable on the lcd, it might be torn a little and you can’t even notice it’s torn. I attached a picture for making it easy for you to understand
