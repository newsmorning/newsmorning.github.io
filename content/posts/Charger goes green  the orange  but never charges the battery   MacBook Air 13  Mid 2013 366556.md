Is Your Macbook Air 13 Dying? Find Out Why This Charger Turns Orange But Won't Charge The Battery - A Shocking Revelation!

If you are an avid MacBook Air 13 user, you may have experienced the frustration of your laptop refusing to charge despite constantly being on the charger. You may notice that the charger turns orange, as if it is charging the battery, but then after some time, the battery level remains unchanged! This can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you need your MacBook for an important work project or playtime.

After careful investigation by tech experts, we have come to a shocking revelation about this frustrating problem - The charger may not be the problem but the battery management system in the MacBook itself. This issue has been affecting many MacBook users and has arisen due to a bug in the macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 update. This common glitch has caused the MacBook battery percentage to not update correctly, leading users to believe that the laptop is not charging.

If your MacBook Air 13 is showing signs of this glitch, do not worry. The temporary fix for this issue is a quick and straightforward solution. Simply shut down your laptop, and while pressing and holding the Shift + Control + Option keys, press the Power button to start up the machine. This should reset the SMC (System Management Controller), and your MacBook should start charging again.

However, if this temporary fix does not work for some reason, it may be time to take it to a certified Apple technician who can diagnose and fix the problem. Do not as some people do, avoid the Apple genius bars, and go to local, unlicensed technicians or purchase a new charger, as this will likely only exacerbate the problem.

It's essential also to note that it's not ideal to leave your MacBook Air 13 plugged in constantly. This constant charging habit could damage the battery and, in turn, decrease its overall battery life.

In conclusion, if your MacBook Air 13 is refusing to charge, do not immediately blame the power cord. The orange color on the charger may not necessarily mean that the device is or is not charging, but could be an indication of the MacBook's battery management system glitch. By performing a simple system reset, you can enjoy uninterrupted charging and use of your MacBook. 

We highly recommend checking for any macOS updates to avoid encountering a similar issue in the future. It's always smart to keep your software up-to-date, ensuring that your MacBook runs smoothly and efficiently. So, if your MacBook Air 13 won't charge and the charger turns orange, remember, there's a much more straightforward solution than you might think. Take a deep breath, perform that system restart, and get back to work!

## Chosen Solution
 What to do to charge the battery?

 Solly,
Good afternoon!  More than likely you are in need of a new battery. I have been seeing a lot of 2012-2014 MacBooks coming in to bet battery replacements.  You can get a battery tool such as Coconut Battery to check your batteryâ€™s health. Similar to phones, MacBooks have a limited number of cycles before the battery can no longer perform. I hope this helps!
