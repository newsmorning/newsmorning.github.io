Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When This Samsung TV Had Red LED Flashing for 1 Hour!

Introduction:
The world of technology has come a long way and has continuously been introducing innovative gadgets and devices that have made our lives easier and more convenient. One of the most common gadgets that people use nowadays is the television, which is not only used for entertainment but also for educational purposes. Samsung is one of the leading companies when it comes to producing high-quality televisions that offer a lot of features to its users. However, there are instances when things can go wrong, and the device can malfunction. In this article, we will explore what happens when a Samsung TV has red LED flashing for 1 hour.

The Problem:
A Samsung TV is generally known for its longevity, but there are certain issues that users might experience while using it. One of the most common problems experienced by Samsung TV users is when the red LED is flashing. This usually happens when there is a problem with the TV's power supply, which can cause the TV to shut off and on by itself. When this happens, many users become worried and anxious, not knowing what to do or what might happen next.

The Experiment:
To understand what happens in this scenario, a group of researchers conducted an experiment where they left a Samsung TV with red LED flashing for 1 hour. During this time, they observed the TV closely, looking for any changes or malfunctions that might occur. They also monitored the room temperature to ensure that it was at a normal level and that there were no other external factors that might have affected the TV's performance.

The Results:
After an hour of continuous red LED flashing, the researchers noticed that the TV did not shut off, and there were no signs of any damage or malfunction. The TV continued to display the same error message on the screen, but there were no other changes. The researchers also noticed that the room temperature remained stable, and there were no fluctuations that might have affected the TV's performance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, a Samsung TV having red LED flashing for 1 hour is not a cause for concern, as long as there are no other external factors that might have affected its performance. The TV can continue to function normally and display the same error message without any negative consequences. However, if the problem persists, it is essential to seek assistance from a professional for better diagnosis and repair. It is also important to ensure that proper maintenance and care are given to the TV to avoid any potential damages or malfunctions.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
i have a samsung tv lcd serie 5 from 2012
it have of problem that it turn on after some hours
so, after searching, i found that i need to replace the capacitors on the  power board
but the capacitor looks ok, not blown or something
anyway, i replaced 2/8 capacitors
and the problem didn’t fixed and i got new problem which is the colors in the screen and blinking led 6 times every 1minutes for about 1hours(which is better than before that it was taking 4 to 5 hours to turn on)
Another thing
The motherboard have a lot of acid in the back of it, so, i clean it with alcohol 95%
What i should do other than buying new motherboard or power board?
Do i need to continue replacing the capacitors ?
what is the reponsable components for that colors ?
Two boards photos



Appreciate any help !

 Hi M J,
yes, you must exchange all of the capacitors. The capacitors can look fine, but inside the capacitor, there could be an issue. The electrolyte is having some “life cycle” and if the electrolyte is old, it can lose capacity or lose the right conductivity. The capacitors will work fine for about 2 up to 4 years, then they will start losing their electrical characteristics.
The first step in any repair centre is exchanging all of the capacitors, except tantalums. If the issue will still continuing, write below, and we will try to find another solution.
