Title: You Won't Believe the Shocking Reason Why Your Ipod Touch 5th Gen Home Button Isn't Clicking!

Introduction:
If you own an iPod Touch 5th Gen, you know how convenient and enjoyable it is to use the device’s home button. However, if your home button stops clicking, it can be a frustrating experience. You might have tried restarting your device, resetting it, or cleaning the button. But, have you considered the possibility of a software glitch? In this article, we will discuss the surprising reason why your home button may not be clicking and how you can fix it.

The Problem:
The iPod Touch 5th Gen comes with a feature called the “AssistiveTouch,” which allows users to perform functions such as taking screenshots, activating Siri, or locking the screen, without using the physical buttons on the device. If you have enabled this feature accidentally or intentionally, it can cause your home button to stop clicking. So, while you might think that the problem is with the button itself, the actual problem lies in the software settings.

The Solution:
The good news is that the solution is pretty straightforward. Suppose you have enabled the AssistiveTouch feature on your iPod Touch 5th Gen, disabling it can help get your home button clicking again.

To disable AssistiveTouch:

1. Go to the “Settings” app on your iPod Touch 5th Gen.
2. Select “General.”
3. Tap on “Accessibility.”
4. Select “AssistiveTouch.”
5. Toggle the switch to “Off.”

Once you disable the AssistiveTouch feature, your home button should start working correctly.

Conclusion:
While it may seem like a minor inconvenience, a non-clicking home button can significantly affect your overall user experience. By knowing the reason behind this issue, you can quickly fix it yourself, without having to visit a service center or spending money on repairs. So, the next time you experience these issues, be sure to try the method mentioned above before heading to the service center.

## Chosen Solution
 As the title suggests my iPod's 5th gen home button no longer clicks. Is it the actual button itself or is it something deeper?

 My sister had a similar problem. She did a factory reset and it fixed the problem.
