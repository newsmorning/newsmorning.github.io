Electric Nightmare! RCA RCT6272W23 Charged All Night But Refuses to Power On - Find Out What Went Wrong!

Are you one of the many owners of an RCA RCT6272W23 tablet who have been left scratching their heads in confusion? Have you charged your tablet all night and have found that it refuses to power on? If your answer is yes, then do not fret! This article will guide you through what went wrong and how you can resolve the issue.

Firstly, let's examine what might have gone wrong. The problem may lie in one of the following:

1. Damaged Battery: The battery might have become damaged or faulty, preventing the tablet from turning on, despite being fully charged.

2. Broken Charger or Charging Port: The charger or charging port of your tablet might have become damaged, causing the battery not to charge properly, and consequently, your tablet refuses to power on.

3. Firmware Glitch: It is also possible that a firmware glitch or bug has affected the tablet's operating system, resulting in it failing to start up.

Now that we have identified some of the possible issues, let's look at the ways we can resolve them.

1. Check the Battery: If you think the battery is the problem, the first thing you can do is disconnect the battery and clean the connectors. After that, reconnect the battery and try turning on the tablet. If this does not work, then try replacing the battery.

2. Check the Charger and Charging Port: To check if the charger or charging port is damaged, you can test the charger in another device or try using another charger with your tablet. If neither of these works, the charging port itself may be damaged and will need to be replaced.

3. Update the Firmware: Updating the firmware is another option if you suspect a software issue. The steps for doing this will vary depending on the make and model of your tablet, but you can search for specific instructions online.

In conclusion, these are some of the ways you can resolve the issue of your RCA RCT6272W23 tablet refusing to power on even though it has been charged all night. Always remember to be cautious when handling electronic devices, and if you are not sure, it is best to seek professional help or consult the manufacturer.


## Chosen Solution
 Why won't my tablet come on or charge?

 Maybe the battery has gone bad.
Do you have another tablet like that, which works?
If so then try taking the battery (if possible) out of the tablet that isn't coming on or charging and put the battery which  is in the working tablet into the other tablet, if it works then you know the battery has gone bad. (make sense?)
However if you don't have any other tablets try replacing the battery.
Though the port thingy where you put the cable in to charge could of fried whilst it was charging..

 It dont want to keep a charge and it cross on the main screem
