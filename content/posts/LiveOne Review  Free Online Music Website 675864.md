This music streaming service works by having you create custom radio stations built around the songs and artists you like, where it will then mix in related content to deliver you the music you like as well as content it thinks you'll enjoy.

##   Thoughts on LiveOne  
 

This service is very similar to other music streaming sites/apps that let you build custom radio stations, like Pandora and Spotify. However, where it stands out is in the live events and user-friendliness.

 

Although you can't pick the exact songs you want to listen to, building a custom station will likely run through your songs, eventually. Otherwise, it's a great way to find new music you may not have heard before, but are related to the songs you do like.

 

One thing that's bothersome about LiveOne is that some of the features you try to access will tell you that it's only available if you pay for a membership. These options are indicated by a small red dot.

 

Also, as with any service that's free, you'll likely find advertisements and commercials, which is what you have with the LiveOne app. You might find this acceptable, though, considering all the music is free. Plus, you can upgrade to a membership plan to remove the ads if you wish.
