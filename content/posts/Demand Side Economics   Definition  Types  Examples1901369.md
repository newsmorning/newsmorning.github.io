Revolutionize Your Financial Game with Demand Side Economics - Everything You Need to Know Including Types and Real-Life Examples!

Many people know the basics of supply and demand economics - supply refers to the amount of goods or services available, and demand refers to the number of people who want to buy them. But have you ever heard of demand side economics, and how it can revolutionize your financial game?

Demand side economics, also known as Keynesian economics, is a theory that focuses on the idea that economic growth comes from increasing demand. This theory suggests that by increasing demand for goods and services, businesses will produce more, and in turn, hire more workers, which will lead to overall economic growth.

Here's everything you need to know about demand side economics, including its types and real-life examples:

Types of Demand Side Economics:

1. Fiscal Policy: Fiscal policy refers to the government's use of taxes, spending, and other policies to influence the economy. In demand side economics, the government will increase spending, decrease taxes, or both, to increase demand for goods and services.

2. Monetary Policy: Monetary policy refers to the government's control of the money supply and interest rates. In demand side economics, the government will lower interest rates to encourage people to borrow and spend more, thereby increasing demand.

3. Investment Policy: Investment policy refers to government policies that encourage investment in new businesses and startups, which can lead to more jobs and increased demand for goods and services.

Real-Life Examples of Demand Side Economics:

1. The New Deal: During the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented the New Deal, which included massive public works programs and other government spending to boost demand and create jobs.

2. Economic Stimulus Packages: In recent years, many governments have implemented economic stimulus packages that include tax cuts, infrastructure projects, and other measures to boost demand and stimulate economic growth.

3. Unemployment Benefits: Unemployment benefits allow people who are out of work to continue spending money, which can increase demand for goods and services in the short term and help boost the economy.

In conclusion, demand side economics is a powerful tool that can help individuals and governments revolutionize their financial game. By focusing on increasing demand for goods and services, we can stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and improve our standard of living. So the next time you're thinking about your financial strategy, remember the power of demand side economics!

## Demand-Side Economics Definition
 
The main purpose of the demand-side theory is to increase the money supply. Keynes claims that increased product demand stimulates increased economic activities and employment. Expansionary measures are taken by governments to deal with recessions. Governments initiate new projects to create jobs and lower income taxes. In addition, governments curtail interest rates on loans to increase consumers’ liquidity.

Key Takeaways

 
- Demand-side economics or Keynesian theory considers the demand for goods and services as the main factor behind economic growth. The theory claims that goods supply alone is not adequate for enhancing an economy.The supply-side theory focuses on the rich and business owners. The demand theory, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of increased money supply and demand.Increased purchasing power increases goods demand. This triggers production, and the economy requires more employment. Ultimately, an increase in demand results in economic growth.

 
### Demand-Side Economics Explained
 
Demand-side economics claims that economic growth is predominantly caused by demand for products. This economic theory was first put forth by John Meynard Keynes in the 1930s. Keynes proposed this model in response to the failure of classical economics during the great depression.

The Keynesian theory is the opposite of the classical theory of supply-side economics. Classical economics (supply-side) claims that goods supply is the most important growth factor. Keynes argues that a manufacturing plant may produce noticeable quantity, but unless there is a demand, there won’t be any sales—the economy won’t improve. Demand, in turn, depends on the consumer’s purchasing power.
 
The theory also advocates the use of expansionary monetary policies—when government infuses money into circulation—the consumer’s purchasing power rises. Central banks use monetary policies to control money circulation—by increasing or decreasing interest rates on loans.
 
Also, governments reduce taxes on income and commodities to increase consumers’ purchasing power. The demand side theory advocates the use of such governmental measures. Increased purchasing power—increases goods demand—triggers production, and requires more employment. Ultimately, an increase in demand results in economic growth.
 
### Types
 
There are two major demand-side policies in economics—monetary policy and fiscal policy.
 
#### #1 Monetary policy 
 
This approach involves the regulation of credit or borrowing-related costs. Monetary policies are drafted by a country’s central bank—in the US, The Federal Reserve brings out monetary policies. It is an autonomous body that can make economic decisions without political interference.
 
For example, when a country undergoes economic slumps, the central bank uses expansionary policies (demand-side approach) to reduce interest rates on loans. When borrowing becomes easier for individuals and businesses, the circulation of money also increases. Increased money supply triggers a chain of events—ultimately, employment levels rise.  
 
#### #2 Fiscal policy 
 
This approach involves a change in income tax rates and an increase in government spending. The government invests in new infrastructure projects to put more money into the hands of the consumers. In addition, the government curtails taxes on consumers—income tax.
 
### Example
 
During the 2008 US recession, President Obama employed demand-side policies to tackle downward trends. He applied a string of economic measures:
 
- Reducing interest rates on loans.Reducing the income tax burden on the American middle-class.Pushing for a $787 billion stimulus package into the economy.

 
This was the most comprehensive economic reform in American history since the 1930s great depression. The demand-side approach makes a visible dent irrespective of the size of an economy.
 
### Supply-Side vs. Demand-Side Economics
 
Both supply-side economics and demand theory chart the economic progress of a nation. Both theories discuss factors like curtailed taxes, new projects, infrastructure development, and government spending. Supply-side approach Vs. demand-side approach differences are as follows:

The demand-side theory was first proposed by John Maynard Keynes. Keynes believed that the growth of an economy is impossible without creating demand for goods and services. Moreover, he advocated that the demand-sided approach generates employment.
 
According to the demand-side theory, the output of goods and services is directly correlated to market demand. With the increased consumer demand, spending increases—ultimately businesses grow, and employment is generated. Consequentially, the effect of demand gets multiplied—furthering the enhancement of economic growth.
 
Expansionary measures are employed by governments when economic growth is stifled. During increased unemployment scenarios, governments create new projects—to create new jobs—to infuse money into circulation.
 
The demand-side theory strongly advocates the need for increasing product demand. The theory claims that demand is the predominant factor behind economic growth. Supply-side economists, on the other hand, emphasize the importance of manufacturers. The supply-side approach incentivizes producers—anticipating new products, increased production, and even new jobs—to fulfill production requirements.
