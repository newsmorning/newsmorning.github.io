The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines your income tax liability based on your taxable income, which is your total income after deductions and exemptions. Your tax liability is calculated based on income tax rates that increase as your income increases. Your income tax liability can be reduced by claiming deductions, such as mortgage interest or charitable contributions.\nWhat is Payroll Tax? Payroll tax is a tax that is withheld from your paycheck by your employer. The payroll tax includes two parts: Social Security tax and Medicare tax.

Income tax allows for various deductions and credits, such as education expenses, medical expenses, and retirement contributions. However, payroll tax does not offer any deductions or credits to lower your tax bill.\nTiming of Payments: Income tax is paid annually and can be paid in a lump sum or through estimated quarterly tax payments. Payroll tax is withheld from your paycheck throughout the year, so you don’t have to worry about a large tax bill at the end of the year.\nInfographics:\nThe following infographics demonstrate the differences between income tax and payroll tax:\nInfographic 1: Income Tax vs. Payroll Tax\n[Include an image that shows the differences in tax rates, deductions and credits, and timing of payments between income tax and payroll tax]\nInfographic 2: Top Tax-saving Tips\n[Include an image that outlines tips for reducing your tax bill, such as contributing to a retirement account, claiming deductions, and taking advantage of tax credits]\nConclusion:\nUnderstanding the differences between income tax and payroll tax can help you save big on your tax bill.
