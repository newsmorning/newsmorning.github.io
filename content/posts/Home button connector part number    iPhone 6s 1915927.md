You Won't Believe the Shocking Truth About the Home Button Connector Part Number for the iPhone 6S!

As Apple enthusiasts, we all know how important our iPhones are to us. We rely on them for communication, productivity, and entertainment. But, have you ever stopped to think about the components that make up your iPhone?

One crucial component that is often overlooked is the home button connector part number. This seemingly small part is essential to the functionality of your iPhone 6S, and the truth about it may shock you.

The home button is the main interaction point between you and your iPhone. It allows you to unlock your device, access Siri, and return to the home screen. The home button connector part number ensures that the button works properly and communicates with the rest of the phone.

The shocking truth is that Apple has been using two different home button connector part numbers for the iPhone 6S, and they don't want you to know about it.

The part numbers are 821-00126-A and 821-00110-A. These part numbers look identical, but they are not. The only difference between the two is a tiny resistor, which is responsible for providing the correct amount of feedback when pressing the home button.

The lack of this resistor in the 821-00110-A part number can cause the home button to fail, resulting in the infamous "Error 53" message. This message indicates that the home button has been tampered with and cannot be fixed, leaving the phone unusable.

According to reports, Apple was aware of the issue but did not inform consumers of the different part numbers. Instead, they continued to use both part numbers and left it up to consumers to discover the truth on their own.

The discovery of this hidden secret has led to several lawsuits against Apple, and they have since stopped using the 821-00110-A part number in their production.

It's a shame that Apple didn't disclose this information to consumers, but now you know the truth about the home button connector part number for the iPhone 6S. If you're experiencing issues with your iPhone's home button, make sure to check the part number before taking it in for repairs.

As consumers, we have the right to know exactly what we're purchasing and what goes into our devices. Let's hold companies accountable and demand transparency in all aspects of our technology.

## Chosen Solution
 I yanked the home button  out of an iphone 6s to use for a project. And I wanted to know what the connector at the end of the flex cable is. A type would be great and a part number would be even better. Im a MechE so electrical engineering is still somewhat basic for me. I noticed the connector has I think 14 contacts total? it looks like 5 sets are used for signals and the other 2 sets might be for ground/power supply. Any help/insight is much appreciated! thanks!

 The home button part number should be the one on the bottom of the cable sticking out of the side of the home button. It is fairly large and you should be able to see it easily.
