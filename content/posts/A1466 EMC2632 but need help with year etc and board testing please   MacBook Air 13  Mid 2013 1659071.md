## Board Testing Tips for MacBook Air A1466 EMC2632

If you're experiencing technical issues with your MacBook Air A1466 EMC2632, it's important to run some tests to determine the cause. One of the most significant tests you can perform is board testing, an inspection that aims to identify any hardware or power issues.

Here are some tips to help you test your MacBook Air A1466 EMC2632 board:

1. Check the MagSafe Board: The MagSafe board connects the charging cable to the logic board. It's essential to ensure that it's working correctly, as a malfunctioning of this board will prevent your MacBook Air from charging.

2. Inspect the Logic Board: The logic board is the brain of your MacBook Air, responsible for running all the processes. If you're experiencing performance issues, you must check the logic board to rule out any hardware problems.

3. Test the I/O Board: The I/O board consists of the ports and the connectors that allow you to connect external devices. If you're having trouble connecting external devices to your MacBook Air, you should check this board to see if it's working correctly.

4. Check the TrackPad: The TrackPad is a significant component of your MacBook Air, responsible for interpreting your finger movements as cursor movements. If you're experiencing cursor jumps, cursor resistance, or scrolling issues, then you should get your trackpad checked.

Conclusion:

By following these tips for identifying your MacBook Air A1466 EMC2632's year and running some board tests, you can ensure that you get the most out of your device. Knowing your MacBook Air model type and keeping it up-to-date is essential to ensure that you have the right tools for your needs, while proper board testing can help you diagnose any technical issues proactively.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi iFixit members,
I have been given a Macbook Air 13" A1466 EMC2632 by a friend. Lucky me I hear you all saying LOL..
Well it's not as simple as that. It has unfortuntely had a Tea spillage so I need to do some thorough testing and possible parts replacement...BUT I have done a full Board clean up, with IPA and light air blower, and physically cannot see any corrosion or nasty component damage.
My friend advised me that it is a 2015 model with the extras added (that I can see on the OEM sticker but I need to ensure that the Schematic I am I following is correct to the physical laptop.
Board identification is as follows:
820-3437-B
MLB 1.7G HY 8G SI (not sure what the HY and SI mean though)
Also could really do with some guidance in regards to the multimeter testing, such as what Parts essentially need to being connected up so that I get proper accurate readings.....and also Diode Mode or Resistance mode or Both preferred for testing the circuit.
And lastly, what I should look out for in regards to drink spillage etc.. but I cannot see any components which look like they are fried or corroded.
I have read a forum on here that mentions the 2015 model requires the battery connected to complete tests, but I am unsure if this is a 2015 model or earlier model.
Your help would be very kindly apprecited thank you
Paul

 Given the systems age you likely need a new battery MacBook Air 13" (Late 2010-2017) Battery to really do any serious testing or even get it to run.
A tea spill into the keyboard likely damaged the keyboard and/or trackpad so consider these costs as well.
If you get it going what is your plan of usage? Also consider the highest Apple supported OS is OS-X Mavericks (10.9.5).
You'll need to locate a set of schematics and boardview drawings to work off of. Diagnosing a logic board will take a bit of work I would recommend you jump over to Louis Rossmann: The most Common Macbook Air logic board failure - how to fix
