Title: The Mystery of iPhone 5S Touch ID Failures Unveiled

Introduction:
Apple’s iPhone 5S was the first to introduce the Touch ID, which made unlocking phones faster and easier. The Touch ID technology relies on the home button, which serves as a fingerprint scanner. However, many iPhone 5S users have been experiencing touch ID failures even though their home button works perfectly. This issue has been a mystery to many, and in this article, we’ll uncover what’s really going on.

The Problem:
The Touch ID is not working, and it is preventing iPhone 5S users from unlocking their devices. Many have tried soft resets, hard resets, and even restoring their devices, but the problem persists. Apple has not provided any clear solutions to the problem, which has been frustrating for users who have paid a premium price for their iPhones.

The Cause:
After extensive research, it turns out that the cause of Touch ID failures is the home button cable. The cable connects the home button to the phone’s logic board, and over time it can wear out or become damaged. When this happens, the Touch ID functionality stops working even though the home button still functions properly.

The Solution:
The solution to this issue is to replace the home button cable, which can be done by a professional. If you have experience with repairing electronics, you can also purchase a replacement cable online and install it yourself. However, this is not recommended as it is a complex process that can cause more damage to your device if not done correctly.

Prevention:
To prevent future Touch ID failures, it is important to protect your iPhone 5S from physical damage. Accidental drops or bumps can cause the home button cable to become dislodged or damaged. Consider investing in a protective case or screen protector to keep your device safe. If you experience any issues with your Touch ID or home button, it is best to get it fixed as soon as possible to prevent further damage.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the mystery of iPhone 5S Touch ID failures has been uncovered! It turns out that the cause is the home button cable, which can become damaged over time. The solution is to get it replaced by a professional, and prevention is key to avoid future issues. By protecting your device from physical damage, you can ensure that your Touch ID will function properly for years to come. Now that you know the cause of the problem, you can confidently get it fixed and continue using your iPhone 5S with ease.

 Hi.
My friend i have exact same problem.
After replacing screen, home buttom working good but touch ID does not working
I try soft reset home buttom + power buttom it still the same
And  i try to reset the phone using iTunes it did  not work too :(
Any suggest  boss :)

 Normally iphone 5s home button set include a touch IC(only match with your iphone 5s motherboard). I think your iPhone 5s screen replacement include new home button set. that is the reason why touch ID not working. you can use old home button set to new screen.

 Only the ORIGINAL home button will ever work with Touch ID... unless you get it repaired by Apple. You would need to remove the original button from broken screen and place it in your new one to retain Touch ID.

 Try to configure new finger. If you get an error it mean that someone replaced home button before. It's not possible (for now) to repair it because Touch ID chip is paired with CPU.
