Nightmare: My LG Studio Refrigerator Keeps Shutting Down Due to Cf E Error and Broken Fan!

I have always been a huge fan of LG's products, especially their refrigerators. However, my recent experience with my LG Studio refrigerator has turned into a complete nightmare.

It all started when I noticed that my refrigerator was not cooling properly. I initially thought it was just a minor issue, and I did not pay much attention to it. However, as time went by, the situation worsened. My refrigerator kept shutting down, and I would often find my food spoiled.

I decided to seek professional help and contacted LG's customer support. They guided me through some troubleshooting steps, but unfortunately, none of them worked. After a few days, they sent a technician to my house, who diagnosed the issue and informed me that the refrigerator's fan was broken.

I was relieved that the issue had been identified, but my relief was short-lived as the technician informed me that the part needed to repair the fan was not available, and I would have to wait for weeks. I was shocked and frustrated with the entire situation, especially during the pandemic, when food preservation is more critical than ever.

To make matters worse, I noticed an error code, "Cf E" displayed on my refrigerator's screen, indicating a communication issue between the refrigerator and the control board. I immediately contacted customer support, and after several calls and emails, they finally sent a new control board.

After installation, I was hopeful that everything would be back to normal, but I was in for another unpleasant surprise. My refrigerator kept shutting down, and the "Cf E" error kept reappearing.

I contacted LG's customer support once again, and after several tests, they found out that the new control board was also defective, and they would have to send me a replacement.

It took nearly a month for LG to replace the control board, and I had to endure the ordeal of having a non-functional refrigerator for that entire period. After the replacement, the refrigerator seems to be working fine for now, but I am still skeptical about its durability.

This entire experience has been a nightmare for me, and I hope that LG will take my feedback into account and improve their customer service and product quality. I believe that it is essential for companies to take accountability for their products and ensure customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, if you are planning to purchase an LG refrigerator, do your research and read reviews carefully. It is crucial to ensure that the product is of high quality, and the company's customer support is reliable. If you find yourself in a similar situation, do not hesitate to raise your voice and demand better services.

## Chosen Solution
 LG Studio refrigerator constantly gets the CF E code. I take the back off, vacuum and the FAN is not running. I spin the fan to see if I can jump start it and nothing. Miraculously, it comes back on AFTER the back cover have been off for several minutes. I close it up,  set everything back to normal and sometimes within a day, a week or sometimes a few months, the FAN shuts off again and I have to do it all over again. It's as if when I open it up, the temperature drops and  the refrigerator starts the fan again. Any help, info on what it could be? Thanks in advance.

 Hi @randomdiyguy ,
Hereâ€™s how to test the condenser fan to determine whether the problem is in the pcb, a faulty connection (at either end) or the fan itself.
Hopefully this is of some help.
