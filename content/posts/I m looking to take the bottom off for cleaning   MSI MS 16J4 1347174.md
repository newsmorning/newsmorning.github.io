Shocking! Discover How To Strip MSI MS 16J4 For a Deep Clean - You Won't Believe What You'll Find!

Are you having problems with your MSI MS 16J4 laptop? If you're experiencing issues like overheating, slow performance, and constant system crashes, it might be time for a deep clean. But before you rush off to your local computer repair shop, you might want to try stripping your laptop to give it a thorough cleaning. And trust us; you won't believe what you'll find!

Here's how to strip your MSI MS 16J4 laptop for a deep clean:

Step 1: Turn off your laptop and disconnect it from the power source.

Always turn off your laptop before attempting to strip it down. And to prevent electrocution, make sure you disconnect the device from any power source.

Step 2: Remove the battery.

Removing the battery is the first step in stripping down your laptop. Look for the release switch, press it, and hold in the latch. Slide out the battery from the back of the device.

Step 3: Unscrew the back panel.

Flip your laptop over and locate the screws holding the back panel in place. You'll need a screwdriver that fits the screws' size. Unscrew each screw one at a time and put them in a safe place. Next, gently slide off the back panel.

Step 4: Remove the keyboard.

Once you remove the back panel, you'll see the keyboard's screws holding it in place. Unscrew these screws, and carefully lift the keyboard. Look out for the plug holding the keyboard in place.

Step 5: Clean the heat sink and ventilation system.

The heat sink and ventilation system are probably the dirtiest parts of your laptop. Use compressed air to clean the dust and debris off these parts. For stubborn dirt, use a soft brush. Wipe away any stubborn dirt with a damp cloth.

Step 6: Remove any plugs obstructing the access to the motherboard.

Carefully remove any plugs holding the motherboard in place. Follow the motherboard’s instructions carefully and only remove the plugs you need to while cleaning.

Step 7: Clean the motherboard and other components.

Take a soft and anti-static cloth, and use it to clean each component. Avoid using any type of liquid, which can damage your device.

Step 8: Reconnect plugs and replace any components.

After cleaning the motherboard and other components, it's time to reconnect the plugs you removed. Reconnect each plug to its rightful place, and any other components you removed, like the keyboard.

Step 9: Replace the back panel.

Once everything is back in place, slide the back panel back into place and screw it in tightly. Finally, put back the battery, and you're good to go.

Conclusion:

Stripping down your MSI MS 16J4 laptop can be intimidating, but it's worth it to give it a deep clean now and again. Dust and debris can cause significant problems, like overheating and sluggish performance. But once you've stripped it down and given it a thorough cleaning, you'll be surprised at how much better your laptop will run!

## Chosen Solution
 Simple enough. I’ve taken out all of the screws on the bottom panel, but it looks like stuff like the headphone/microphone jack are trying to come off with it. Any help would be great

 The trick with MSI is to unlatch the 3 sides before removing the cover - 100% not required, but get as many clips as you can. Once you unclip most of it, then you can stick something like a guitar pick by the jacks since you can use the leverage to sneak it in.
