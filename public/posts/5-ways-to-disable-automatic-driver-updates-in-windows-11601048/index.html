You can easily update your Windows 11 drivers manually or disable them to prevent such issues.\nCan Windows 11 update drivers automatically? Yes, Windows can update drivers automatically. If you have an old computer, it’s possible that you won’t have the latest driver for your hardware and Windows will prompt you to install them. As you might already know, your computer’s hardware and software components are controlled by drivers. Driver updates are important for more than just security reasons.\nNewer drivers often include bug fixes, performance enhancements, and security improvements that weren’t present in older versions of the driver. When you connect a new device to your computer, Windows will automatically search for the best-matching driver from its own database or from Windows Update. If it finds a match, it will install the driver and you’ll be able to use the device right away.\nWhile automatic driver updates are a great thing, they can also cause problems. Most of the time, the built-in Windows drivers work just fine.

Fewer issues – When you use up-to-date drivers, you’re less likely to experience computer problems such as screen flickering or system crashes.

Most of the time, the built-in Windows drivers work just fine. But problems can occur when Windows gets an outdated or incorrect driver from the manufacturer’s website. </p><p>If a driver isn’t installed correctly, it could cause issues such as frequent errors and crashes or even damage to your hardware. In such cases, it is important to disable automatic updates.</p><h3 id=how-do-i-keep-all-my-drivers-up-to-date>How do I keep all my drivers up to date? <a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-i-keep-all-my-drivers-up-to-date>#</a></h3><p>Driver updates are critical to keeping your PC running at its best. Other reasons include:</p><ul><li>Better performance – Updated drivers can improve your computer’s performance by reducing system crashes and other errors, as well as fixing issues with power management.</li><li>Security – Newer drivers usually include security patches that help protect against malware attacks.</li><li>Better compatibility – Newer drivers are often designed to be more compatible with the latest hardware and software.</li><li>Fewer issues – When you use up-to-date drivers, you’re less likely to experience computer problems such as screen flickering or system crashes.</li></ul><p>It can be hard to keep track of which driver updates you’ve installed, let alone newer versions that are available. Windows Update does a good job but you have to manually check and select the updates you wish to install.</p><p>This is where an automatic tool comes in. DriverFix is designed for users who have little or no experience in updating drivers but want to keep their computers running smoothly at all times. </p><p>This product is also ideal for those who would rather not spend hours trying to find the right driver on their own. DriverFix will scan your system for all missing, corrupt, and outdated drivers and automatically download the correct version of this driver from the Internet. </p><h2 id=how-do-i-disable-automatic-driver-updates-in-windows-11>How do I disable automatic driver updates in Windows 11? <a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-i-disable-automatic-driver-updates-in-windows-11>#</a></h2><h3 id=1-use-the-settings-app>1.
