## Chosen Solution
 Does anyone know how to fix the LG V20 that can't pickup any GPS signals?
I tried to tighten all of the screws in the back plate, clean the contact terminal (even pushed it up a little bit) and the antenna terminal. In addition, I have tried the Aluminum trick by adding a layer of Aluminum between the antenna's terminal and the phone's contact terminal. None of these tricks fixed the issue. Also, I reset the phone, but no lucks. Any suggestions/recommendations are greatly appreciated.

 Major GPS issues.  High Accuracy is on.
this is only two months old.  LG refuses to warranty because it is an "unlocked" phone! (what??)
Newegg won't help.  I am DONE with LG.  Never again.  My G3 had really bad wifi.
Now really bad GPS.  Also LTE cell reception is at least two bars lower than anyone around me is getting on the same network.
I liked this phone for the hi audio quality but bad reception and bad GPS is a deal breaker.  Wish I knew this before I bought.
