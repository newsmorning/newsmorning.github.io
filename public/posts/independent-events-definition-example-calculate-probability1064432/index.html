Independent events probability is one of the most important and fundamental concepts in mathematics, and once you understand it, you’ll be able to solve a range of mathematical problems with ease.\nIn this article, we will learn the definition of independent events probability, how to calculate it, and see some examples that will help you to better understand the concept. So let’s begin!\nBody:\nDefinition of Independent Events Probability:\nIndependent events probability is the probability that two or more events will occur independently of each other. In other words, the outcome of one event has no effect on the outcome of the other event.\nThe formula for independent events probability is:\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)\nWhere P(A and B) is the probability of both events occurring, P(A) is the probability of event A occurring, and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring.\nHow to Calculate Independent Events Probability:\nCalculating independent events probability is quite simple. Let’s take an example to understand how it works.\nExample:\nSuppose you are rolling two dice. What is the probability of rolling a 3 on one die and a 4 on the other?\nSolution:\nThe probability of rolling a 3 on one die is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 4 on the other die is also 1/6. Since these two events are independent (the outcome of one die doesn’t affect the outcome of the other), we can calculate the probability of both events occurring by multiplying the probabilities together:\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a 3 on one die and a 4 on the other is 1/36.\nAnother Example:\nSuppose you have a bag that contains three red balls and four blue balls. What is the probability of picking a red ball and then picking a blue ball without replacement?\nSolution:\nThe probability of picking a red ball on the first draw is 3/7, since there are three red balls out of seven total balls. After the first draw, there are six balls remaining in the bag, of which three are blue. Therefore, the probability of picking a blue ball on the second draw is 3/6, or 1/2.\nSince these two events are independent (the outcome of the first draw doesn’t affect the outcome of the second draw), we can calculate the probability of both events occurring by multiplying the probabilities together:\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = (3/7) * (1/2) = 3/14\nTherefore, the probability of picking a red ball and then picking a blue ball without replacement is 3/14.\nConclusion:\nAs you can see from the examples above, calculating independent events probability is not too difficult. All you need to do is understand the concept of independence and use the formula to calculate the probability of both events occurring. Practice makes perfect, so try solving more examples to strengthen your understanding. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become!\nIndependent Events Definition You are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Independent Events (wallstreetmojo.com)\nExplanation In a usual scenario, the occurrence or non-occurrence of a particular event may provide an insight into other events. However, the same is not the case in independent events, since the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event is not going to provide any idea or information about the existence of another event. Thus, the outcome of one of the events is not dependent on the outcome of another event in the same set.\nExamples of Independent Events The concept can be well understood with the help of a few examples –\nWe take two coins and then toss them. The event of the appearance of tail or head on one coin is not decisive of the appearance of tail or head on another coin. Thus, tossing two coins simultaneously or tossing the same coin twice can be said to independent events. The reason is that the probability of each outcome (i.e., head or tails) is 50% each time and is not dependent on the last toss.Similarly, when we take two dices and roll them, the resultant number on one dice does not decide the resultant number on the second dice. As a result, the rolling of two dices is another example. Rules There is a multiplication rule in probability which can be tested upon to identify whether the two events are independent or not.\nMultiplication rules state that, if two events are independent, then:\nP(A|B) = P(A)\nThis mathematical connotation denotes that two events, named A and B, are said to be independent when the probability of event A, given that event B occurs, is equal to the probability of event A. Its because, in the case of independent events, the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event doesn’t decide the occurrence or non-occurrence of another event.\nSimilarly, the following connotation also holds true.\nP(B|A) = P(B)\nIt means that if A and B are two independent events, the probability of event B, given that event A occurs, is equal to the probability of event B.\nFurther, there is one more observation that is true for such events.\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)\nThe above equation suggests that if events A and B are independent, the probability of both the events occurring is equivalent to the product of their individual probabilities.\nIndependent Events in Probability In the terminology of probability, two events can be said to independent if the outcome of one event is not decisive of the probability of occurrence or non-occurrence of another event.\nFollowing is the calculation of probability for any event –\nFor example, let us calculate the probability of getting 6 on the dice when we roll it. Here, the total number of outcomes is six (numbers 1,2,3,4,5 and 6), and a number of favorable outcomes are one (number 6). Hence, probability comes out to be 0.16.\nIndependent vs. Dependent Events Two events are said to be independent when the probability of one event does not impact the probability of another event. For example, simultaneously tossing two coins are independent events because the probability of head or tail on the first coin is not dependent or decisive of the probability of head or tail on another coin.On the other hand, two events are called dependent if the outcome of one of the events can alter the probability of another event. In simple terms, when the outcome of one event can influence the occurrence of another event, the events are said to be dependent events. For example, in a deck of 52 cards, two cards are chosen randomly one by one. Now, if the first card is chosen and it is not replaced, the probability of the second card will definitely change since after the first card is removed, only 51 cards are to remain in the deck. It results in the two events being dependent events. Conclusion For concluding whether the events are dependent or not, one needs to analyze whether the occurrence of one event may alter the probability of occurrence of the second event. One may calculate the probability of both the events and apply multiplication rules to test the independence test.\nRecommended Articles This article has been a guide to Independent Events and its definition.
