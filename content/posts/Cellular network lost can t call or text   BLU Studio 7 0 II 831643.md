## Step 1: Check the Network Coverage

Before you proceed with any troubleshooting, ensure that you are in an area that has cellular network coverage. You can do this by checking the coverage maps of your service provider. If the network is weak, move to an area with stronger coverage or wait until you are in a better location before trying to use your phone.

## Step 2: Restart Your Phone

Restarting your phone is a simple but effective solution that can resolve many issues. Press and hold the power button until the screen goes black, and the phone turns off. Wait a few seconds and then press the power button again to turn it on. Once your phone has restarted, check if the network issue has been resolved.

## Step 3: Turn Airplane Mode On and Off

Turning Airplane Mode on and off can also help you regain your cellular network connectivity. Swipe down from the top of the screen to reveal the notification panel and tap on the airplane icon to turn Airplane Mode on. Wait a few seconds, then tap on the icon again to turn it off. Once Airplane Mode is turned off, your phone should automatically reconnect to the cellular network. If not, move to the next step.

## Step 4: Reset Network Settings

Resetting network settings can resolve issues with the cellular network on your Blu Studio 7.0 II. To do this, go to Settings, then tap on Backup and Reset, and finally select Network settings reset. Tap Reset settings, and your phone will reset the network settings to their default values. After the reset, check if the issue has been resolved.

## Step 5: Contact Your Service Provider

If none of the above steps have fixed your cellular network issue, it's time to contact your service provider. They may be able to troubleshoot the problem or provide you with a solution. If the phone is still under warranty, they may replace the phone or provide repair services for free.
