Title: Think Your WiFi's Safe? Think Again! Check Out These 5 Essential Tips to Safeguard Your Wireless Network Now!

Introduction

Wireless networks are the backbone of the digital age, connecting people, devices, and businesses. However, with the increasing number of digital devices in our lives, the risk of cyberattacks has also risen. Thus, it is imperative to ensure that our wireless networks are secure. In this article, we will outline five essential tips to help you safeguard your wireless network.

1. Change the Default Login Credentials

The default login credentials that come with wireless routers, such as usernames and passwords, are often easy to guess. Changing them to a more secure username and password combination will make it harder for cybercriminals to access your network. Ensure you use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid using personal information such as birthdays, pet names, and addresses.

2. Update Your Router Firmware Regularly.

Outdated router firmware is one of the most common vulnerabilities in wireless networks. Manufacturers regularly update their firmware to patch security flaws and add new features. Updating your router firmware regularly ensures that it remains secure and up-to-date. Most modern routers have an automatic update feature that you can enable.

3. Disable Remote Management

Many routers have a remote management feature that allows you to access your network remotely. While this feature may be convenient, it is a significant security risk, as it allows hackers to access your network from anywhere in the world. Thus, it is best to disable this feature to keep your network safe.

4. Enable WPA2 Encryption

Wireless networks are vulnerable to eavesdropping, where attackers can access data transmitted over the network without authorization. Using WPA2 encryption ensures that all data transmitted over the network is secure by encrypting it. Ensure that you enable the WPA2 security protocol on your router, and use a strong password.

5. Hide Your Network Name

Most routers broadcast their network name, allowing anyone in the vicinity to see it. While this is convenient, it also makes it easy for cybercriminals to target your network. By hiding your network name (SSID), it becomes more challenging for attackers to find your network. You will need to enter the network name manually on your devices.

Conclusion

Wireless network security is vital in today's connected world. By following the above tips, you can safeguard your network and reduce the risks of cyberattacks. Remember to change your default login credentials, update your router firmware, disable remote management, enable WPA2 encryption, and hide your network name. These five essential tips will go a long way in keeping your wireless network safe. Stay secure and stay connected!

In the era of cyber-crimes and security breaches, it shouldn’t surprise you if someone has been riding your Wi-Fi for months. Considering this, if you haven’t setup any security over your Wi-Fi network yet, consider it a foremost priority.

If your wireless network is not encrypted, it may attract all freeloaders who want to leech off your internet. Here we’ve enlisted some tips for you to secure your wireless network:

## How to Secure Your Wireless Network
 
### 1.      Enable WPA2 Encryption on Your Wireless Router:
 
If you’ve been using an older wi-fi network which never gone through any maintenance, chances are you’re using an outdated Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption. WEP is prone to be hacked and isn’t considered secure anymore.

If your router doesn’t contain WPA2 security feature, you can upgrade its firmware. In case the router is too old to upgrade its firmware, you probably want to invest in buying a new Wi-Fi router. With WPS enabled, if a person can see the traffic within the range of the network, it will be all scrambled and encrypted.

### 2.      Strong and Unique Password Selection:
 
 
 
No matter how consolidated is the security, if the passphrase is a no brainer, you’re doing it wrong. A password is meant to be known just by you and must not be elementary for others to guess. Your password must a combination of alphanumerical and special characters. You must avoid passwords made up with letter continuation. For e.g. 12345678910, password, 00000, pa55word, 1111, etc. are not considered relatively safe.

### 3.      Enable Wireless Firewall:
 
Every router comes with inbuilt firewall in it. You must login to your router and enable it (Details can be found on manufacturer’s support website). Disabled firewall and public mode of Wi-Fi may open Pandora’s box for you. To double the security, experts suggest to enable the firewall on your computer and turn on the Stealth Mode to reduce the visibility of your network.

### 4.      Say No to Admin via Wireless:
 
By turning off the ‘Admin via Wireless’ feature, you cripple the hackers, as they’ll be no longer authorized to make any admin level changes if they somehow connect to your Wi-Fi network. With this feature, you can access the administrator access only if you connect using an Ethernet cable to the network. This helps prevent tampering with security and disabling the encryption by unauthorized people.

### 5.      Carefully Chose your SSID:
 
When selecting a name for your Wi-Fi, ignore putting fancy and purposeless names. An SSID must be simple and non-provoking. Names such as ‘Can’t Hack’, ‘Father of Hackers’ etc., provoke real hackers and make your Wi-Fi a soft target.

      Surprisingly, hackers have created a list that contains top 1000 common SSID’s (Wi-Fi network names). If your network name is available on that list, hackers have likely cracked your password using a Rainbow Table (aka Password Hash Table), that can be used to breach a network’s password. Unfortunately, various implantations of WPA2 may be vulnerable to this type of attacks. A prolong long password for your Wi-Fi may help in such cases.
 
      Altogether, a Wi-Fi network must be treated as your own identity. You must consider enabling required security with a cloak and dagger. The open Wi-Fi may cause an irrevocable damage. Therefore, always change your password if you had to host your guests with some data. If required, schedule a monthly maintenance visit from your network provider.
