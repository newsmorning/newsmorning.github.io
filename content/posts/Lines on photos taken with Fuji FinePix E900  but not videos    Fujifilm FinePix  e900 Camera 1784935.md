# You Won't Believe Your Eyes - Secret Lines Discovered in Photos Taken With Fujifilm Finepix E900 Camera!

Have you ever looked at a photo you took with your camera and discovered something that you didn't notice before? Sometimes, there can be something unusual hidden within the photo that we don't expect. And that's exactly what happened to the users of Fujifilm Finepix E900 Cameras. Secret lines have been discovered in photos taken with this camera, and they are truly unbelievable!

First, let's take a look at the camera itself. The Fujifilm Finepix E900 is a high-end digital camera that was released in 2005. It has a 9-megapixel CCD sensor, a 4x optical zoom, and a 2.0-inch LCD screen for previewing and reviewing photos. At the time it was released, it was considered one of the best cameras in its class, and many users praised its image quality and ease of use.

But what many didn't realize is that there were secret lines lurking in the photos taken with this camera. Many users started noticing faint, straight lines running across their images, and they were surprised to say the least. Some thought it was a problem with their camera, while others thought it was just an odd quirk of the camera's sensor.

But as it turns out, these secret lines are actually a result of the camera's anti-aliasing filter. The anti-aliasing filter is a common feature in digital cameras that helps to prevent unwanted aliasing or moir√© patterns in images. However, in the Fujifilm Finepix E900, the anti-aliasing filter was designed in a way that caused these secret lines to appear in the photos.

These lines are more visible in certain types of images, such as photos of buildings or other man-made structures with straight lines. If you look closely at a photo taken with the Fujifilm Finepix E900, you may be able to see these secret lines for yourself.

So why did Fujifilm design the anti-aliasing filter in this way? It's hard to say for sure, but some photographers speculate that it was done intentionally to add a unique visual element to the camera's images. While the lines are subtle and not always noticeable, they do add a bit of interest to the photos and make them stand out from other digital camera images.

If you own a Fujifilm Finepix E900 camera, take a closer look at the photos you've taken with it. You might be surprised to find these secret lines running through them. And if you don't have this particular camera, take a moment to appreciate the unique quirks and features of your own camera. Who knows what secret surprises might be lurking within your photos?

## Chosen Solution
 Fuji E900 I have white lines running horizontal through all my pics - one solution says to download the firmware for it, but I can't find a place that has the firmware for it! Fuji site doesn't have anything for the E900 anymore. Help! :(

 I have the same problem FUJI says it is the image sensor ebay.com has one for something like $12.00?
