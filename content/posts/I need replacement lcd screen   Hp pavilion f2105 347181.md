## Chosen Solution
 Need entire LCD assembly. Have tried everywhere I know

 In many monitors - especially older ones, the cost of the part tends to be more then a newer monitor since it can be hard to find a working used replacement. With these along with component scarcity, you also have CCFL issues with many of these displays being near the end of their life in terms of the backlight.
Your best bet is to get a modern 24” display with VGA and HDMI - HDMI can be adapted to work over DVI since it’s pin compatible without audio support.
