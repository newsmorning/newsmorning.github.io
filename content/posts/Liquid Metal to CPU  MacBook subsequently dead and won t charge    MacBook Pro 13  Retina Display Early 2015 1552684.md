Deadly Liquid Metal Shocker: MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 Won't Charge After CPU Mishap!

The MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 is one of Apple's most celebrated laptops. Packed with powerful features and sleek design, this MacBook is a favorite of professionals, students and creative folks alike. However, one mishap can turn this favorite into a nightmare; the deadly liquid metal shocker!

It's not just a little known fact that MacBook Pro power adapters, commonly referred to as "Chargers," are essential to keep the devices running. They are vital components of the device's power source and a broken charger can keep your MacBook from charging, thereby making it unusable.

When the MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 is exposed to liquid metal, specifically gallium, it can lead to some serious problems. The liquid metal can corrode and eat away at the charging port, rendering it useless.

This corrosion takes place due to the chemical reaction caused by gallium with the aluminum used in the MacBook pro. Gallium is a metal that has a low melting point and can easily turn to a liquid at room temperature.

Accidental exposure to gallium can happen while performing DIY cooling techniques where people use liquid metal as thermal compound instead of thermal paste. In some extreme cases, gallium is used to improve the cooling of the laptop's CPU and GPU, however, this comes with a deadly caveat.

If not used precisely, the liquid metal can leak onto the aluminum casing, particularly near the charging port, causing the chemical reaction described earlier. The MacBook Pro will experience severe heating up and the MacBook's charging port will become corroded, and in some cases unusable.

The MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 is not immune to the effects of liquid metal. According to reports, the device won't charge if the charging port becomes corroded due to the chemical reaction caused by gallium.

It's important to be aware of the potential hazards posed by liquid metal on your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015. Even if the damage has already occurred, there are steps you can take to avoid it in the future.

Firstly, when performing DIY cooling techniques or replacing thermal paste, ensure a clean and tight application of the liquid metal. Constant attention is required to avoid spills and ensure that the metal stays in place to do its work.

Secondly, if the damage has already occurred, it's best to consult a professional. They will inspect the damage and recommend a solution, which may include replacing the charging port or other components damaged by the liquid metal.

In conclusion, the MacBook Pro 13 Retina Display Early 2015 is a powerful device that can be rendered useless when exposed to gallium. Therefore, you should take care when performing DIY cooling techniques or upgrading your laptop's CPU or GPU. And, if you suspect liquid metal has been exposed to your device, consult a professional immediately. Remember, prevention is better than cure.

## Chosen Solution
 This isn't my first time putting liquid metal between the CPU and the heat sink. In fact, I've done it to several laptops. But this time around when I did it to this current model that I have, and it appears to have died. My guess is that a bit of the liquid metal may have gotten on the board and shorted something out. However, a detailed inspection reveals the board to be as clean as can be. I actually took it to an Apple store to see if they could investigate. They weren't able to find anything wrong and quoted me $500 to ship it off for further investigation. I'm wondering if there's any hope for it at all at this point. I don’t know if anyone has any ideas. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 You shorted the CPU out and in turn, trashed the board. You’ve treated yourself to a new board or a board-level repair (if it’s even viable) using Liquid Metal. It shouldn’t be in laptops for this exact reason. Pray the damage done to the machine isn’t fatal and beyond repair, or you get to replace the motherboard using a metal thermal paste. More then likely you’re looking at a board repair at the minimum here.
It destroys aluminum coolers and slowly corrodes copper - but it doesn’t ruin it right away. Essentially what you do when you use Liquid Metal is you are signing an early death certificate for the cooling system and you will eventually need a new heatsink every few years if you keep it long term.
This cooler damage isn’t a problem in a PC desktop where coolers are pretty universal and can (often, check on Dell/HP/Lenovo prebuilts to see if it uses standard mounting plates or a custom system that can't be replaced with off the shelf parts) be fixed when it happens in most cases.
HOWEVER, on laptops, the cooling is always custom and the damage can mean needing to spend days locating the right heatsink! Apple often uses 2 versions so unless your heatsink is still available you cannot reverse the damage without pulling one from a dead laptop with the same heatsink. I’ve also heard it ruins the CPU die given enough time as well.
It’s not a mainstream product for a reason! Stick to a good thermal paste like Artic MX-4, and let the enthusiasts with more money then brains destroy hardware. Is it really worth losing the entire system over a few extra degrees gained by risking everything?
