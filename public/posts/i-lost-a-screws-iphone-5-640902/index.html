They have different lengths and if you put in the wrong one and tighten it and can damage the motherboard. You need to buy the pack of screws and find a video or an article that tells you the length and size of the screw. I haven’t found one yet. If you can borrow a iPhone 5 from someone and compare the screws. I was looking for screws the other day because I was changing the screen on iPhone xs max and someone didn’t put the cover and screws in for the screen and battery. I found the cover and had it sent from China but I couldn’t find the screws and bought them for an iPhone X and will have to figure out which screws will work. I hope this helps you.\n","wordCount":"578","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Grant Bennett"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/i-lost-a-screws-iphone-5-640902/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>I Lost A Screw From My iPhone 5 and You Won't Believe What Happened Next!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 15, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;578 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Grant Bennett</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=i-lost-a-screw-from-my-iphone-5-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next>I Lost A Screw From My iPhone 5 and You Won&rsquo;t Believe What Happened Next!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#i-lost-a-screw-from-my-iphone-5-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next>#</a></h1><p>It was just another ordinary day for me until I noticed that one of the tiny screws from my iPhone 5 had gone missing.
