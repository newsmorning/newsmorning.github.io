After all, Crosley CR704 CD players come with a range of features that make them sought after, including playing vinyl records, cassette tapes, and CDs. Plus, they have an appealing vintage design that adds a touch of style to any room. So, what can you do if your Crosley CR704 CD player stops working? Keep reading to find out.

Section 1: Diagnosing the Problem
The first step to fixing your Crosley CR704 CD player is to diagnose the problem. Start by checking all cables and connections to see if they are loose or disconnected. The next step is to clean the CD player's laser lens using a soft clean cloth or CD laser lens cleaner. Before you start cleaning, make sure the CD player is unplugged from any power source. Finally, check if the CD player is stuck or jammed. It is not uncommon for a CD player to malfunction due to a stuck or jammed CD.

Section 2: Taking the CD Player apart
If you have attempted steps one to three and the CD player still won't work, you may need to take it apart. Before you do this, we recommend that you check your warranty and manufacturer's instructions. If your warranty is still valid, seek professional help instead. If your warranty has expired, it's time to take the CD player apart.

Section 3: The Inner Workings of Your Crosley CR704 CD player
First, you need to locate the screws that hold the CD player together. These screws are usually hiding behind labels, rubber pads, or other parts. Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the screws carefully. Once you have removed the screws, you can then take the CD player apart. Inside, you'll see wires, gears, and a motor. Check each one for visible signs of damage, such as wear and tear or broken connections. If you find any worn out or broken parts, take a picture of them and look for replacement parts.

Section 4: Reassembling the CD Player
Once you have replaced any worn out or broken parts, reassemble the CD player. Make sure that all parts are properly secured and that the CD player works correctly. If the CD player still doesn't work, it's time to accept that it is beyond repair. However, if it does work, you've saved yourself money by not having to replace a perfectly useful item.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, fixing your Crosley CR704 CD player requires a bit of patience, troubleshooting techniques, and careful disassembly to diagnose and address the problem. Always start by checking the cables and connections, laser lens, and for any jammed CDs. If all of these attempts fall short, it's time to get your hands dirty and disassemble the CD player. Remember that if your warranty is still valid, you should always seek professional technical help. With a bit of perseverance, your Crosley CR704 CD player will be back to playing your favorite tunes like new again.

## Chosen Solution
 So I put the CD in and it thinks then displays the number of songs. Sometimes when I press play the light lights up but only after pressing it several times and pressing skip so the display says it’s on the first track. Then it thinks for a second and the disk sounds like it is turning and then the displays says “E” and I’m not sure what to do after that. I don’t think it could get dust in it so I don’t think that’s the problem.

 Hi @isabel18,
Have you tried another CD just in case the CD is faulty, you didn't say?
Try cleaning the laser lens (example only) and check if that resolves the problem. You would be surprised how dust gets in to cover the lens. Dust on a CD can take it in and then it is blown onto the lens by the movement of the disc and over time it builds up. Unless you clean the disc every time that is ;-)
