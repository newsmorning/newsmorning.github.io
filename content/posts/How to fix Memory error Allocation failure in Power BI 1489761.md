# Crash-proof Your Power BI and Say Goodbye to Memory Errors with This One Simple Fix!



Are you tired of Power BI crashing when you’re trying to work on a big report? Have you ever been frustrated by a memory error that shows up out of nowhere? Don’t worry – you’re not alone.

Many Power BI users experience similar issues, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex reports. Fortunately, there is a simple fix that can help you avoid these problems and keep Power BI running smoothly.

In this article, we’ll show you how to crash-proof your Power BI and prevent memory errors by optimizing your report design and modifying your workspace settings.

## Understanding Memory Errors

Before we jump into the solution, let’s take a closer look at what causes memory errors in Power BI. When you work on a report, Power BI stores a large amount of information in your computer’s memory.

If your report is too complex or your computer’s memory is too limited, Power BI may not be able to store all of the data in memory. When this happens, Power BI crashes or generates a memory error message.

## Optimizing Your Report Design

One way to avoid memory errors and prevent Power BI crashes is to optimize your report design. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

- **Simplify your visuals:** Use simple visuals that convey the message clearly without too much clutter. Eliminate redundant data or unnecessary elements that don't contribute to the report’s goals.
- **Reduce the number of visuals in a single report:** Power BI uses a lot of memory to display visuals. Combining multiple visuals into one can help reduce the amount of memory used.
- **Minimize data size:** Remove any unnecessary columns or rows that aren’t needed in your report. This can reduce the amount of data stored in memory and prevent memory errors.
- **Use summarized data:** When possible, summarize data instead of using detailed information. For example, instead of using a table with thousands of rows, you can group the data by category and create a bar or column chart.

## Modifying Workspace Settings

Another way to reduce the risk of memory errors and ensure a smooth Power BI experience is to modify your workspace settings. Here are a few settings you can adjust:

- **Increase the size of your page file:** By default, Windows allocates a certain amount of space on your hard drive for virtual memory – also known as the page file. If Power BI runs out of physical memory, it will use the page file to store data. You can increase the page file size to give Power BI more space to work with.
- **Lower visual rendering limits:** Power BI lets you set a limit on how many visuals can be rendered at once. You can adjust this setting to ensure that only the visuals you need are loaded into memory.
- **Disable automatic page refresh:** By default, Power BI automatically refreshes your report every few minutes. If your report is especially large or complex, this can cause memory errors. You can disable automatic refresh and manually refresh the report whenever needed.

## Conclusion

If you’re tired of Power BI crashes and memory errors, there is hope. By optimizing your report design and modifying your workspace settings, you can keep Power BI running smoothly and avoid these frustrating issues.

Remember to simplify your visuals, reduce the number of visuals in a single report, minimize data size, and use summarized data. You can also adjust your workspace settings like increasing the size of your page file, lowering visual rendering limits, and disabling automatic page refresh. With these simple changes, you can crash-proof your Power BI and never worry about memory errors again!

Power BI is a fantastic tool from Microsoft, and while it may not be the stablest software tool of its kind, it’s admittedly still new and under active development.
 
- Users have reported that they can't use PowerBI because of a Memory error allocation failure error.This is usually caused by insufficient memory on the hardware's behalf to process the given tasks.You can go ahead and increase the available memory, which also works on virtual machines.Additionally, you can try removing unused columns to make page processing easier.

The memory allocation failure error in Power BI usually occurs if the system does not have enough memory to process the task at hand.
 
You can try to close some apps, allocate more memory or make edits to the original table to fix this error as reported by the users in the Power BI Community.
 
Follow the troubleshooting tips in this article to fix Power BI allocation failure error.
 
HiI have created a pbix file in 64bit machine. File Size: 22 MB. Rows: 5.5 Million Approx.Data is fetched from MYSQL Database.While I try to open the same file in a 32-bit machine, an error message pops up“Failed to save Modification to the server. Error returned: Memory Error : Allocation Faliure. If you are using 32 bit version of the product,consider upgrading to the 64 bit version or increasing the amount of memory available on the machine”.
 
Quick Tip:
 
You may adjust your browser to control how much of your PC’s resources are consumed while streaming, playing games, or downloading files.
 
Opera GX is one such browser that provides the GX Control Panel, which allows you to set limits on network bandwidth, RAM, and CPU use while navigating on it.
 
## Not enough memory error in Power BI
 
### 1. Increase the memory available on the Machine
 
- If you are using the service on a Virtual Machine, check if the allocated memory is enough for the operations.
 - Since you are getting this error, try to allocate more memory to the machine.
 - You can also try to better utilize the available memory by optimizing your data model.
 - You can check the Internet for guides on optimizing your data model.

 
### 2. Enable Windows page file
 
- The error can also occur if your system has Windows Page File disabled.
 - Login with the Administrator account to your system.
 - Press Windows Key + R to open Run.
 - Type control and click OK to open the Control Panel.
 - Click on System and Security.
 - Click on System.
 - From the left pane of the System window, click on Advanced System Settings.
 - By default, you should be in the Advanced tab.
 - From the Advanced tab, click on the Settings button under the Performance section.
 - Open the Advanced tab in the Performance Options window.
 - Click the Change button under Virtual Memory section.
 - Make sure Automatically manage paging file size for all drives option is checked.
 - Click OK to save the changes.
 - Restart the computer and check if the memory allocation failure error.

 
### 3. Other solutions to try
 
- Try to remove any unnecessary column in Edit Queries before importing in the data model.
 - While Power BI supports 2bn rows and 16,000 columns, it can be limited by the machine performance.
 - Try to allocate more memory in the Data Load tab. From Power BI dashboard, open Option > Data Load.
 - Now increase the maximum allowed memory.
 - If you using 32-bit Excel app, I would recommend you to use 64-bit Excel which should overcome any memory limitation issues.
 - Memory issues can also be caused by too many columns and bad cells, but thankfully enough these can be fixed.
