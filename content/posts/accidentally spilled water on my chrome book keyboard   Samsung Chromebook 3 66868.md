Accidentally spilling water on your beloved laptop can be a nightmare. Especially if you have a Samsung Chromebook 3, which is not only the perfect balance between portability and functionality but also comes at an affordable price. However, just like any other electronic device, it's not water-resistant, which makes it vulnerable to liquid spills. But what happens when you accidentally spill water on the keyboard of your Samsung Chromebook 3? Did I just ruin my laptop, or was there some hope left? 

Here's what happened to me when I accidentally spilled water on my Samsung Chromebook 3 keyboard.

## The Spill

It was a typical Monday morning when I was working on my Samsung Chromebook 3. I was sipping coffee, and before I knew it, the cup slid off my desk and landed directly on my laptop's keyboard. The moment felt like an eternity, but in reality, it was just a few seconds. I quickly grabbed a towel and tried to remove the water from the keyboard. I immediately shut down my laptop and looked for solutions online.

## The Solution

The first thing I did was to find a comprehensive guide on how to save my laptop from water damage. Most of the guides suggested leaving the laptop to dry for at least 48 hours, which seemed like eternity to me.

Luckily, I found a unique solution that helped me save my laptop far more quickly than 48 hours. I grabbed some tissue, removed the excess water, and flipped the laptop upside down. I let the water drain out, away from the keyboard, and kept it in an inverted position for an hour, allowing the remaining water to evaporate. 

After an hour, I flipped the Chromebook back to its standard position and used a hairdryer (on cool settings) to make sure everything was dried thoroughly.

## The Outcome

I switched the Chromebook power on, and it was running like usual. However, I noticed that a few keys on the keyboard were sticky and not functioning correctly. Therefore, I removed the keys and cleaned the stems underneath them. After that, all the keys were working correctly, and my Samsung Chromebook 3 was back to its original function.

## Conclusion

It's never a good idea to spill water on your laptop, but if it does happen, all hope is not lost. If you follow the steps mentioned in this article, there is a good chance that you can save your laptop from water damage. However, prevention is always better than cure.

It's a good idea to invest in a waterproof case, protective keyboard cover or simply keep your drinks away from your laptop. A little extra care and attention to your Samsung Chromebook 3 can ensure its longevity and prevent accidental spills from turning into a significant problem.

It's always better to be safe than sorry. But if you ever do find yourself in this situation, follow the steps mentioned above, and you might just be able to save your beloved Samsung Chromebook 3.

## Chosen Solution
 so i spilled water on my keyboard and now when i type something  the letter “H” keeps popping up if my finger even slightly touches . the letter H is the only key giving me problems, is there a way to fix this ?

 @winmathers
this sounds like a shortened out keyboard. The only way to fix this would be by replacing it Problem is that there are not to many disassembly instructions and only a few places with replacement keyboards. The few I found are all complete with palmrest assembly. Check this video "and see if you can get to your keyboard like this. Otherwise just get a USB keyboard for now until there are better instructions and parts easier available
