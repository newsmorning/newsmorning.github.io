Main Body:

Mickey and Friends:

Let's start with the most iconic Disney characters, Mickey, and his friends. Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Donald, and Goofy are all part of the Speedstorm lineup, and together they bring in the perfect blend of classic Disney charm and racing thrills. Each character comes with their unique power-up abilities, making them stand out from each other. For example, Mickey can use his wizard hat to summon a magical whirlwind that can clear opponents from his way, while Minnie can cast a love spell that will slow down her opponents.

The Incredibles:

Next on the lineup, we have the superhero family, The Incredibles. Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet, and Dash, all come with their unique powers that can be used to your racing advantage. For example, Dash can use his super-speed ability to boost his car faster, while Violet can create a protective force-field that can block incoming attacks.

Toy Story:

Who can forget the lovable gang from Toy Story? Woody, Buzz, and Bo Peep bring in the same level of excitement and humor to the Speedstorm. Woody can use his cowboy lasso to hook onto opponents' cars, while Buzz uses his laser beam to blast them out of his way. Bo Peep, on the other hand, can summon her sheep for an adorable and effective blockade.

Frozen:

The Snow Queen Elsa, cheerful Anna, and the lovable snowman, Olaf, are ready to face the racing challenges in Arendelle. Each character has unique powers, with Elsa able to summon ice shards to immobilize her opponents, Anna can use her warm hugs to accelerate her car, and Olaf can create slippery ice trails that will slow down the competition.

Conclusion:
