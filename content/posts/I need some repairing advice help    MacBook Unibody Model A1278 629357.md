## Chosen Solution
 I am having trouble figuring out how to repair this MacBook 2008 Apple Macbook A1278 I have gotten from a friend. It was "hollowed/gutted" but I have some parts to it. My idea was finding another macbook same version to put the parts into the broken one. I am trying to revive this broken macbook because it has some things on it that I need, but can't do that if it doesn't work.
Here are some photos: (Screen is cracked and will not display)









Any help is appreciated.

 Ashton, only you know what you have in your possession. Look through these guides and check the parts you have. You do not need to piece this together for "it has some things on it that I need" There are other means to access you hard drive, which is the only place your computer stores information.   Getting an external USB hard drive enclosure that will allow you to access your drive on a different computer would be one way.

 The LCD replacement will be costly.
Beside Apple doesn't sell you internal parts, I've checked.
Just open the bottom side out using a small screwdriver & then remove the harddrive.

 You can always buy Apple, but you CAN NOT buy parts that are inside.
Many fools love to buy Apple, but when it breaks.  You are out of luck because only they repair it and charge you dearly or forced to buy a newer model.
