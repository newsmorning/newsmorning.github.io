# You'll Never Believe How Easy It Is to Remove Retail Mode from Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic!

Are you tired of constantly seeing pop-up ads and warnings every time you try to use your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic? If so, you may be dealing with the "Retail Mode" feature, which is a mode that is primarily used by retailers to showcase the device's features to potential customers. But don't worry, removing this feature is easier than you think!

## Step 1: Enter the Retail Mode Code

To get started, you'll need to enter the code that's associated with the Retail Mode. This code is usually provided to the retailer when they receive the device. If you don't have this code, you can try searching for it online or contact Samsung's customer service for assistance.

Here's how to enter the Retail Mode code:

1. Go to the Settings app on your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.
2. Scroll down and tap on "About Watch."
3. Tap on "Software."
4. Tap on "Build Number" multiple times until it says "You are now a developer."
5. Go back to the main Settings page and scroll down to "Developer Options."
6. Tap on "Demo Mode."
7. Enter the Retail Mode code.

## Step 2: Disable Demo Mode

After entering the Retail Mode code, you'll need to disable Demo Mode. This will remove all of the pop-up ads and warnings associated with Retail Mode.

Here's how to disable Demo Mode:

1. Go to the home screen on your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.
2. Swipe down from the top of the screen to access the quick settings menu.
3. Tap on the "Settings" icon.
4. Scroll down and tap on "Accessibility."
5. Tap on "Vision."
6. Scroll down and tap on "Screen Reader."
7. Toggle off the "Screen Reader" switch.
8. Restart your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.

## Step 3: Remove Retail Mode Apps

Lastly, you'll need to remove any Retail Mode apps that were installed on your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. These apps are often pre-installed and cannot be removed until you disable Retail Mode and Demo Mode.

Here's how to remove Retail Mode apps:

1. Go to the home screen on your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.
2. Press and hold on the app you want to remove.
3. Tap on "Uninstall."
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for any remaining Retail Mode apps.

Congratulations, you have successfully removed Retail Mode from your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic!

## Conclusion

Removing Retail Mode from your Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is a simple process that can make your user experience much more enjoyable. By entering the Retail Mode code, disabling Demo Mode, and removing Retail Mode apps, you'll be able to use your smartwatch without any unwanted interruptions.
