1. DIY Wooden Crate Cover

This DIY wooden crate cover is an affordable and straightforward cover hack that will give your turntable an effortlessly rustic look. You can use scraps of wood and other materials like screws, nails, and sandpaper to create a unique design to suit your taste. It's an excellent way to repurpose old items and turn them into something new and artistic.

2. Leather Cover

A leather cover adds a sophisticated touch to your Jensen JTA 222 turntable. To achieve this cover hack, make sure to measure your turntable and create a pattern. Once you have your pattern, you can cut out your leather pieces and sew them together. If you don't want to go through the process of stitching, there are leather adhesive products in the market that you can use to glue the leather pieces together.

3. Crochet Cover

A crochet cover is a creative and unique cover hack that allows you to display your crochet mastery. To make a crochet cover, you'll need crochet hooks, yarn, and your imagination. You can play with colors and mix and match patterns to make a beautiful and intricate cover. The great thing about this is that you can take it off and wash it when needed.

4. Book Cover

A book cover is an excellent cover hack for those who love to read and listen to music. You can use an old book whose cover suits your style or choose one that complements your room's decor. Once you have your book, cut out a space for your turntable to fit in and attach the cover to your turntable's base.

5. Denim Cover

Upcycling old jeans into a denim cover is a trendy, eco-friendly cover hack. Cut the jeans in the appropriate places, sew them together, and add a few decorative elements if you want. The result is a unique and sturdy cover that protects your turntable from dust and scratches.

6. Glass Cover

A glass cover adds a modern and sleek look to your Jensen JTA 222 turntable. You can purchase a pre-made glass cover that fits your turntable or have a professional cut one for you. A glass cover not only looks great, but it also protects your turntable from dust and other elements that can damage it.

A pallet wood cover is an inexpensive and straightforward cover hack that adds a rustic feel to your turntable. All you need are pallets or other wooden planks, a saw, hammer, and nails. Cut the planks to size and nail them together to create the cover. You can also sand and paint the cover to enhance its look.
