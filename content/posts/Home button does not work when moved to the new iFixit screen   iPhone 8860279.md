# You Won't Believe What Happens When You Replace Your iPhone 8 Screen - Home Button Malfunction Revealed!

If the screen of your iPhone 8 has been damaged or cracked, you might be contemplating replacing it with a new screen. But before you go ahead, there's something you need to know about the home button function.

Replacing the screens of iPhones has become increasingly popular, with many people opting to fix their broken screens at home rather than pay for professional repairs. However, what many people don't know is that replacing the screen on your iPhone 8 may result in the malfunctioning of your home button.

The reasoning behind this is that the home button on the iPhone 8 is part of Apple's Touch ID security system. The Touch ID security system is essentially a fingerprint scanner that allows the user to unlock their phone and make purchases using fingerprint recognition. This system is connected to the motherboard of the iPhone, and when the screen is replaced, it may disrupt the connection between the home button and the motherboard. 

The result of this disruption can be that the home button no longer functions, or it works intermittently. This can be a frustrating issue for iPhone 8 users, and it may also compromise the security of their phone.

One way to fix this problem is by going to an authorized Apple repair center to replace your screen. Apple repair staff are highly trained, and they know how to replace the screen without disrupting the home button's connection to the motherboard. This is the safest and most reliable option for those who want to repair their iPhone 8 screen and ensure that their home button works correctly.

However, if someone is determined to fix their iPhone 8 screen at home, there are a few things they can try to avoid the home button malfunction issue. Firstly, they can try to reconnect the home button by carefully removing and then reattaching the home button flex cable.

Another option is to get a screen that has Touch ID's functionality built into it. However, it's worth noting that these types of screens can be expensive, and they do not offer the same level of security as Apple's official Touch ID system.

In conclusion, while replacing the screen on an iPhone 8 might seem like a straightforward procedure, it can result in the malfunctioning of the home button. To avoid this issue, it's best to go to an authorized Apple repair center to get a screen replacement. However, if someone is determined to fix their screen at home, they can try to reconnect the home button or invest in a screen with built-in Touch ID functionality.

## Chosen Solution
 I have completed the install of a new screen for my iPhone 8 but after transferring the home button from the old screen to the new one it is no longer recognized (as in it doesn't function at all, not as a button and not for Touch ID).  To test, I put it back in the old screen and reassembled the iPhone 8 and the button worked fine again (haptic response and touch id) but after moving it back to the new iFixit screen and reassembling the iPhone the button stops working (no haptic response, no touch id, no response from iphone).
Is there some extra step I should be doing?  I have already reinstalled ios after factory defaulting it.  I also tried putting it into DFU mode and reinstalling ios but it didn't make any difference

 The new screen has a torn cable somewhere, replace it.

 New replacement screens are crap quality, itâ€™s like a lottery getting a decent one. Contact ifixit and ask for a replacement. Hopefully the new one will work.
