**New York, NY** - It was a typical day when my good friend, Susan, dropped by for coffee. As we sat at my kitchen table chatting, she accidentally spilled her cup of coffee all over my MacBook Pro. Panic set in as I quickly tried to dry it off, but it was too late; the damage was done.

As a writer, my MacBook was my life. I relied on it for everything, from work to entertainment, and just like that, it was gone. I took it to the Apple Store, and they confirmed my worst fears. The logic board was damaged beyond repair, and fixing it would cost me a small fortune.

As I sat there, feeling completely helpless, I stumbled upon a Youtube video claiming to have a solution for my problem. It was a video about how to clean and fix a liquid-damaged MacBook, and I couldn't believe what I was watching.

The video showed a man disassembling a MacBook that had been submerged in water. It looked hopeless, but as he went through the process, he meticulously cleaned every component of the MacBook. Eventually, the MacBook was reassembled, and to everyone's amazement, it worked perfectly.

Feeling desperate, I followed the steps in the video and cleaned my MacBook as thoroughly as I could. To my surprise, it actually turned on, but as it tries to boot, a strange noise comes out from its speakers.

I thought I had ruined it even further, but as I continued to watch the Youtube video, the man recommended leaving the MacBook on its side to dry out for a few days. I decided to give it a try and left my MacBook on its side for three days.

On the fourth day, I nervously hit the power button, and to my absolute amazement, my MacBook worked like nothing had ever happened. It was as if I had just bought it from the store. I couldn't believe my luck.

In the end, I learned a very valuable lesson. Accidents happen, and it's essential to know that there are ways to fix them. Trusting the skills and knowledge of others can be a lifesaver in times of need. And who knows, you may even discover a Youtube video that can save your most valuable possession.

## Chosen Solution
 Okay, so back in May, I spilled water on my MacBook Air (it was water from my Reverse Osmosis system if that helps).
It did turn off, but I was so worried that it wouldn’t turn on again that I tried turning it on, and it did actually power on. However, the display started flickering and eventually went so dim that you needed a flashlight pointed at the Apple logo on the back to see it.
The keyboard and trackpad did work for a little bit after the spill, but then they both stopped working (haven’t tried in Linux or Windows yet, however), and the KB backlight works. IDK if this is useful or not, but the caps lock light stays on all the time.
Another thing that happened was that the MagSafe light would stay orange, even without the battery, and with the battery in, it wouldn’t actually charge and the OS said that the battery needed to be replaced. Based on the MagSafe light, and the fact that the battery percentage still goes down sometimes, I can almost confirm that it’s the logic board.
Do these all sound like logic-board-related problems? Thanks!
EDIT: I added the coconut battery image, it looks like the battery is still in good condition, it might just be that the SMC is all messed up.

 Let’s get a better view of things, install this gem of an app! CoconutBattery take a snapshot of the apps main window and post it here for us to see Adding images to an existing question
Given What you've stated you likely have some corrosion. Reverse Osmosis systems brine tank uses salt so the water within it is quite salty making it highly corrosive.  Here's a good writeup on the process What is Reverse Osmosis? The effectiveness of the given system might still leave a bit of salt in the drinking water.
Basically, you'll need to fully remove the logic board and make a detailed inspection of it to see how badly it's damaged.
But I would first get the battery checked as there is a point the costs are more expensive than replacing the system.
