If you own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, you might have experienced a problem with your screen going haywire. This issue has been reported by many users, and it can be frustrating to deal with.

So, what causes this problem? And what can you do to fix it?

The main cause of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 screen going haywire is a software issue. Specifically, it's often caused by a glitch in the tablet's operating system.

Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to fix this issue.

First, try rebooting your Galaxy Tab 4. This can sometimes solve the problem, especially if it's a temporary glitch. To do this, simply press and hold the Power button until the tablet turns off, and then turn it back on again.

If that doesn't work, try clearing the cache partition. This is a simple process that can help clear any temporary files that might be causing the problem. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Turn off your Galaxy Tab 4.
2. Press and hold the Volume Up, Power, and Home buttons simultaneously.
3. When the Samsung logo appears, release the Power button, but keep holding the other two buttons.
4. When the Android logo appears, release all three buttons.
5. Use the Volume buttons to navigate to the "wipe cache partition" option, and then press the Power button to select it.
6. When the process is complete, use the Volume buttons to navigate to the "reboot system now" option, and then press the Power button to select it.

If neither of these steps works, you may need to do a factory reset. This will erase all of your data, so make sure you back up everything before proceeding. To do a factory reset, follow these steps:

1. Turn off your Galaxy Tab 4.
2. Press and hold the Volume Up, Power, and Home buttons simultaneously.
3. When the Samsung logo appears, release the Power button, but keep holding the other two buttons.
4. When the Android logo appears, release all three buttons.
5. Use the Volume buttons to navigate to the "wipe data/factory reset" option, and then press the Power button to select it.
6. Use the Volume buttons to navigate to the "Yes -- delete all user data" option, and then press the Power button to select it.
7. When the process is complete, use the Volume buttons to navigate to the "reboot system now" option, and then press the Power button to select it.

If none of these steps work, you may need to contact Samsung for further assistance. They may be able to diagnose the problem and offer a solution.

In conclusion, if your Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 screen goes haywire, don't panic. Try rebooting the tablet, clearing the cache partition, or doing a factory reset. If none of these steps work, contact Samsung for further assistance. With a little patience, you can get your tablet working properly again in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I got the screen replaced in led as it was badly cracked. Everything was brand new until Out of nowhere it has lines all down the screen making the screen unusable. Its not cracked. Whats my problem and how much will it cost to be fixed??

 @melissandarling this sounds like a bad LCD.I'd take it back to where you got it fixed (if it was recent) and have them replace it again. If you cannot do that you'll have to replace it yourself. The LCD can be had anywhere from $60-$100USD and up. This video should get you there.
