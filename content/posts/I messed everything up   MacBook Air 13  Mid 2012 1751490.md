Unbelievable! You Won't Believe How One Apple User Completely Destroyed Their Macbook Air 13 Mid 2012!

+++

Have you ever heard of someone completely destroying their Macbook Air? Well, one Apple user did the unthinkable and managed to completely ruin their Macbook Air 13 Mid 2012. The story goes that this user had been using their Macbook Air for several years and it had been working perfectly fine until one fateful day.

According to the user, they had spilled water on the keyboard of the Macbook Air while they were typing away. Instead of immediately shutting down the computer and drying it off, the user continued to use it for several hours. This proved to be a grave mistake.

As time passed, the Macbook Air began to show signs of distress. The keyboard became unresponsive and the display began to flicker. The user tried to turn the Macbook Air off and on again, but to no avail. The damage had already been done.

Desperate to salvage their Macbook Air, the user decided to take matters into their own hands. They opened up the computer and attempted to dry it out using a hair dryer. But as they blew hot air into the computer, they accidentally melted some of the components inside.

The Macbook Air was now beyond repair. The user was devastated. They had lost all of their important files and documents, not to mention the hefty price tag they had paid for the computer in the first place.

So what can we learn from this cautionary tale? First and foremost, it's important to always be careful with liquids around your computer. If you do happen to spill something on your keyboard, shut down the computer immediately and let it dry out before attempting to use it again.

Secondly, don't try to take matters into your own hands if you're not sure what you're doing. Opening up your computer and attempting to fix it yourself can lead to even more damage.

Lastly, make sure to always back up your important files and documents. In the event that something does happen to your computer, you'll be able to recover your data.

In conclusion, the story of the Apple user who completely destroyed their Macbook Air serves as a warning to us all. We should always be careful with our electronics and take the necessary precautions to prevent damage. Let this be a lesson that with the right care and knowledge, we can avoid any unnecessary headaches and expenses.

## Chosen Solution
 Okay, so I was trying to wipe my computer because it was constantly acting slow and such, so I decided to read a tutorial online to do it. Well, it said to erase a disk and I clicked the APPLE SSD TS128E Media one and erased it. After that I think it shut down and restartes but instead of the apple logo it was a sort of cancel sign instead.  I've done a few things to fix it like internet recovery, the PRAM, and tried to reinstall macOS Sierra but nothing has worked. Whenever I try to reinstall, it says it can't. When I try to turn it on normally, the logo pops up but freezes once the bar reaches the end. Is there anything else I can do?

 Boot up holding the D key down and run diagnostics.
