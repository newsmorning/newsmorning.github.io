## Chosen Solution
 Hello.  This is possibly caused by drop damage as the corners of the machine are a little banged up.
The machine will turn on (CPU is warm, caps lock lights up, touch pad click) and you can also hear the charging “chime” when plugged in and it takes 20v and 2.5A through the charger.
But the touch bar and LCD screen remain black with no image and no backlight.
I have tried a USB-C to HDMI cable and also get no display, but I am not certain that the display would show automatically.
Also tried SMC and PRAM reset.
Unfortunately I don’t have another LCD to try.
Logic board looks spotless with no liquid damage.
Any tips?

 After starting the system with the external display plugged in and using a USB or bluetooth keyboard and mouse close the lid the system should realize the external is the primary display at that point and will turn it on. Do you see your desktop and icons on it?
If not then your logic board has a major failure and its also possible the display and Touch Bar are also damaged.
