Title: MacBook Battery Swap Gone Wrong: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Retina Display All Failing After DIY Repair!

Introduction:

MacBook owners often face the dilemma of whether to repair or replace their device when the battery starts to deteriorate. While some choose to take it to an authorized dealer, others choose to do it themselves with the help of repair kits widely available on the internet. However, it is essential to understand that doing a MacBook battery swap by yourself can result in significant risks, as there is a likelihood of damaging other components.

Body:

Recently, there have been reports of MacBook owners encountering issues after a DIY battery repair. One such issue is the failure of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, which can be very frustrating, especially for those who rely on their devices for work or communication. The root cause of the problem is the inadvertent damage caused to the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennas during the battery replacement process. 

Another significant issue that surfaces due to DIY battery replacement is related to the device's retina display. In some instances, the display may flicker, become unresponsive, or even fail to turn on after a DIY repair. This could be due to damage caused to the display cable or the backlight cable during the replacement process. 

It is vital to understand that MacBook devices are complex machines, and any repair or replacement needs to be carried out with precision and care. Any errors, no matter how minor they may seem, can result in significant damage to the device's core components, such as the motherboard, processor, or RAM. Furthermore, any damage caused during the repair process may not be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. 

Conclusion:

In conclusion, while a DIY battery replacement may seem like a cost-effective option for MacBook owners, the risks far outweigh the benefits. It is always advisable to seek professional help when it comes to any repairs or replacements for your MacBook device, especially those that involve major components like the battery. By doing so, you can avoid the frustration of dealing with multiple issues, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth failure, and having to pay for costly repairs to fix them.

## Chosen Solution
 I used the iFixit instructions to change the battery on my early 2016 MacBook and when I got it started again the computer can no longer recognize the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth hardware. I took it to a repair person and they said it must be the logic board. Does anyone know how this couldâ€™ve happened? Or if possibly it is something else? Thank you.

 More likely you forgot to connect the antenna cables. Review Steps 28 & 29

They may have gotten stuck underneath the logic board when you put the board back.
