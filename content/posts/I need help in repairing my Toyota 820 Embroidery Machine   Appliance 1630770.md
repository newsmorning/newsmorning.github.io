# Embroidery Machine Disaster: Desperate Toyota Owner Seeks Help for DIY Repair!

Embroidery machines have changed the face of fashion and DIY crafts. They can help you stitch beautiful patterns and designs on almost everything - from purses and wall hangings to garments and home d√©cor. However, like any machine, they can break down unexpectedly, leaving you clueless about what went wrong.

If you own a Toyota embroidery machine, chances are you love the quality of stitches and user-friendliness it offers. But what happens when it breaks down in the middle of an important project? Do you take it to a repair shop, or do you attempt a DIY fix?

Unfortunately, many Toyota embroidery machine owners find themselves in a similar predicament. They try to troubleshoot the problem on their own, but often end up causing even more damage. In this article, we'll discuss one such incident and how the owner sought help for a DIY repair.

## The Disaster Strikes

It was a fine Wednesday evening, and Sarah was excited to work on her latest embroidery project - a beautiful bouquet of wildflowers on a linen tablecloth. She turned on her Toyota embroidery machine, loaded the design, and started stitching.

However, after a few minutes, the machine suddenly stopped. Sarah checked the thread tension, the bobbin, and everything else she could think of, but to no avail. The machine remained unresponsive.

Panicking, Sarah searched online for solutions but got lost in a sea of technical jargon and complex instructions. Defeated, she sighed and packed up her project for the night.

## The Search for Help

The next day, Sarah paid a visit to the local repair shop to get her Toyota embroidery machine fixed. However, upon receiving the repair estimate, she was devastated. The cost was way too high, and she didn't have the funds to spare.

Determined not to give up on her machine, Sarah turned to social media for help. She posted her problem on several embroidery groups and forums, hoping to find someone who could guide her through a DIY repair.

## The DIY Fix

Luckily, Sarah's call for help didn't go unheard. A fellow Toyota embroidery machine owner, who had experienced a similar problem before, reached out to her. He explained that the issue was likely caused by a loose connection in the electronic components, and that he could guide her through the entire repair process.

Over the next few days, Sarah followed his instructions and successfully fixed her embroidery machine. She was elated that she didn't have to spend a fortune on repairs or purchase a new machine. Even better, she made a new friend and felt more confident in her ability to tackle machine breakdowns in the future.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, owning a Toyota embroidery machine is a joy, but it can be frustrating when it stops working unexpectedly. As Sarah learned, seeking help from fellow machine owners who have experienced similar issues can be a great way to troubleshoot and fix the problem on your own. However, it's essential to exercise caution and avoid DIY repairs that could further damage the machine. When in doubt, seek professional help to avoid a costly mistake.

## Chosen Solution
 I am receiving a motor lock error on my machine. The fly wheel turns freely and I purchased a new power supply.  I wonder if the problem is software and hardware related because I am using the original Pantogram software and have made a number of modification to make the new computers compatible.  I bought a second used machine and I am getting the same error message on that machine. Does anyone have a repair manual?

 If you see the error"Sewing motor lock", it is likely that your power supply has failed. When you see the error message "Sewing motor lock" this DOES NOT mean your sewing motor is frozen. It means the motor is not getting the correct voltage from the power supply in almost every case.  
So I guess you should replace your power unit.
