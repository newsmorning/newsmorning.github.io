The morning started off like any other. We arrived at the office, grabbed a cup of coffee, and settled into our desks. But as we went to start up our Acer desktop computer, we found ourselves facing an unexpected problem.

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) failed to start, leaving us scratching our heads and wondering what could have gone wrong. After some investigation, we discovered that there were a few common reasons why a CPU might fail to start.

One of the most common causes is a problem with the power supply. In some cases, the power supply may not be providing enough power to start the computer, or it may be damaged or faulty. Another possible cause is a problem with the motherboard or the CPU itself, which can prevent the system from starting up properly.

After checking the power supply and motherboard, we determined that the issue was related to the CPU. Specifically, the heat sink and fan had become clogged with dust and debris, causing the CPU to overheat and fail to start.

Determined to get the computer up and running again, we set about cleaning the heat sink and fan. First, we shut down and unplugged the computer, then opened the case to access the CPU. Using a can of compressed air and a soft brush, we carefully removed the debris and dust from the heat sink and fan.

After reassembling the computer and restarting it, we were relieved to find that the CPU had started up without issue. It was a promising sign that our efforts to resolve the problem had been successful.

So what did we learn from this experience? First and foremost, it's important to keep your computer clean and properly maintained to prevent issues like this from arising. Regularly cleaning the heat sink and fan can go a long way in preventing CPU overheating and failure.

Additionally, it's always a good idea to run diagnostic software regularly to detect any issues with your computer's hardware. This can help identify and resolve problems early on, before they become more serious and potentially damaging.

In conclusion, while we were initially stumped by the CPU failure of our Acer desktop computer, we were able to successfully diagnose and resolve the issue by cleaning the heat sink and fan. By keeping your computer clean and maintaining it regularly, you can help prevent issues like this from occurring and ensure that your system remains in good working order.

## Chosen Solution
 my central processing shuts off automaticaly if i start windows normally

 1. If your computer beeps when you start it but does not display anything on your monitor:
- Disconnect and reconnect your monitor from your computer.
- Verify that your monitor's power cord is connected and that your monitor is turned on.
- If possible, connect your monitor to a different computer to make sure that your monitor works properly.
- If your monitor works but your computer beeps and displays nothing, your video adapter has probably failed. If your computer is under warranty, contact your computer manufacturer for support. If your computer is not under warranty, and you are comfortable opening your computer's case and replacing internal hardware, purchase and install    a compatible replacement video adapter. Otherwise, contact a service center for assistance. While replacing a part is a nuisance and may be costly, your documents, pictures, and e-mail should be safe and will be available when your computer is fixed.
2. If you see an error message that indicates that a keyboard is not present or a key is stuck, turn off your computer and reconnect your keyboard. If the problem continues, replace your keyboard.
3. Sometimes your computer won't start because your computer is not compatible with a hardware accessory. If you have recently added a new hardware accessory, turn your computer off, remove the accessory, and restart your computer.
4. Remove all hardware accessories except your keyboard, mouse, and monitor. If your computer starts successfully, shut down Windows, turn off your computer, and add one hardware accessory. Then, restart your computer. If your computer fails to start, the hardware accessory you most recently added is causing a problem. Remove the hardware and contact the hardware vendor for support. You can reconnect other hardware accessories.
5. You may have a loose connector. Turn off your computer, remove all connectors from the outside of your computer, and then carefully push the connectors back in. Look for stray wires, bent pins, and loosely fitting connectors.
6. If you are comfortable opening your computer's case, shut down your computer, unplug the power, and open your computer’s case. Remove and reconnect all cables. Remove and reconnect all cards inside your computer, including your computer’s memory chips. Reassemble your computer before attempting to start it again.
7. If your computer still doesn't start, your motherboard, processor, memory, or graphics card may have developed a problem. While failed hardware can be frustrating, your documents, pictures, and email should be safe and will be there when your computer is fixed.
