## Tips To Take A Photo Without Blur/Grain With Your iPhone:
 
If you want your special moments to be photographed in a perfect way, keep these tips and tricks in your mind, the next time you capture a memory.
 
### 1. Keep Your iPhone Steady For Sharp Photos –
 
Keep your hands firm while clicking a photo as you shake your phone, the camera shakes too, resulting in a blurred image. It mostly happens in low-light conditions as the camera needs to use a slower shutter speed to allow enough light in to create a decent exposure.  If you can’t keep your hands steady, then you should use iPhone tripod or you can improvise and can keep it against a wall. One of the reasons for the blurry image is iPhone’s HDR mode when On as HDR takes three quick shots at different exposures and combines them to create the best outcome. If you move your hand while clicking photos, the outcome would be blurry and grainy
 
### 2. Set Focus Point –
 
This is also one of the important things to consider. iPhone’s   autofocus feature is good but to get better focus, it is recommended to set it manually. You can set the focus point by tapping the main subject on the screen in the camera app. A yellow box will appear around the area to determine the focus point.
 
### 3. Take Care Of Exposure –
 
Exposure means brightness and it is everything if you care for the details on the image taken. It is very easy to set brightness on an iPhone. Once you have set the focus and the yellow box appears, wipe up or down on the screen to adjust the brightness.

### 4. Light Is Important –
 
While taking photos, you should pay attention to the direction of light. This is important when you are taking a portrait image where you want to get the face clearly visible.
 
Consider using these small tricks to get a better picture the next time you click. If anything goes wrong, you can always use a noise reduction application to reduce the complexities of the image and get it ready for sharing them with friends and loved ones.
