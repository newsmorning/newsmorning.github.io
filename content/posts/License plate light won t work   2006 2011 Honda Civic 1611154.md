Title: The Shocking Truth Behind Your License Plate Light Failure in 2006-2011 Honda Civic

Introduction:
If you are a 2006-2011 Honda Civic owner, then chances are you may have experienced a recurring issue with your license plate light. This may seem like a minor issue at first, but what if we told you that there's more to it than just a faulty bulb? In this article, we will unveil the shocking truth behind this pervasive problem especially those of you that have experienced it far too frequently or if it happened ever since the car was presented brand new to you.

What Causes License Plate Lights to Stop Working in 2006-2011 Honda Civics?
As it turns out, the cause of this issue can be traced back to the wiring harness that connects to the license plate light assembly. Over time, these wires can become damaged due to exposure to the elements, causing a short circuit that renders the license plate light inoperable. The wires themselves are thin, and over the years, they can become brittle, especially if subjected to extreme temperatures or continuous vibration during vehicle operation.

Why Should You Address the License Plate Light Failure Problem?
You may be wondering why it's worth addressing a seemingly minor issue such as a license plate light. There are several reasons why you should take notice and take action:

1. Safety: Having a license plate light that doesn't work means you cannot be identified or easily tracked down by law enforcement, especially at night. This can raise concerns over your safety and cause potential legal trouble.

2. Aesthetic appeal: A malfunctioning license plate light can make your vehicle appear unsightly. Furthermore, should you decide to sell or trade-in your car, potential buyers are likely to scrutinize every detail and will be deterred by the smallest faults, including a broken license plate light.

3. State Inspection: many States require that you have both your headlights and tail lights working, let alone your license plate light. So, if you often forget about the small details of your car such as your license plate light, are you sure you'll remember to attach that inspection sticker  when it’s time?

How to Fix the License Plate Light Failure Problem?
Luckily, you don't need to visit a mechanic to fix this problem. You can address the issue yourself, and often in a few easy steps. Firstly, you need to disassemble the license plate light assembly and remove the wiring harness. Replace the harness with a new one and reassemble the assembly. These harnesses are readily available online or in any Honda dealership, and they come at a low cost. Lastly, make sure you tape the wires and secure them correctly during the installation.

Conclusion:
While the license plate light failure issue on 2006-2011 Honda Civics may not seem like a significant problem at first, it can have several negative consequences, including legal trouble and a loss of car value. By addressing this issue on time, you can save yourself future trouble and avoid potential danger.

## Chosen Solution
 License plate lights

 check the fuse under the dashboard, number 15 and think its a 7.5, might be blown. other than that check the harness for each bulb, doubt they’d both go if neither bulb works but worth a check,  last resort check for a current when the lights should be on and follow it back to any split wires.
