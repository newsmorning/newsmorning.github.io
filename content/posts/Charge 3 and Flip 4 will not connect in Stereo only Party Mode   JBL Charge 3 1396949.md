# Unleash the Ultimate Party Experience: Discover Why JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 Won't Connect in Stereo Mode!

Are you looking to take your party to the next level? Imagine having the ultimate speakers that deliver crisp, clear sound and a bass that vibrates through your soul. That's where JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 come in! These wireless Bluetooth speakers can be paired in stereo mode for an immersive audio experience that blows your mind. If you're having trouble making them work together, don't worry - this article will help you troubleshoot the issue.

## Step 1: Check the Software Version

To connect the JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 in stereo mode, you need to have the latest software version installed. You can download the JBL Connect+ app to update both the speakers to the latest firmware. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices, and it allows you to manage your JBL devices, connect to other JBL speakers, and customize your sound preferences.

## Step 2: Pair the Speakers

Before you can use the JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 speakers in stereo mode, you need to pair them via Bluetooth. To do this, turn on both speakers and press the Bluetooth button on each speaker. The speakers will start flashing, indicating that they're in pairing mode. Make sure your phone or tablet has Bluetooth enabled and search for available devices. Select the JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 from the list of devices, and they should pair automatically.

If you're having trouble pairing, try resetting the speakers by holding down the power button for at least five seconds until the light flashes. Then repeat the pairing process.

## Step 3: Enable Stereo Mode

Once both speakers are paired, you need to enable stereo mode. To do this, open the JBL Connect+ app and select the JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 from the list of devices connected to your phone or tablet. Tap the "+" sign on each speaker to add them to the stereo pair. You can then select the left and right speakers and modify the balance to your preference. Note that the JBL Connect+ app only works with speakers that have the same version of firmware installed.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you're still having trouble connecting the JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 in stereo mode, here are some additional tips:

- Make sure both speakers are fully charged and at a reasonable distance from each other (within 5 meters).
- If you have other Bluetooth devices connected to your phone or tablet, disconnect them before pairing the JBL speakers.
- Try resetting the JBL Connect+ app (uninstall and reinstall) or using a different compatible device.
- If all else fails, contact JBL customer support for further assistance.

## Conclusion

JBL Charge 3 and Flip 4 are top-of-the-line wireless Bluetooth speakers that offer superior sound quality and a range of features that make them perfect for parties, events, and outdoor activities. By following these steps, you can unlock the true potential of these speakers and achieve an immersive audio experience that will leave your guests in awe. So what are you waiting for?

## Chosen Solution
 I upgraded the Charge 3 to the Connect+ firmware. I have connected the Flip 4 and the Charge 3 together and both work fine in Party Mode. Once I try to select Stereo it throws and error saying to move my phone closer and try again and close the app etc. I have done all that. Turned the speakers on and off. Repaired Bluetooth. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but only seems like party mode works. Please help

 Stereo mode requires two of the same model speakers.

 How do you put a charge three and flip 4 in party mode?

 My two Charge 4s seem to work normally with JBL Connect except that the output is not really stereo even if stereo mode is chosen. Also swapping he channels does not work. Both have the latest firmware 3.0.0.

 I checked the way to connect as stereo. Only one speaker should be paired with the system. Other should not be. Being only one speaker paird with the audio system. Connect the unpaired speaker with paired using the connect button in the speaker. Then the stereo and party mode works fine in the jbl connect app. Remember only one speaker should be paired with the audio system.

 While using two JBL speakers (FLIP 4) in stereo mode,  JBL connect will automatically go to party mode if the music is paused for 5 sec. This is so annoying as app shows it is in stereo mode but actually it will be in party mode. You have to again switch from party mode and again to stereo mode. If the music is paused we have to do it again.
