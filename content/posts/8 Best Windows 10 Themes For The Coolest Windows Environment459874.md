If you use your computer often, you may feel tired of seeing the same Windows environment all the time. Maybe you’d like something more dynamic and pleasing to the eye. If you want to spend a little time customizing your Windows desktop, there are many options to do so. 
 
Besides a simple wallpaper change, you can also completely alter the theme of Windows 10. Depending on the theme, this can change not only your background, but the colors and icons of the Windows desktop and menus. Making this change to Windows 10 can be very simple, as long as you follow the instructions provided by the creator for each download. 
 
Because there are so many themes out there, it can be hard to find quality ones that are enjoyable and useable. So if you’re in search of the best Windows 10 themes available, check out some of the themes listed below. 
 

 
## Grey Eve 
 
If you’re looking to install a theme that can help to reduce strain on your eyes, this nice dark theme is definitely one to try. This theme changes not only your background, but also the style of your windows and menus. 
 
This theme uses only hues of black or grey, so it’s extremely easy on your eyes and can prevent fatigue from using your computer.

## How To Install Themes And Theme Packs
 
Some of these themes may take more work to get fully up and running. This is because Microsoft limits the ease of complete customization, besides wallpaper changes. However, if you follow some guidelines as well as the instructions provided by the theme creators, it shouldn’t be too difficult to set up your new Windows desktop look.
 
When downloading third-party themes, you’ll want to make sure your computer will accept them. Some themes, such as from the Microsoft store, don’t require this. They are compatible with Microsoft’s built-in theme feature. But they usually don’t provide extra changes such as icons and menu colors. To download third-party themes you’ll want to use UltraUXThemePatcher. 
 
You will also want to make sure the theme you’re downloading supports your version of Windows. An easy way to check this is to open Notepad, then go to Help > About Notepad. The latest version is 2004, but you may have 1909, 1903, 1809, etc.
 
Be sure to also create a system restore point before doing any customization at all to your computer, just in case you need to revert back for any reason.
