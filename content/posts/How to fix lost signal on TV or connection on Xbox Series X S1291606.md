If you're a gamer or a TV buff, you know how frustrating it is to lose your signal right in the middle of your favorite show or game. You're not alone in this, and fortunately, there's a quick and easy fix that will put an end to your connection woes.

The Xbox Series X/S is the latest offering from Microsoft, encompassing an unprecedented feature set and powerful hardware suited for video games. The accompanying TV is the player's gateway to a more immersive gaming experience. But, while these two devices are ideal partners for each other, there's one issue that has been bothering users - the erratic and unstable signal quality.

You don't have to suffer from lost signals and connectivity issues anymore. The answer to your problem is using a technology called an HDMI repeater. An HDMI repeater is an electronic device that sits between your Xbox Series X/S and your TV, increasing the signal strength and ensuring you enjoy uninterrupted connectivity.

If you're unfamiliar with an HDMI repeater, it's a device that can amplify the signal from your Xbox Series X/S to your TV, increasing the range of the signal and reducing interference along the way. It's an excellent solution for any entertainment system that experiences issues with the signal.

Here are some of the benefits of an HDMI repeater:

1. Restoration of picture quality

An HDMI repeater can restore the original picture quality and provide a precise signal. You'll get to enjoy your games and shows in their Full HD and 4K glory without any distortion or pixelation.

2. Elimination of signal loss

An HDMI repeater can compensate for any signal loss that could occur due to the length of the HDMI cable. The HDMI repeater will amplify and increase the range of the signal, ensuring that you get an uninterrupted connection with your gaming console.

3. Reduces latency

An HDMI repeater prioritizes the signal and reduces latency, making it ideal for playing video games on your Xbox Series X/S. You won't experience any lag or delay in your button inputs, ensuring that your gameplay experience is always smooth.

4. Easy to install

An HDMI repeater is easy to install, and anyone can do it. All you need to do is plug your HDMI cable into the repeater and then connect the repeater to your TV and Xbox Series X/S.

Conclusion

In conclusion, an HDMI repeater is a simple and cost-effective solution to resolve any signal loss and connectivity issues that you might be experiencing with your Xbox Series X/S and TV. By following this simple fix, you can say goodbye to lost signals and begin enjoying your gaming and entertainment system to the fullest. Say hello to uninterrupted game time and avoid the frustration of losing connectivity when you don't want to. Use an HDMI repeater and make the most of your TV and gaming experience.

Microsoft has warned since a few days ago about issues that might spoil the gaming experience for several users. Luckily, they also offer reliable fixes.
 
If you’re connecting the console to a 4K/120hz smart TV, using the EA Play/BBC iPlayer app, or trying a DVD/Blu-ray into the console, you might encounter on Xbox Series X|S no signal on TV, see this troubleshooting advice first.
 
## How do I fix Xbox console common issues?
 
### 1. Lost signal to TV HDMI error with 4K 120Hz + VRR 
 
According to Microsoft, on 4K 120Hz TVs that also support VRR, one might encounter signal failures or corrupted images when the Xbox is configured for 4K120+VRR. The issue occurs with LG, Samsung, or Vizio TVs, but not exclusively.
 
Solution:
 
- Make sure your TV has the latest firmware installed. Also, check that your TV is connected to the Internet and that Automatic Updates are enabled.
 - Try resolution variations with/without VRR:
 - Go to Setting > General > TV & display options> Video Modes and check/uncheck the box for Allow variable refresh rate.
 - Modify the resolution and refresh rate from TV & Display options > Display section.
 - Try 1080p/120hz + VRR or 1440p/120hz + VRR.
 - Disable VRR on the TV altogether if the corrupted image persists.
 - Additionally, you can perform a video mode reset and reset your resolution as shown in this troubleshooting article.

 
### 2. EA Play or BBC iPlayer app won’t launch/install
 
In case the EA Play or BBC iPlayer app won’t launch or install on your new console, there is no fix, unfortunately. It seems that this is a matter of compatibility.
 
- Go to Setting > General > TV & display options> Video Modes and check/uncheck the box for Allow variable refresh rate.
 - Modify the resolution and refresh rate from TV & Display options > Display section.
 - Try 1080p/120hz + VRR or 1440p/120hz + VRR.

 
However, Microsoft is working with its app partners for a quick solution.
 
Want to play full games included with your EA Play subscription? No problem; access them in My Games & Apps > Full Library > EA Play.
 
### 3. Dark HDR captures
 
Another known issue is that HDR captures might appear too dark on the two consoles.
 
Once again, there is no workaround suggested yet, only a promise for a future fix.
 
### 4. Black screen when inserting DVD/ Blue-ray
 
This is actually a recurring issue with Xbox consoles: the screen turns black after inserting a DVD or Blu-ray disc.
 
Solution: 
 
Just remove the disc from the console, restart your Xbox Series X|S, and then re-insert the disc. The issue should be fixed.
 
### 5. Pixelated frames on the PeacockTV app
 
Last but not least, users might see occasional pixelated frames when using the PeacockTV app on their console.
 
This is yet another unsolved issue, that Microsoft experts are still trying to fix in a future update.
 
As seen, some of the problems are acknowledged by Microsoft, yet with no workaround. This can only mean that manufacturer will release patches pretty soon, with one of the updates to come.
 
Until then, we hope that your gaming experience won’t suffer much. If you do manage to bypass any of these issues, tell us how you did it in the comments.
