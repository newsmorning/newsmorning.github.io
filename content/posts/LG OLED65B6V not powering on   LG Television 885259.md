If you’re an owner of the LG OLED65B6V, you know that it’s one of the best televisions on the market. It has a sleek design, impressive resolution, and vibrant color. However, some users have reported that their LG OLED65B6V is refusing to turn on. If you’re experiencing this issue, you won't believe the reason why.

After investigating the issue, we discovered that the cause for the OLED65B6V's refusal to turn on is due to an overheating issue. Yes, you read that right. The TV is simply too hot. And while this may sound like an easy fix, it's not. 

The LG OLED65B6V is designed to dissipate heat through the vents located on the back of the TV. However, these vents can become clogged with dust or debris over time, which restricts the airflow and prevents the TV from cooling properly. This causes the TV to overheat, which triggers a safety feature that shuts the TV down to prevent damage.

So, what can you do about it? 

The first step is to clean the vents. Using a can of compressed air, blow out any dust or debris that may be clogging the vents. If that doesn’t work, try moving the TV to a well-ventilated area where it can cool down properly. Additionally, you may also want to consider investing in a cooling mat, which can help absorb excess heat.

Another important detail to take note of is the location of your LG OLED65B6V. The TV's location can play a significant role in its performance. Placing the TV in direct sunlight, for example, can cause the system to overheat. This is particularly true in areas with warmer weather.

It's also important to note that this issue is not unique to the LG OLED65B6V. All electrical devices, including televisions, are susceptible to overheating. The most important thing you can do is remain aware of the warning signs, such as the TV refusing to turn on or the volume cutting in and out.

In conclusion, if your LG OLED65B6V is refusing to turn on, the reason may be due to an overheating issue. By taking steps to clean the vents, move the TV to a well-ventilated area, and keep it out of direct sunlight, you can ensure that your TV remains in top condition for years to come.


## Chosen Solution
 My TV will not turn on and there is no standby red light either.  After switching off power at the socket on and off a few times the TV will randomly turn on and I see the red standby light.  Once running there seems to be no issues.  However if I turn off the TV it almost always has issues turning on again until I power on/off a few times.
Any ideas?  A faulty power board?

 Hi @frnw ,
Have you checked if the power outlet is OK? It may be a faulty switch in the outlet. Try connecting to another outlet. Also if the TV is connected via a powerboard (powerstrip?) connect it directly to the wall outlet if you have proved that the wall outlet is OK
The power board sends a voltage signal to the mainboard when there is power connected to the power board and it is the mainboard that turns on the Standby power light if the signal is the correct value.
If the power outlet is OK you would need to check the standby voltage on the power board first to determine where the problem is.
