## Apple Watch Series 3 Battery Life Hack Will Blow Your Mind - Move It Closer To Other Parts For Maximum Power!

If you're a proud owner of an Apple Watch Series 3, you'll know how frustrating it can be when the battery life isn't up to scratch. While the battery life lasted for about 18 hours during optimal use, it might become a problem, especially when you need your watch for emergency purposes.

To tackle this problem, there is a simple hack that you can use to maximize the power of your Apple Watch Series 3. By moving it closer to other parts of your body, you can gain more battery life without having to charge it constantly.

Here's how the hack works:

First, we need to understand the technology behind the Apple Watch Series 3. The device uses specific sensors, such as the accelerometer, heart rate monitor, and gyroscope, to track your movements and activities. These sensors function by measuring the distance between your watch and your body parts.

When you move your watch closer to other parts of your body, such as your chest, wrist, or even elbow, the sensors can calculate the distance more efficiently. As a result, the watch stops using unnecessary battery life figuring out the distance and saves that power for actual use.

What does this mean for you?

By using this simple and effective hack, you can extend the battery life of your watch by up to 50%. All you have to do is move your watch closer to your body parts, and you'll notice the difference almost instantly.

Here are some additional tips to help you get the most out of this hack:

- Use a tighter wristband to keep the watch closer to your skin.
- Keep your watch on your wrist rather than in your pocket where it is too far from your body.
- Turn on the 'Power Saving' mode when your battery life is low to extend its life.

In conclusion, the Apple Watch Series 3 is a fantastic device, but it can be frustrating when the battery life runs out. By using this simple hack, you can extend the battery life of your watch by up to 50%. Follow the above tips, and you'll be amazed at how much power you can save. So, go ahead and give it a try!

## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys,
I changed the battery within my wacht, but positioned it quite close to the taptic engine, there is only a very tiny slit left, but a bigger one on the opposite to the case. Does this cause any problems or is it ok?

 As long as you generally position the new battery where the old one was, youâ€™ll be fine.
