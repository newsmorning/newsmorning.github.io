## Chosen Solution
 I have a HS 110 Holy Stone drone. I've had it for about a month and have enjoyed it so much! I've flown with no problems at all except and occasional minor crash, nothing major at all. I was flying it the other day and everything was fine, no problems at all. The battery got low in the drone so I changed the battery in it and paired it with the controller but I noticed it wouldn't  let me calibrate it. When I tried to take off it flew maybe 7 feet in the air and landed on it's own and wouldn't take off again. I thought maybe it was a dead battery so I put another in, and put fresh batteries in the controller. I got the same results this time, seemed to pair with the controller, wouldn't let me calibrate it but this time the rotors wouldn't turn and it just sat there with the lights blinking.
Can anyone help me? I'm at a loss ...

 Hello,
I also had issues with ProMark p70 drone calibration. But the problem was I calibrated it close to the garage doors, and it didn’t make any progress. So the issue wasn’t gps.
A couple of useful guides for your model:

Calibrate the drone’s compass each time that you fly an article by April Klazema

 Mine did the same thing  I figured out what was wrong it was in GPS mode hold the compass button for 3 sec and it will go out of it.

 My ha 165 holy stone drone work fine yesterday but now when I try to take off all it does is blinking it’s lights at the same time not fast will unlock motors but won’t take off

 I think I know the issue I had this on mine. You need to make sure it is not in GPS mode. It starts in GPS mode by default for some reason but it won’t take off in that mode.

 So I got a hs161 flew it then recharged the battery after first flight. Full charged now but drone won't turn on
