Title: Warning: Lenovo Legion Y540 17Irh Owners Beware - Ac Adapters Are Dropping Like Flies!

Introduction:

Lenovo is a reputable brand for producing top-class laptops, and the Lenovo Legion Y540 17IRH is one of their most popular products. However, recent reports have shown a problem with the AC adapters of the device, which is causing concerns amongst users.

Body:

The Lenovo Legion Y540 17IRH is a high-end gaming laptop that requires a steady power source to function optimally. Unfortunately, the original AC adapters for these laptops have been failing at an alarming rate. Users have reported that the adapters tend to overheat and then shut down without warning. In some cases, the AC adapter simply stops working, leaving the user stranded without power.

The problem appears to be widespread, and many Lenovo Legion Y540 17IRH users have reported experiencing similar issues. This problem is not limited to a particular region or batch of products but appears to be affecting users across the globe.

According to Lenovo, the issue was initially attributed to a faulty batch of components used in the production process. The company has reportedly identified the faulty components and has since advised users to cease using the AC adapter until they receive a replacement.

Lenovo has also provided a dedicated support page for customers to report any issues with their laptops and receive solutions to their problems. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how long Lenovo will take to replace the affected AC adapters.

Conclusion:

If you are a Lenovo Legion Y540 17IRH owner, it is essential to be aware of the current AC adapter issue. It is advisable to discontinue using the laptop if you experience any problems with the AC adapter and contact Lenovo's customer support for a replacement.

In conclusion, Lenovo is a reputable brand, but it has encountered a significant quality issue with the Legion Y540 17IRH's AC adapter. Lenovo must address the issue to maintain its position as a reliable brand for producing high-quality laptops. We hope Lenovo will quickly resolve this issue and ensure it doesn't happen again in the future.


## Chosen Solution
 So I've done a thorough amount of background research to little to no avail on this topic. Basically this is what's going on: the AC adapter functions perfectly normal at first then over a series of months the pin out and power port on the laptop gets extremely hot under load eventually the pin stops charging the laptop correctly without being angled in and after that it'll stop working entirely. Yet when I buy a new AC adapter that works perfectly fine for a few months until the problem repeats itself. I've taken apart laptop and thoroughly examined the port and it looks undamaged isn't missing any of the pieces as far as I can tell (black plastic bit  and side prongs are still there). The only thing I know for sure is that this is a very widespread problem in this particular laptop, is it because the poor is malfunctioning or is it the quality of the materials in said adapter causing extreme heating and cooling leading to damage and shrinkage?

 Hi,
Have you tried changing the DC-In jack (supplier example only)?
Localized heating of components in electrical circuits can sometimes be due to a voltage drop across the component caused by a resistive connection when perhaps there shouldn’t be one e.g. a resistive connection between plug and socket due to lack of tension in socket spring terminals or incorrect sizing between the two (plug and socket) or perhaps an internal dry joint connection in the socket itself.
It could also be caused by excess current flow through the component. This current may not be enough to blow a fuse perhaps but over time may be enough to damage the component. The charger specs state that the output is 8.5A/11.5A so presumably the socket should be rated to handle the higher value
Normally the resistance between the input and the output sides of a DC-In socket would be either 0.00Ω (short circuit) or no more than approx. 0.03Ω.
Without a schematic for the motherboard (I couldn’t find one - is it a FY715 NM-C541 motherboard?) it would be hard to find a suitable testing point, just after the DC-In jack output connections (presumably hard to access on the socket itself) to test to see if there is a voltage drop between the input to the jack and the output of the jack i.e. measure the voltage at the adapter plug before insertion into the jack and then measure the voltage at a suitable point very close to the output (motherboard side) of the DC-In jack.
Just what I’d try.
