Have you ever experienced a cracked screen on your beloved smartphone? It is common for many people to drop their phones, leading to cracked screens. I was a victim of this too, and I decided to order a screen for my Google Pixel 4. The experience was shocking, and you won't believe what happened.

As a gadget enthusiast, I had heard of the importance of screen protection. Since the day I got my Google Pixel 4, I had been searching for the perfect screen protector that would keep my phone safe while ensuring that the display remained crystal clear. After weeks of research, I found a reputable company online that specialized in producing screen protectors. I decided to give them a try.

Upon receiving the package, I was horrified to find out that the company had shipped the wrong type of screen protector. It was an older version that was not compatible with my phone's curved display. I was devastated because I had spent a considerable amount of money on the product.

I immediately contacted the company and explained my situation. They were apologetic and suggested that I return the product and get a refund. After a few days, I received an email confirming that my refund had been processed, and I was free to reorder another screen protector.

This time around, I was more careful and did extensive research on the company's products before ordering. I also checked and double-checked the product specifications to confirm that it was compatible with my phone. To my delight, the screen protector arrived safely, and it was perfect.

Since then, I have been using the screen protector on my phone, and I must say I am impressed. The display is crystal clear, and the touch response is intact. What's more, the protector has shielded my phone from scratches and cracks, and I am confident that my phone will remain in top condition for a long time.

In conclusion, it is essential to protect your phone's screen to avoid costly repairs. However, before ordering a screen protector, ensure that you do your research and purchase one that is compatible with your device. You do not want to end up in a situation like mine. Remember, prevention is better than cure.

## Chosen Solution
 I recently ordered a new screen because my previous one was damaged. When I finally got around to installing it, there was a green line and a black splotch at the top of the screen. I am not sure how this happened but seeing as it was like this imediatly upon installing it, I'd assume it would be a dead pixel or group of dead pixels. I don't know the procedure or if this is grounds for a return, I'd like to know if I can fix it or if I'll need to returnÂ this one and / or order a new one. Thank you in advance! :)

 Definitely sounds like the screen was damaged in some way either during shipping or other means. I would return it for a replacement.
