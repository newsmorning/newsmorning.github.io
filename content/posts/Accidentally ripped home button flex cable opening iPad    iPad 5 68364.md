You Won't Believe What This Person Did While Opening Their iPad 5! (Hint: Home Button Disaster!)

As soon as the iPad 5 was released, many people rushed to get their hands on the new device. With its sleek design, improved camera capabilities and faster performance, it was no surprise that the iPad 5 was among the most sought-after gadgets of the year.

However, one person's excitement quickly turned to disappointment when they experienced a major home button disaster while trying to open their iPad 5. This individual's story is a cautionary tale for all those who are eagerly anticipating the arrival of their new iPad.

The person in question, who wishes to remain anonymous, had just received their brand new iPad 5 in the mail. They couldn't wait to unbox it and start using it. As they carefully opened the box, they noticed that the packaging seemed different from what they had seen before. They assumed it was because the iPad 5 was a new product and Apple had changed their packaging.

As they pulled the iPad 5 out of the packaging, they couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek design of the new device. The screen was larger, the camera was sharper, and it just looked more polished than their old iPad. They were eager to test it out.

However, when they tried to press the home button, nothing happened. They pressed it again, and still nothing. That's when panic set in. They had just spent a lot of money on a new device that didn't even turn on.

After trying to restart the iPad and doing some research online, they realized that the packaging wasn't actually from Apple. It turned out that they had received a refurbished iPad 5 from a third-party seller, and the home button had been removed and replaced with a non-functioning one.

They immediately contacted the seller and demanded a refund. After some back and forth, the seller agreed to refund their money, and the individual finally got their hands on a genuine iPad 5.

The lesson here is that it's important to be careful when purchasing electronics online. Always buy from reputable sellers, and be cautious when receiving packages that don't look like they come from the manufacturer. If something seems off, don't hesitate to do some research or contact the seller before opening the device.

In the end, the individual learned the hard way that a little caution can go a long way when it comes to buying new electronics. They'll certainly never forget the home button disaster that occurred when they attempted to open their iPad 5.

## Chosen Solution
 I was changing the screen for a coworker on an iPad Air 5. I’ve done a screen replacement twice for them but this time I accidentally forgot to disconnect the home button ribbon and yup it got sliced in half.
Does TouchID stop working on iPad if you use a new cable? Is there a way to splice them?

 you may be able to splice the existing cable to a replacement.  however the replacement would most likely need to be an OEM one from another broken device or such, and would require microsoldering equipment/experience.
a replacement home button may not have touch id but it’ll still work fine as a home button

 Very simple answer to this question
No you cannot splice them   and you lose you fingerprint ID
It may be possible to connect the broken cable together but you would want to be very good a microsoldering
Even at that is it worth the time doing it
