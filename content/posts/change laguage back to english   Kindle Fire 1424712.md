The above video shows somebody going through the options of changing the language on a Kindle Fire HD. Now, while he goes through the steps while the Kindle is in English, you should be able to press the same options by counting down. For example, he presses the "Language and Keyboard" option in settings. This option is the 9th option down from the top. Then, he taps the first option for "Device Language". From there it should be obvious which is English.
