# Is Your LG Smart TV Refusing to Turn On? Discover the Surprising Solution!

LG smart TVs bring entertainment to your fingertips with their advanced features and optimized display technology. However, imagine settling down on the couch to catch up on your favorite TV show or Netflix series, only to find that your LG smart TV refuses to turn on. It can be frustrating, and you might wonder what could be the problem. In this article, we explore some of the potential causes of this issue and the surprising solution that could work for you.

## Potential Causes of Your LG Smart TV Refusing to Turn On

Before we delve into the solution, let's explore some of the reasons why your LG smart TV may refuse to turn on. Here are some of the potential causes:

### 1. Power Supply Issues

The first thing to check is whether the TV is receiving power. Ensure that the power outlet you're using is working correctly, and the power cord is correctly plugged in. If it's a power supply issue, adjusting the power source could fix the problem.

### 2. Remote Control

Sometimes, the problem might originate from the remote control. The batteries might be dead, or it could be damaged, preventing the TV from turning on. Try swapping the batteries or using a different remote control to see if that's the problem.

### 3. The TV's Settings

Sometimes, an issue with the TV's settings could prevent it from turning on. For instance, if the display resolution is set too high, it could overload the TV's processor and keep it from turning on. Try resetting the TV to its factory settings and see if that helps.

### 4. Software Updates

LG smart TVs require software updates to operate correctly. Sometimes, outdated software could cause the TV to malfunction, including refusing to turn on. Check your TV's settings to ensure that you have the latest software updates.

## A Surprising Solution to Your LG Smart TV Refusing to Turn On

If you've tried all the potential causes above and none seems to be the problem, then it's time to consider a surprising solution. LG smart TVs have a "Quick Start+" feature that puts the TV in standby mode instead of turning it off. This feature makes it easy to resume your viewing experience the next time you want to watch something.

However, if this feature is enabled, it may prevent your TV from turning on. The solution? Disable the Quick Start+ feature. Here are the steps to follow:

- Press the Home button on your remote control.
- Select Settings and navigate to the General tab.
- Scroll down and select the Quick Start+ option.
- Toggle it off and exit the Settings menu.

After disabling the Quick Start+ feature, try turning on your TV again using the remote control. The issue should be resolved, and you can enjoy your viewing experience once again.

In conclusion, if your LG smart TV is refusing to turn on, don't panic. Start by checking the power supply, remote control, and TV settings. If none of these seem to solve the issue, try disabling the Quick Start+ feature, and you might be surprised at the results.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I have an LG TV 65UM7300AUE and it won't turn on. There is no red light on the IR sensor and I've followed all the basic troubleshooting. After that I have been buying parts from ebay, trying each one to see if it fixes the issue. I tried replacing the power supply board, main video board, IR button and sensor, IR/WIFI cable and lastly the power supply board to main video board power cable and it's still not turning on. I'm at a loss of what's going on with the TV. Any suggestions or help is appreciated.

 Hi @gabrielomarpr
You may have to start again as you can't be certain that the replacement parts were OK or not.
Here's a composite image of the No Power troubleshooting procedure, taken from the service manual that may help.

If you get the correct standby power at the power board, check that it gets OK to the mainboard as it may be a faulty cable between the two. It is the mainboard that turns on the red standby power light.
