## Chosen Solution
 I'm looking for the schematic for Samsung S27B970D monitor

 You Wish try connecting by another means . Can you connect with an hdmi cable or dvi  or vga . Have you tried attaching it to a different computer . Have you tried static discharge . Unplug the monitor and drain any residual power by holding the power button down for 60 seconds . Then plug it back in and reboot the computer . Also try a hard reset . This is done by holding the power button down till the monitor shuts off continue holding till it powers back on . the whole cycle should take about a minute or slightly longer. Hope something here helps

 Since a repair is likely not an option, try replacing  the main board.  You can find one here:

Its worth the $15 to try and fix this, I think.

 Are the ribbon cables soldered into the PCB'S, or do they have 'typical' 2-row header sockets that mate with opposite gender header pins like old IDE hard drive cables? If the latter, they are probably IDC type (insulation displacement connector). If they can be disconnected at both ends you can gently apply pressure to socket connectors in a flat-jawed vice.
Inspect any soldered cables, especially the movable ones, with magnification for broken connections.
If you can get the PCB(s) out, inspect solder with magnification. That will take a long time, but be patient. That is what is done if a replacement costs much more than your labor for repair, or is unavailable, or not practical for other reasons. You alone get to make the decision whether it's uneconomical or if investing time and fixing something possibly simple has value to you. It's worth the exercise if you see learning from the experience, even if unsuccessful, as having value.
I think either there was a latent solder defect, or maybe cable damage if you were moving it aggressively or beyond it's intended range or frequency of repositioning. Many adjustable items use flex wiring/harnesses that last the products lifetime.
If the problem developed during your actions, you >might< deserve partial credit, but it's more likely something is open-circuited than short-circuited.
Also, search for the board number rather than the modelâ€¦it may lead you to documentation or an alternate source like a different model.
It often takes good eyes and inspection, rather than knowledge of how it works, to find simple problems. The tech with more experience may not be able to see as well, but can more quickly determine what's economical or not (from a corporate $ perspective).
