## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
HELP!
Unfortunately my phone was recently returned to factory settings without backing up the data. I am attempting to recover the pictures that where on the phone during the reset.
Im using an old HTC wildfire s on Android. 2.3.5 software 2.26.771.2
I have tried recovering the data my self using numerous recovery programs. I either the device is not recognised, cannot find the older files, or retrieves (what I presume to be the files in a .TGA format which are in fact blank.
Upon querying this I was told rooting the phone would help. I have tried this but when using HTC Super Tool v2 & Kingo Root I received error messages telling me the ROM was outdated or the software was outdated and they couldnt root.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!! otherwise i'll give up and send it to some company.
Many thanks,
SNC

 Hi SNC,
Unfortunately, I think you may have exhausted the limit of current recovery options available for android devices. At this point, you would be looking at a data recovery service (forensic level stuff) that can range in the thousands. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I would not mind being proven wrong at all for the chance to learn a new technique if you come across a solution. However, at this point, I believe that none exist.

 Provided that you have tried many android data recovery tools, most of android data recovery tools will root your phone without notification. That's to say, even you root the htc, it is hardly to restore the lost files and the old files probably have been overwritten by new content already.
I don't know if you have tried jihosoft android phone recovery, they said it can recover data after factory reset android, you can give it a try.
