Duplicate files in computers cause performance issues since they use valuable hard drive space, slowing down the entire system. 
 
- If you realize that you have redundant identical copies of files, directories, and system entries, this is not unusual on a Windows computer.
 - As a result, in order to maintain control over their own performance, most applications carry and install their own copies of various libraries and support files.
 - If you've been managing photographs or music on your computer and feel that you have a lot of duplicates, a file scan will reveal what is unnecessary.

 
The more duplicate files there are, the more crowded the system becomes. This may result in poor overall PC performance or files and applications that will no longer open.
 
Identical files occur for a variety of reasons, and whatever you’re doing on your Windows 11 PC isn’t at the top of the list of the reasons.
 
There are, however, a variety of other third-party software tools that perform an excellent job of decluttering hard disk space. 
 
Firstly, we strongly recommend avoiding removing duplicate files by yourself. We understand that doing so piques your interest in cleaning the PC. But if you do this in the wrong way, it can soon leave your computer unbootable.
 
The best duplicate file finder will have different functions customized to your needs and wants. Everyone is different and doing various activities on the PC, so we advise you to choose what’s best for you. 
 
Let’s have a look at the options we have for Windows 11 operating system and how those apps can be useful.
 
### Does Windows 11 have a duplicate file finder?
 
The Windows 11 operating system lacks native features for removing duplicate files. However, there is one we tested available in the Microsoft store that has basic functions if you want to try it.
 
The Windows 11 PC labels similar graphics as duplicates, so it may be difficult for it to which version of a video or song you consider a copy. 
 
You may also generate an inventory of everything on your computer. Even so, we recommend doing so just for your Music, Pictures, Documents, and Videos folders. Doing it elsewhere will result in thousands of system files you don’t need to modify in this scenario.
 
A duplicate file finder may discover differences between photos, videos, music, and files with the same content but encoded differently.
 
Text and documents are generally more straightforward to make a difference since written words can be detected easily.
