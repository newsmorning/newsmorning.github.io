Is Your LG Washing Machine Constantly Pausing Mid-Cycle? Find Out How to Fix the Common OE Drain Issue Now!

If you are a proud owner of an LG washing machine, but lately you have been experiencing a frustrating issue where your machine keeps pausing mid-cycle, then you are not alone. Many LG washing machine users like you have reported this problem, and it is commonly caused by an OE drain issue. Although it seems like a daunting problem, it is often a straightforward issue that you can fix yourself with just a few simple steps.

Here is what you need to do to fix the common OE drain issue:

Step 1: Check for Obstructions in the Drain Hose

One of the most common reasons for your LG washing machine to stop mid-cycle is when there is a blockage in the drain hose. Take a look at the hose and see if there are any kinks or twists that might be preventing water from flowing through the hose properly. Remove any obstructions that you find, and straighten the hose as much as possible. After this, try running the machine to check if the problem has been resolved.

Step 2: Check for Clogs in the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter is responsible for catching any debris that might clog up the machine's drain. If there is something stuck in the filter, then it could cause the OE error to occur. To fix this issue, locate the filter, which is usually located behind an access panel or near the bottom of the machine. Once you find it, remove any debris that might be clogging it up, and then put it back in place.

Step 3: Check the Drain Pipe for Blockages

If neither the drain hose nor the drain pump filter was the cause of the OE error in your LG washing machine, you should inspect your home’s drain pipe for blockages. Sometimes, lint or other debris from the machine's laundry can accumulate in the drain, which can cause water to back up and stop mid-cycle. Try using a plunger or a snake tool to remove any clogs that you find in the drain pipe.

Step 4: Reset the Machine

If none of the previous steps resolves the issue, try resetting your LG washing machine. To do this, turn off the machine and unplug it from the power source. Wait for at least five minutes, and then plug it back in and turn it on. Once the machine has restarted, try running a new cycle and see if the OE error persists.

In conclusion, if your LG washing machine is continually pausing mid-cycle, it may be due to an OE error. The good news is that it is often a relatively simple problem to fix, and the above steps can help you address it y yourself. If the issue persists or becomes more prevalent after trying these steps, it may be time to call a professional for further assessment and repair.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an LG Wm2010cw. It's a frontoading washing machine. Recently I have been getting an OE error, which is a drain problem. I've checked the pump filter, checked the hoses, all clear. Interestingly, when I ran a Rinse/Spin on the already sopping wet clothes, it finished the cycle with no errors! Any thoughts on how I can fix this so I don't have to manually reset every load?

 Hi @ct53 ,
Don’t know the answer but the here’s an image of the drain malfunction troubleshooting flowchart taken from the  service manual.

Also on p.13 it shows how to get into the test mode for the washer to test the various functions of the washer including the drain pump.
Hopefully a start.
