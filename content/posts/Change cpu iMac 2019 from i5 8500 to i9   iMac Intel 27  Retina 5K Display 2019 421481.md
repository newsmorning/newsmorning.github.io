Unleash The Power: Upgrade Your iMac 2019 From i5 8500 To The Beastly i9 Processor!

The iMac 2019 is a sleek and powerful machine that is capable of handling a wide range of tasks, from everyday use to more demanding tasks such as video editing and gaming. However, if you truly want to unleash its full potential, there's one upgrade that you should consider: replacing the i5 8500 processor with the beastly i9 processor. In this article, we'll look at why you should upgrade and how to do it.

Why Upgrade?

The i5 8500 processor is no slouch, but it's not as powerful as the i9. The i9 processor has 8 cores and 16 threads, compared to the i5's 6 cores and 6 threads. This means that it can handle more tasks simultaneously, making it ideal for tasks like video editing or running multiple virtual machines. Additionally, the i9 has a higher clock speed, meaning that it can complete tasks faster than the i5.

The i9 also comes with a larger cache, which means that it can store more data for quicker access. This is particularly useful if you work with large files or databases. All in all, upgrading to the i9 will give your iMac a significant boost in performance, making it faster and more efficient at handling demanding tasks.

How to Upgrade

Before you start upgrading, you'll need to ensure that your iMac is compatible with the i9 processor. The i9 requires a different socket type than the i5, so you'll need to make sure that your iMac's motherboard can handle it. Additionally, you'll need to check that your iMac's thermal management system is sufficient to handle the increased heat generated by the i9. If you're unsure about any of this, it's best to consult a professional.

Assuming your iMac is compatible, the first step is to purchase the i9 processor. You can buy it from a variety of online retailers or from Apple directly. Once you have the processor, you'll need to open up your iMac and replace the i5 with the i9. This is not a simple process, so unless you're confident in your technical abilities, it's best to leave it to a professional.

Conclusion

Upgrading your iMac's processor to the i9 is a surefire way to unleash its full potential. The i9 is significantly more powerful than the i5, with more cores, threads, and cache. It'll make your iMac faster and more efficient at handling demanding tasks like video editing or running multiple virtual machines. However, keep in mind that upgrading the processor is not a simple process, and it's best to consult a professional unless you're confident in your technical skills. With the i9 processor, your iMac will become the ultimate powerhouse.


## Chosen Solution
 I'm wondering to buy imac 2019 27inch mmr12, or mrq12, does the both imac support i9 9900k?(9900) or it has different cooling systems?

 All the systems in the series use the exact same cooling system (heat sink & fan)
At this point I doubt anyone has altered their system. And frankly I don’t recommend you do it either until your warranty coverage has expired. Even then there are risks! IF you don’t use the correct tools and techniques you can damage the display assembly just in the process of opening the system. You would need to fully remove the logic board to gain access to the CPU socket. The iMac heat sink is a bit tough getting back on and you could damage the logic board in the process.
Video Card is the biggest difference Radeon Pro 575X Vs a Radeon Pro 580X (I would want the better GPU)
27” iMac pricing
So is the cost difference (aprox. $300) that much when you add in the added cost of the replacement CPU, needed tools and supplies? I would just buy the better system if thats what you want.

 Hi, I have just done the upgrade from iMac 27 2019, i5 8500k to i9 9900kf. 
You must be very careful changing the cpu, it’s easy to damage the pins under the cpu. Puting back the cooler is the hardest part of the surgery. Also no heat problem or full speed running fan. Everything’s running smooth for now.  
I also install Samsung 980 pro with the hope that it runs at full speed, but there is no benefit at all. Because it’s not running at full speed. You don’t get more than 3000 write and read speed because of Pcie 3.0 x4. 
So I put back my Samsung 970 evo and happy with it for now.
It’s worth doing it, your iMac gets really fast and you can keep it longer :). I guess this is the last iMac models you can modify…
