Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried to Charge My HP 7 1800! Find out How Identifying Wires Saved My Battery!

Introduction

One of the most frustrating things that can happen to a gadget lover is finding out that their device won't charge. This can be doubly frustrating when the device in question is a tablet, like the HP 7 1800. Recently, I ran into this issue and set out to troubleshoot and get to the bottom of the problem. After some trial and error, I found out the solution to the issue was identifying wires. In this article, I will take you through my experience and give you tips on how to identify wires to save your tablet's battery.

The issue

The trouble began when I connected my HP 7 1800 tablet to the charging cable as usual. However, I noticed that the tablet did not show any sign of charging, which was odd because it had never happened before. I tried a few different outlets and cables to no avail. Feeling worried, I decided to investigate the issue myself. After doing some research, I found out the battery probably wasn't the issue - it was likely a wiring issue instead.

Identifying the wires

Next, I took apart my tablet to identify the wires. There are two wires in the charging port of most tablets and smartphones that deliver the current to the battery. These wires are the positive and the negative ones. To identify them, I used a multimeter that I borrowed from my neighbor. I set the multimeter to the continuity test mode and attached the probes to the wires, one at a time. When the two probes touched, the continuity beeped, confirming that the wire was positive or negative. I labeled the wires to make sure I remembered which was which, and then put the tablet back together.

Solution

After identifying the wires, I realized that the cable had a broken wire, which was why my tablet was not charging. I replaced the broken wire, making sure it was correctly attached to the positive and negative terminals. Then, I re-connected the charging cable to my tablet, and voila, it started charging as expected!

Conclusion

Identifying wires can be a daunting task, but it is necessary when it comes to troubleshooting charging issues. By following the steps I outlined in this article, you can identify which wire is broken and replace it yourself. Of course, if you are not comfortable with taking apart your device, it is best to take it to a professional for repair. However, with a little effort and patience, you can save your battery, and your wallet, by identifying the wires that power your device.

 Ian I Lowery 
Black—Negative
Red— Positive
White—thermistor terminal to monitor the battery temperature (charging etc)
Yellow—BSI Battery system/status indicator

 The common wire color is black negative and red positive. The other wires are for temperature feed back and charge feed back.
