Unveiling the Secret Polarity of Your Dyson DC35 AC DC Adapter Plug - You Won't Believe What We Discovered!

Have you ever struggled with a Dyson DC35 AC DC Adapter Plug and wondered which polarity to use? If so, you're not alone. Many Dyson users have had trouble figuring out the secret polarity of this adapter plug. But worry not – we've delved into the depths of this mystery and are finally ready to reveal our findings!

First, let's talk a bit about what exactly we mean by polarity. In essence, polarity refers to the direction of electrical flow in a circuit. The Dyson DC35 AC DC Adapter Plug has two connectors: a positive one and a negative one. When you plug it in, it's important to make sure you connect the right terminals, otherwise your Dyson device won't work.

Now, onto the secret polarity of the Dyson DC35 AC DC Adapter Plug. In our research, we discovered that the polarity of this adapter plug is reversed compared to what you might expect. In other words, the negative terminal is in the center of the connector and the positive one is on the outside. This is opposite of what you typically see in most DC plugs, where the center conductor is positive and the outer conductor is negative.

So why did Dyson choose to use this reversed polarity? We can only speculate, but it seems likely that it was done for safety reasons. By reversing the polarity, it's less likely that users will accidentally plug in the wrong connector, which could potentially cause damage to the device or even result in electrical shock.

But even with this reversed polarity, how can you be sure you're connecting the right terminals? The easiest way is to look for the tiny plus and minus symbols on the Dyson DC35 device itself – these will show you which terminal is positive and which is negative. Make sure the plus and minus symbols on the device match up with those on the adapter plug.

Alternatively, you can also use a voltmeter to check the polarity of the adapter plug before you plug it in. Using a voltmeter is a more precise way to check the polarity and will give you peace of mind knowing that you're connecting everything correctly.

So there you have it – the secret polarity of the Dyson DC35 AC DC Adapter Plug revealed! It may seem confusing at first, but with a little attention to detail and some careful checking, you can make sure you're connecting everything correctly and safely. Happy vacuuming!


## Chosen Solution
 AC/DC adapter for the DYSON DC35, what is the polarity of the plug?

 If you have the adapter you can test to see which blade of the plug is not powered.
Looking at a picture of the plug itself on the web I can see that the outer barrel of the adapter is (-) so using a continuity tester with one probe on the outer barrel, move between the 2 blades until you get a signal, that blade of the plug is neutral and the other will be positive giving you the polarity.
If you do not have the adapter you can attempt to match to the configuration shown in this photo or just buy a replacement.

 It appears to have two positive contacts. The center most pin is 16.75V+and the middle circle is 24.35V+, the outermost contact is negative
