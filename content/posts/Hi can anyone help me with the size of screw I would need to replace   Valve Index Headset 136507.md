STOP! Don't Replace Your Valve Index Headset Without Reading This First - The Surprising Size Screw You Need

If you are thinking of replacing your Valve Index Headset, then hold on just a minute! You might encounter a common problem that many users have faced while changing the headset. And that problem is the screw size!

Replacing the Valve Index Headset requires you to remove the old one first. However, most users face difficulty in removing the screw that secures the headset to the mount. And if you manage to remove it, you might not find the right size screw to fix the new one.

So, what is the surprising size screw you need to look out for while replacing the Valve Index Headset? Keep reading to find out.

The Valve Index Headset uses a 1/16 Allen wrench screw that holds the headset to the mount. This screw is relatively small and can be tough to remove if you do not have the right tool. Using a larger tool can damage the screw, making it more difficult to remove.

Additionally, when you are replacing the headset, you need to ensure that the screw size matches the one you removed. Many users make the mistake of assuming the screw size and end up with a loose or over-tightened screw, leading to other issues with the headset.

To avoid such issues, we recommend that you only use an appropriate 1/16 Allen wrench tool for removing the screw and ensure that the new headset comes with the same size screw. You can also purchase this size screw online if you do not have it.

If you are worried about removing the screw or replacing the headset and have no experience doing so, we suggest that you seek professional help. Many third-party repair services offer Valve Index Headset repair services, and they have the necessary tools and experience to ensure that the headset is mounted correctly.

In conclusion, before you replace your Valve Index Headset, ensure that you have the right tools and the proper screw size. Remember, using the incorrect tool or size screw can cause issues with your headset, leading to more significant problems in the future. Stay safe, and happy gaming!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi can anyone help me with screw size as mine have come out itâ€™s the part that holds the cable in place
Update (10/19/2022)

 katrinarobinson82 that is perfect. I would take the headset to my local hardware store. Mom and Pop hardware is still the best since the larger warehouse style hardware stores do not quite have the personal touch. Show them what you are looking for. Those will most likely by small metric threads. You can try the screws right there and get the size you need. The other places I would try are Jewellers, watchmakers and local RC and electronic clubs. Those people never throw anything out and you'll be surprised what you'll find.
Since those look like inserts, you can measure the hole with a pair of calipers to determine which size you will need. Local machine shops and technical colleges can help you with that as well.
