Desperate iMac Owner Searches High and Low for Mysterious SMC Chip Location - Can YOU Help Solve the Mystery?!

It's a tale as old as time - something goes wrong with your beloved piece of technology, and you frantically search the internet for solutions. That was the case for one iMac owner who found themselves in a bit of a sticky situation. They were experiencing issues with their machine, and they had heard that the SMC (System Management Controller) chip could be the root of the problem. They wanted to find it and try resetting it, but they had one major problem - they had no idea where to find it.

The search began. They scoured forum after forum, Google search after Google search, trying to find some information on the elusive SMC chip's location. But despite their best efforts, they were still left in the dark. Frustrated and at a loss, they turned to the internet community for help.

So, dear reader, we turn to you. Do you know where the SMC chip is located on an iMac? If so, you could be the one to solve this mystery and help this desperate iMac owner in their time of need.

Firstly, let's dive into what the SMC chip is and why it's so important. The SMC controls a variety of functions on an iMac, including power management, thermal management, and battery charging. Basically, it's a tiny piece of technology that has significant control over how your beloved iMac functions. It's no wonder then that if something goes wrong with the SMC chip, it can cause a whole host of issues that can make even the most tech-savvy person feel helpless.

So, where exactly is this all-important SMC chip located on an iMac? Well, if you have a newer model with a T2 chip, the SMC is integrated into that. But for older models, it's usually found on the logic board. It can be a little tricky to locate, but fear not, we are here to help.

If you have an iMac with an aluminum rear enclosure, the SMC chip will be located near the center of the logic board, towards the bottom of the machine. It'll be a tiny chip with eight pins arranged in a rectangle. If you have a plastic iMac model, it'll be located towards the left-hand side of the machine, again towards the bottom.

It's important to note that attempting to reset the SMC chip should only be done if you know what you're doing. If you're not confident in your ability to make repairs to your iMac or access the SMC chip, it's always best to seek professional help.

In conclusion, the search for the elusive SMC chip can be a frustrating one, but with a bit of determination and knowledge, it can be found. So, to our desperate iMac owner, we hope this information has been helpful in your quest to locate and reset the SMC chip. And to all our readers, remember that with the power of the internet and community, we can solve even the most puzzling of tech mysteries.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an issue with fan spinning when the iMac is shutdown. SMC and PRAM reseting does not help. From the forum, someone have similar problem with bad smc component on his imac 21”. But as the logicboard design is different than the iMac 27”. Anyone got a boardview so that I can locate the smc part, so that I can take a look if there is some bad component and check it for contuinity?
Update
The logicboard has a history of problems. There were a blown L4400 a 120 Ohm 3A fix inductor (ferrite bead) which I have replaced with new one. This fixed fan spinning while the iMac is on. Now the only problem is that it is on while the iMac is shutdown. Beside that the iMac have 2 defective ram slot. Not to mention a brokken glass screen. It is a problem child, but it works at least normally while it is on.

 Lets make sure we don’t fix things that aren’t broken ;-}
First did you run diagnostics? Restart your system  and press the D key
Reference: Mac startup key combinations. If your system fails to load diagnostics you’ll need to give TG Pro a try. Let us know what you get for an error and a snapshot of the main window of TG Pro with all of the sensors visible here for us to see Adding images to an existing question
