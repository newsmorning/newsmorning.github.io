PS4 Owners Beware: Roller Troubles in Your Disc Drive?! Here's How to Fix It!

If you're a proud PS4 owner, you might have faced the dreaded roller troubles in your disc drive. This problem is not uncommon for PS4 users, especially those who have been using their console for a while. The roller troubles can make it difficult or impossible to play your favorite games, and it can be frustrating to deal with. However, don't worry, because we have put together a guide on how to fix this problem. Keep reading to learn about the common causes and solutions.

Common Causes

A faulty roller mechanism is the most common cause of roller troubles in a PS4's disc drive. This is essentially a mechanical problem that prevents the rollers in the disc drive from spinning properly. The causes can vary, but typically these include dust accumulation, hair and debris, and wear and tear over time. Another common cause of roller troubles is a damaged laser lens, which affects the reading of the disc.

Potential Solutions

Fortunately, there are some simple fixes that you can try to rectify the roller troubles in your PS4's disc drive. 

Clean the Disc Drive

The first step to fixing roller troubles is to clean your PS4's disc drive. Over time, the drive can accumulate dust, hair, and debris that can interfere with the rollers' movement. To clean the drive, you can use a can of compressed air or a soft brush to gently remove dust and dirt. However, be careful not to apply too much pressure or force as this can damage the rollers.

Adjust Your PS4's Vertical Orientation

Another potential solution for roller troubles is to adjust the PS4's vertical orientation. If you have the console lying flat, try setting it up vertically instead. Sometimes, the gravity can affect the roller operation in the disc drive and cause roller troubles. By adjusting the position of your PS4, you could help the rollers spin more freely and smoothly.

Replace the Disc Drive

If you've tried cleaning your PS4's disc drive and adjusting its position to no avail, you might need to replace the disc drive altogether. This is a more advanced solution that involves opening up the console and replacing the internal mechanism responsible for the roller operation. While this solution requires more effort and technical know-how, it is an effective fix for persistent roller troubles. However, if you're not confident in taking apart your PS4, it's best to get it serviced by a professional.

Conclusion

Roller troubles in a PS4's disc drive can be frustrating, especially when you just want to sit down and play your favorite games. However, knowing the common causes and solutions to this problem can help you save time and money. By cleaning your disc drive, adjusting your PS4's vertical orientation, or replacing the disc drive, you can get your PS4 working as good as new and be back to your gaming routine in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 My disc rollers are not going away and the disc gets stuck and does not show up as an unrecognized disc also. The disc remains tilted inside the console and the laser does not read. Help anyone??

 The disc rollers may have been knocked out of alignment, or may be dirty. Try taking it apart and clean/replace the broken part.

 Make sure the two rollers are clipped into place with the little white plastic piece between them allowing both the rollers to move together.
The rollers should be able to be pushed down on both sides. Try sanding down the rollers as if they are too smooth from wear it will not have a good grip on the disc for feeding it into the drive.
There is also a spring for moving the gearing back and forth, try moving it with your hands it should open with friction and it should close by itself if the springs are fine.
