It is a Grass type Pokemon that evolves into Lilligant. Petilil is a cute, small, and green Pokemon with leaves on the top of the head. It is found in various locations in Pokemon games, and Pokemon Scarlet Violet is not different. However, the interesting fact is that Petilil is hiding in a different location than in other games.\nIn Pokemon Scarlet Violet, Petilil is hiding in the Secret Grove. The Secret Grove is a hidden area that can be accessed after completing the main story. It is located in the eastern part of the region, and it is easily missable. Once you find the Secret Grove, explore it, and you’ll find Petilil hiding in the bushes. It is interesting to note that Petilil is not easy to spot, especially if you are not paying attention. Therefore, look around carefully, and you might find it!\nBesides being a cute and interesting Pokemon, finding Petilil has some advantages in Pokemon Scarlet Violet. Firstly, catching Petilil will complete your Pokedex. Secondly, it is a good addition to your team as it has various Grass type moves such as Mega Drain, Leech Seed, and Energy Ball.

So, if you are playing Pokemon Scarlet Violet, don’t forget to visit the Secret Grove and find Petilil in the bushes!\nPetilil is one of the many creatures who is making its return in Pokemon Scarlet \u0026 Violet. It is otherwise also known as the ‘Bulb Pokemon’. It is a very useful Grass type Pokemon with its abilities like Chlorophyll, Own Tempo and also a hidden ability called Leaf Guard. If you want this little creature on your team but don’t know how to find it, we’ll help. Here’s the location of Petilil in Pokemon Scarlet \u0026 Violet.\nWhere to Find Petilil in Pokemon Scarlet \u0026 Violet Petilil’s name is derived from the word ‘Petal’ and ‘Lily’. The name itself gives a hint of its location. You can find this Pokemon near flowers which might make you wonder, ‘aren’t there flowers all over Paldea?’ Well, it’s not that simple.\nOn the Pokedex, it is specified that Petilil can be found in Western Paldea. However, we found it spawning at several other locations in Pokemon Scarlet \u0026 Violet apart from that. The Bulb Pokemon can also be found in:\nSouth Province Area Two South Province Area Four South Province Area Six Casseroya Lake North Province (Area Three) Catching Petilil is relatively easy. You can do so by simply using a Quick Ball. After getting Petilil added to your Pokedex, you can also transform it into its next form. The Grass type creature can evolve into Lilligant. However, you won’t need to level up to complete its transformation. To evolve Petilil, all you need is a Sun Stone. However, finding these is very difficult. Once you get your hands on one, you simply have to use it on Petilil to evolve it into Lilligant. This is a much more powerful Pokemon which is why you need to complete the evolution as soon as possible.\nThat’s everything covered on the location of Petilil in Pokemon Scarlet \u0026 Violet.
