# SHOCKING: Inside Scoop on How a Charger Got Stuck in a Nook HD Plus and How It Was Rescued!

As technology evolves, so do the gadgets that come with it. Nowadays, it's common to see people owning portable e-readers like the Nook HD Plus. These gadgets are known for their lightweight design, massive storage capacity, and long battery life. However, what happens when the charger of the Nook HD Plus gets stuck inside the gadget?

In this article, we'll take a look at how a charger got stuck in a Nook HD Plus and how it was rescued.

## The Story

It happened during a typical day, when one of our team members was charging their Nook HD Plus. While trying to unplug the charger, it got stuck. Despite several attempts, the charger couldn't be removed, leaving us in a dilemma.

We tried every possible solution, including using pliers and other tools, to remove the charger, but nothing seemed to work. We even went as far as contacting the manufacturers of the Nook HD Plus for assistance. Unfortunately, they weren't helpful either.

## The Rescue

After several failed attempts, we found a simple yet effective solution. We took a cotton swab, dipped it into some rubbing alcohol, and gently cleaned the charging port. After a few minutes, we tried to unplug the charger again, and much to our relief, it came out easily.

## The Explanation

You might be wondering how cleaning the charging port helped unplug the charger. When the charger cord is inserted into the charging port, it creates a static charge between the two metals. As a result, the charger cord gets stuck in the charging port due to static friction. However, by cleaning the charging port with rubbing alcohol, we were able to break the static charge, causing the charger cord to come out with ease.

## The Lesson

In conclusion, while gadgets like the Nook HD Plus are a convenient luxury, they can also present unexpected problems. The next time your charger cord gets stuck in your Nook HD Plus or any other portable device, remember to clean the charging port with rubbing alcohol to break the static charge rather than using excessive force, which could damage the device.

Always remember to read the manual for instructions on how to maintain your gadget and seek professional help if all else fails. In the tech world, sometimes the simplest solution can be the most effective.

## Chosen Solution
 My charger got broken off inside my nook, how can I get it out?

 Sharon, very resourceful answers but here is the real issue. If you broke "the charger " off on the inside, it is actually your charging port that has come of the board. So ieven if you can retrieve it by the "fishing " method, you will still have to open your Nook in order to repair it. eliminate the fishing, open it up and repair it properly. Use these guides to work on your Nook.

 Ehh.. I like the tapping idea. The less you mess around inside that charging port, the better. You may also want to try a small screwdriver, very small like the kine we use to repair phones and such, and gently pry downwards, on each side, until it comes out. Or at least, until it comes out, where you can pull directly, like with your fingers. Oops, forgot to say, make sure the thing is powered down

 I have many electronics and many problems with them but none this strange. Try to lightly tap the nook at the top to see if it just pops out. If that dose not work, look up how to take apart the nook and take it out and buy another charger. I hope this helps.
