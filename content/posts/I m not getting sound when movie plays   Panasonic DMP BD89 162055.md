Muffled or low sound: If you're experiencing muffled or low sound on your Panasonic Dmp Bd89, the first thing you should check is the volume.

By making these changes, you can resolve the no-sound error.

Distorted audio: Sometimes, the sound may become distorted due to several reasons. One of the primary reasons could be a dirty or damaged disc. Ensure that your disc is clean and free of any scratches. If the disc isn't the problem, ensure that your audio settings are correct. Check whether the audio is set to different formats, which may cause distortion in the audio. By checking on these aspects, you can resolve audio distortion.
