# Is the Infinix Zero 6 the Ultimate Smartphone? Find Out What We Love and Hate About It!

Infinix has become a prominent name in the smartphone industry with their budget-friendly devices that offer impressive features. The Infinix Zero 6 is one of their latest offerings in the market, which boasts some high-end features that can give tough competition to expensive smartphones. But, is it the ultimate smartphone? Let’s dive into what we love and hate about it to find out!

## What We Love

### Display

The Infinix Zero 6 comes with a 6.18-inch Full HD+ display that offers vibrant colors and a bright output. It has a resolution of 1080 x 2246 pixels that makes the display sharp and clear. The slim bezels around the edge of the display add to the modern look of the smartphone.

### Camera

The Infinix Zero 6 has a dual-camera setup on the back, which includes a 24-megapixel primary sensor and a 12-megapixel secondary sensor. The camera produces sharp and detailed images and performs well in low-light settings.

### Battery

The Infinix Zero 6 is backed by a 3650mAh battery, which provides ample battery life for a full day of usage. Additionally, it comes with fast charging support, allowing you to charge the battery quickly.

### Performance

The Infinix Zero 6 is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, which is coupled with 6GB of RAM. This combination ensures smooth performance and lag-free multitasking. The smartphone runs on Android 8.1 Oreo, which offers a clean and user-friendly interface.

### Price

One of the biggest advantages of the Infinix Zero 6 is its price tag. Considering the features it offers, the smartphone comes at a pocket-friendly price that makes it an affordable option for people who want to experience high-end features without breaking the bank.

## What We Hate

### Design

Although the Infinix Zero 6 has a modern and sleek look, the glass rear panel with a glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet. It gets smudged quickly and requires frequent cleaning. Additionally, the smartphone is quite bulky and may not be comfortable to hold for long periods.

### Software Updates

Infinix is known for providing regular software updates, but the Infinix Zero 6 only comes with Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. The company has not yet announced whether the smartphone will receive the latest Android updates.

### Limited Availability

The Infinix Zero 6 is only available in a few countries, which could make it difficult to purchase for people living in other regions.

## Verdict

Overall, the Infinix Zero 6 offers some impressive features that make it a great smartphone in its price range. It has a vibrant display, a great camera, a powerful processor, and ample battery life. However, it does have some downsides such as a bulky design and limited availability. Despite these drawbacks, the Infinix Zero 6 is still a solid choice for someone looking for a smartphone that offers high-end features without the hefty price tag.

If there is anything to be proud of Infinix Mobility about, it’s got to be the company’s consistency. With just over 5 years in the smartphone ecosystem, the Infinix brands have released a handful of smartphones of different models and under numerous series/categories.
 
The latest product from the brand is the newly-announced Infinix Zero 6 and Zero 6 Pro, both of which are successors to the Infinix Zero 5 and Zero 5 Pro. The devices are the latest flagships from the Chinese OEM and the newest addition to the company’s Zero Series. Albeit pre-order dates and prices for the devices have been announced, not all the feature were announced, at least extensively. And heck (as at the time of concocting this piece), there are no details or product pages for the flagship devices on the company’s official website.
 
However, from the available features we have at hand, we proceed to highlight some things we like about Infinix’s latest flagship device as well as some other things we think the company could have done better.
 
PS: You can expect to see a redefined sequel to this article perhaps when we spend quality hands-on time reviewing the device(s).
 
## Infinix Zero 6: What we like
 
The Shooters!
 
Devices from the ‘Zero’ series almost always have the best cameras when compared to Infinx phones from other series. The new Infinix Zero 6 isn’t any different either. In fact, this might just be the best camera on an Infinix device, ever! The Zero 6 will launch with a dual camera set-up on the rear with 24-megapixels and 12MP primary and secondary lens respectively.
 
Now, these lenses are no ordinary lenses as they have powerful AI software in place to enhance picture quality and do a lot more. For example, the Zero 6’s camera software allows the device identify scenes and subjects (like food, plants, sport, sunrise, sunset etc) when capturing images, thereby optimizing the camera settings to produce the best image quality depending on the scene or object you’re capturing.
 
Some other standout features of the Zero 6’s camera like 4-in-1 Low Light technology, Slow Motion support for video capture, as well as Google Lens & Assistant integration are some of the things we also love about the device. In fact, it is why the device would most likely trump the Tecno Camon C11 Pro.
 
The 24-megapixels front-facing camera of the Zero 6 also supports ‘AI Beauty’. Infinix calls it “The camera that is intelligent”. True, the specs (on paper) look promising and ‘intelligent’ but we’d wait to find out when the device hits stores.
 
That Glassy Gloss
 
While we had previously expressed our disappointment with Infinix’s decision to jump on the cliche “notched-display-with-dual-camera-and-rear-fingerprint” design bandwagon, we cannot deny that the glass covering on the rear is beautiful and improves the premiumness ranking of the device. It’s the first member of the “Zero” series to have Corning Gorilla Glass on the front and rear.
 
Overall though, the aesthetical appearance of the Zero 6 is mundane…and we think Infinix could have done better.
 
Gradient Skin
 
Although this also isn’t a unique feature, it is interesting to see Infinix hop on the trend. The Infinix Zero 6 will launch in two different colour variants (Milan Black and Sapphire Cyan) but only the latter comes with a gradient skin.
 
## What could have been better
 
A plate of Pie
 
Originally, the Infinix Zero 6 was supposed to launch Q4 last year. There were a lot of reasons why we thought Infinix held back the flagship, and one of them was that, perhaps, the OEM had plans to release the device with the latest Android 9 Pie out-of-the-box. Sadly, the device will debut with Android 8.1 Oreo, with the promise of an Android 9 OTA later in the future.
 
Android Pie out-of-the-box would have been super awesome! Also, it’d have made the delay more worthwhile.
 
Battery
 
The Zero 6 and zero 6 Pro will ship with 3,570mAh and 3,650mAh battery respectively. These are decent battery capacities, but the Camon C11 Pro sports a 3,750mAh battery backup. And to think the Zero 6 Pro (Ksh 31,999) costs Ksh 8,000 more than the Camon C11 Pro (Ksh 23,999), the battery could have been better; at least 4,000mAh.
 
The Zero 6 and Zero 6 Pro could have made it to our list of best Infinix smartphones for 2018 but they weren’t released last year. Now, however, that the flagships have been launched, they currently are the best (and priciest) devices from Infinix ever! Again, the devices have only been announced and are not available for retail yet. When they are, we’d come up with a more comprehensive review and list.
 
But for now, these are the aspects of the flagship devices that we like and dislike. Any thoughts?
