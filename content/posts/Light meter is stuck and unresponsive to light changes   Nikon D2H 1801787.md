Title: Is Your Nikon D2H Light Meter Failing You? See How To Fix It Now!

Introduction:
The Nikon D2H is a favorite camera among professional photographers due to its exceptional features, including autofocusing, noise-free images, and robust construction. However, after prolonged use, the camera's light meter might fail. The light meter plays a crucial role in determining the perfect exposure, and failure can significantly affect the quality of your images. In this article, we'll discuss how to diagnose the problem with your Nikon D2H light meter and offer tips on how to fix it.

Diagnosing the Problem:
The first step in fixing your Nikon D2H's light meter is diagnosing the problem accurately. If the light meter is failing, you'll notice that your exposures are either overexposed or underexposed. This is because the light meter isn't accurately measuring the available light, leading to incorrect exposure settings. If you notice such issues, it's recommended that you test the light meter's accuracy using a handheld light meter, as this will help you know the extent of the problem.

Fixing the Nikon D2H Light Meter:
Once you've diagnosed the problem with your Nikon D2H's light meter, fixing it is a relatively easy process. Firstly, ensure that the battery is fully charged, as the light meter might fail due to low battery power. Secondly, check the camera's firmware version and update it to the latest version, as this will ensure that the camera functions optimally. Another fix is to calibrate the light meter using a gray card, which will help to reset any inconsistencies in the meter's readings.

An alternative solution to fixing the light meter is to use manual exposure settings to adjust the exposure manually rather than relying on the camera’s automatic systems. This is especially useful when the ambient lighting conditions are problematic, such as in intense backlight, and the light meter’s readings are insufficient. To do this, activate the camera’s manual mode with the Mode Dial and adjust the aperture and shutter speed settings manually, based on the scene in front of you. It is crucial to note that using the manual settings requires a lot of practice, and may not be suitable for fast-moving objects or in dynamic environments.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Nikon D2H is an exceptional camera that requires periodic maintenance to ensure its optimal functioning. If you notice a problem with your camera's light meter, there's no need to panic. The above tips can significantly assist in diagnosing and fixing the problem promptly. Overall, be sure to check the battery, firmware, calibrate using a gray card, and practice using manual exposure settings, and you'll most certainly experience an improvement in your photography experience.

## Chosen Solution
 I got this Nikon D2H on eBay,
I wasn't expecting much, but it's in really good condition and everything works,
except for the Light Metering, I tried every option, reset, firmware update, settings, whatever. I shoot with D7100 so I am familiar with DSLRs. Simple settings and reset doesn't resolve the problem.
The issue is that the light meter doesn't change with the light in the scene, it doesn't change at all, it just stays at one point that it "thinks" that the metering is correct, so I can change the S or F or ISO to make a "correct exposure", but that exposure is just something that is stuck, has nothing to do with the subject or scene I am shooting.
I read online that this problem is a manufacturer malfunction, but the camera is old and Nikon won't even advise on which part to replace to fix this issue.
Can anyone advise?
Thanks

 This is important, because whether you’re able to meter or not, if there’s a problem of light leakage, your images are going to turn out pretty weird. So, as Lachman suggests, go into the shower, close the shower curtains, switch off the lights, and check for light leaks. How are you going to check for light leaks without light? Use a flashlight! In any case, if your camera is susceptible to light leaks, and checking does not reveal anything apparent, taping it would be a good idea. Hope this can help you . If still same exits then check Nikon D7100 Manual for help.
