# Is Your iPhone 4S Screen Driving You Crazy? Find Out the Ultimate Solution Now!

If you are an iPhone 4S user, you might have noticed how frustrating it can be when your screen starts acting weird. The screen might freeze, not respond to touch, or show strange lines and patterns. This issue is not uncommon, and many iPhone 4S users face it. However, the good news is that you don't have to suffer through it. In this article, we will discuss the ultimate solution to this problem.

**What Causes the iPhone 4S Screen Issue?**

Before we delve into the solution, it's essential to understand what causes such issues in the first place. The iPhone 4S screen issue is typically caused by a malfunctioning digitizer. The digitizer is responsible for sensing the touch input on your phone's screen. When it malfunctions, you may experience issues like unresponsive touch, ghost touches, or lines and patterns on the screen.

**The Ultimate Solution: Replace the Digitizer**

The only surefire solution to this issue is to replace the iPhone 4S digitizer. Here are the steps to follow:

Step 1: Purchase a Replacement Digitizer

To replace the digitizer, you will need to buy a replacement part. You can order it online or find it at a local phone repair shop.

Step 2: Gather the Necessary Tools

To replace the digitizer, you will need specific tools, such as a pentalobe screwdriver, a heat gun or hairdryer, a suction cup, and a plastic pry tool.

Step3: Disassemble and Remove the Old Digitizer

Start by turning off the iPhone and removing the back cover. Then, remove the two screws holding the battery connector in place and disconnect the connector. Next, remove the eight screws holding the metal plate in place and then lift the plate. You will see the digitizer connector, which you should unplug, and then remove the old digitizer using a plastic pry tool.

Step 4: Install the Replacement Digitizer

Heat the surface of the iPhone's screen using a heat gun or hairdryer, and then use a suction cup to pull the old digitizer up. Once it's detached, remove any remaining adhesive or glass shards. Then, place the new digitizer in place and reconnect the connector. Secure the digitizer using adhesive, and then reassemble the iPhone.

**Conclusion**

If your iPhone 4S screen is driving you crazy, there's no need to panic. By following the steps mentioned earlier, you can easily replace the malfunctioning digitizer and restore your phone's touchscreen capabilities. However, it's essential to note that the process requires some level of technical expertise, and if you're not confident, it's best to seek the help of a professional.

By replacing the digitizer, you can save your time and money rather than buying a whole new iPhone or going for complex phone repair procedures. So, don't let a malfunctioning screen ruin your iPhone experience, take action and restore it back to its glory!

## Chosen Solution
 My iPhone 4S is a little battered and is quite smashed, but is still working near enough perfectly, maybe a little slow. But today the screen went crazy, the colours look inverted (but it hasn't been inverted through the settings). Things I go on stay on the screen and take a while to fade away.

In the photo, that page of my phone only has one folder (the one in the top corner), yet the image of my other apps from the page before are still there after I had swiped across. PLEASE HELP!!

 Check the connections from the lcd to the logic board for error, one slight misplace on either the backlight or LCD connector can cause display issues. In the event the connectors are perfectly set and there are no signs of debris or interference, soft reset the device. If after these few steps you are still experiencing issues, you may have a defective LCD.

 Unless you have good engineer skills or basic wiring and tech knowledge of an iphone4s I would say bring it to a repair shop,
