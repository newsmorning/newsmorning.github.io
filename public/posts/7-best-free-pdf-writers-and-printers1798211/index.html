CutePDF Writer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-cutepdf-writer-1>#</a></h4><p>CutePDF Writer is an easy to use PDF writer and printer that allows you to add comments, create booklets and interactive form fields, stylized text stamps and more.</p><p>The app offers 128-bit AES security to encrypt your PDF file and restrict access from unauthorized users so that only you can access, edit, print and extract the content. If you want to edit a PDF though, you can still use the CutePDF Editor from your web browser.</p><p>Plus, you can convert printable documents to professional quality PDFs, and print your files by selecting CutePDF Writer from your list of printers on your PC.</p><p>The app only works with Windows (Vista to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2008-2019), and you need an additional free postscript to PDF driver to create PDFs.</p><h4 id=6-bullzip-pdf-printer>6. BullZip PDF Printer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-bullzip-pdf-printer>#</a></h4><p>BullZip PDF printer is a free PDF printer, which means you can use its free version but with certain limitations. However, the app doesnâ€™t contain pop ups or ads, and if you need advanced features, you can always go for its commercial application, which removes the 10 user limit in the free version.</p><p>With the BullZip PDF printer, you can write PDF documents from Windows programs, control whether you want to see the resulting PDF document and password protect your PDFs.</p><p>The app offers 128/256 bit AES encryption to add security to your PDFs, and you can edit it to add watermark text and sign PDF documents using digital certificates. Plus, BullZip PDF printer supports multiple output types including PNG, JPEG, BMP, PCX, PDF and TIFF.</p><h4 id=7-dopdf>7. doPDF<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-dopdf>#</a></h4><p>If you just need a PDF printer app, doPDF is a solid choice.</p><p>The free PDF printer app creates PDF files and allows you to convert printable files to PDFs. The app installs as a virtual PDF printer driver and you can print to PDF without downloading malware or other random add-ons.</p><p>You can convert PDFs to DOCX, PPTX, HTML or TXT files and print them out, or convert Microsoft Office documents into PDFs for printing or web publishing based on your needs.</p><p>The main downside with doPDF is that you canâ€™t write or edit using the app; itâ€™s just for printing or converting printable files or images to PDFs.</p><h2 id=quickly-edit-and-print-pdfs>Quickly Edit and Print PDFs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#quickly-edit-and-print-pdfs>#</a></h2><p>There are so many tools you can use to write or print to PDF, making it difficult to select one. If youâ€™re just looking for a simple tool, you can use the built-in Microsoft Print to PDF service in Windows 10. For macOS users, turn to our step-by-step guide on how to edit PDFs on Mac.</p><p>Do you have a favorite PDF writer or printer tool?
