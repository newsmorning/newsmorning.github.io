Unlock the Secrets of Little Nightmares 2: The Ultimate Collectible Guide to Finding the Hospital Key Revealed!

Little Nightmares 2 is a horror video game that has taken the gaming world by storm. Players from all over the world have been thrilled and scared by its eerie atmosphere and puzzles that need solving to progress. The game follows the journey of Mono and Six, two little children trapped in a world full of nightmarish creatures and obstacles. In this article, we’ll be discussing the ultimate collectible guide to finding the hospital key in Little Nightmares 2.

The hospital level is an unsettling and creepy part of the game, full of dangers lurking around every corner. It is also home to one of the most sought-after collectibles, the hospital key. This key gives players access to a locked door with important items inside. However, finding the key can be quite tricky, but fear not! We've got you covered.

Firstly, it is essential to know that the hospital level is divided into two parts: the basement and upper levels. Finding the key requires players to explore both sections carefully. It can be found in the upper level of the hospital, so players must focus on exploring that area more.

To reach the upper level, players must climb the stairs leading to the elevator, but it is not that simple. The stairs are broken and appear to be incomplete, leading players to have to find an alternate path. A box can be found on the basement level that can be pushed to the wall leading to the upper level. Players can then use the box as a stepping stool to climb to the upper level.

Once players have reached the upper level, they must navigate through the maze of dark corridors and rooms that litter the area. Along the way, several puzzles require solving to progress, and by doing so, players can obtain some of the game's collectibles. However, none are as important as the hospital key.

The key is concealed in a room located on the left side of the upper level, just before a dead end. The door leading to the room is locked, but there is a way to get through it. To do so, players must activate a button located in one of the other rooms, leading to the door's unlocking.

Finding the button is not as easy as it sounds, and it requires players to use their observational skills. The button can be observed by looking through a small gap located in the room adjacent to the locked door. Players can crouch and peek through the opening to spot the glowing button on the other side.

Once the button has been located, players must navigate through a variety of obstacles to reach it. These include dodging security cameras, crawling through vents, and avoiding lethal traps. When the button has been activated, the door leading to the key room is unlocked, and players can obtain the hospital key.

In conclusion, finding the hospital key in Little Nightmares 2 is not an easy task, but it is critical to progressing through the game. Players must explore the upper level of the hospital, solve puzzles, and use their observational skills to locate the button that unlocks the door leading to the key. By following these steps, players will be one step closer to achieving victory in this thrilling and terrifying game.

## How To Find The Hospital Key In Little Nightmares 2?
 
The Hospital Level is a really creepy level in the game. The scenes are quite morbid and the low lighting doesn’t help whatsoever. Anyone would want to get out of this level as soon as possible because of the scenario. When you reach the Hospital you will have to tune the transmission which will teleport you to another room.
 
In this new area, you will have to find the Key to unlock the door upstairs. You have to walk all the way to the X-Ray room which is to the right and keep going in that general direction.
 
### The Key in the Toys
 
Once you enter the room you have to look around until you see the X-Rays put up on the wall. On the wall, you will notice the X-Ray of a stuffed animal. The X-Ray indicates that the Stuffed Animal has eaten a key at some point.
 
You will see two stuffed animals over there. We suggest using the facilities at your disposal and X-Raying both these toys in the X-Ray machine. Now that you have figured out which toy has the key, take it out of the room and into the freight elevator. You will reach the floor where the incinerator is located.
 
All that remains between you and the key now is the toy and you just have to throw the toy into the incinerator. Once you have thrown the toy inside flip the switch and let it burn. Once it’s dust all you have to do is go in and collect the key, after you have turned the incinerator off. Now you can go back to the door upstairs and unlock it. You can continue with the next level now.
 
This was everything you had to know about how to get the Hospital Key in Little Nightmares 2. Also, have a look at how to change hats or how to destroy obstacles.
