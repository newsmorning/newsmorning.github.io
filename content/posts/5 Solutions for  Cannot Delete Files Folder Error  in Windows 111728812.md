# Windows 11 Users Rejoice: Learn 5 Game-Changing Solutions to Finally Fix 'Cannot Delete Files' Error for Good!

As a Windows 11 user, have you ever encountered the error message "Cannot Delete Files"? It's a frustrating experience to be unable to delete a file or folder, despite multiple attempts. But worry no more, as we have gathered 5 effective solutions to help you fix this error for good.

## Solution 1: Restart your PC

Sometimes, the quickest solution is the most effective. Restart your system and try deleting the file or folder again. This can help in resolving any system glitches or errors that may be causing the issue.

## Solution 2: Use Safe Mode

If the problem persists even after restarting your PC, try booting into Safe Mode. In Safe Mode, Windows only loads the essential drivers and services, leaving out third-party applications that may be causing the error. To enable Safe Mode, press F8 while your PC is booting up and select the Safe Mode option.

## Solution 3: Use Task Manager

If a file or folder is being used by a running application, you may not be able to delete it. To check if a file or folder is open in a running application, open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc), go to the Processes tab, and look for any process that may be using the file or folder in question. If you find such a process, select it and click the End Process button to terminate it. After closing the application, you should be able to delete the file or folder.

## Solution 4: Use Command Prompt

You can also try to delete the file or folder using Command Prompt. Open Command Prompt as an Administrator (right-click and select "Run as Administrator"), and type the command "del /f filename" (without the quotation marks), followed by the Enter key. Replace "filename" with the name of the file or folder you want to delete. This will force delete the file or folder.

## Solution 5: Use Third-Party Software

Finally, if none of the above solutions work, you can use third-party software like Unlocker, FileAssassin, or IObit Unlocker. These tools are designed to help delete files or folders that cannot be deleted using the built-in Windows options. Simply download and install the software, right-click on the file or folder you want to delete, and select the option to delete it using the third-party software.

In conclusion, the "Cannot Delete Files" error can be a frustrating experience, but with these five solutions, you should be able to resolve the issue and delete the problematic files or folders. Give these solutions a try and enjoy a smoother and more efficient Windows 11 experience.
