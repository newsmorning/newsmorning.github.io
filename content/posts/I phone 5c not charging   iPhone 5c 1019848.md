If you are an iPhone 5C user, you may have faced the problem of your device not charging. This can be an annoying and frustrating issue, especially if you rely heavily on your iPhone for day-to-day activities. But fear not - there's a quick fix you can try right now!

## Check for Visible Damage

Firstly, it's important to check your iPhone for any visible damage. Look for cracks or dents in the charging port or cable. If you see any damage, that could be the issue. If this is the case, you may need to replace the charging cable or port.

## Clean the Charging Port

Sometimes, the charging port can become clogged with dirt, dust, or lint, which can prevent the charger from functioning properly. To clean the charging port, take a toothpick or cotton swab and gently remove any debris that may be trapped inside. Be careful not to damage the port or any other components.

## Restart Your iPhone

If your iPhone isn't charging, a simple restart may do the trick. Press and hold the power button until the "slide to power off" message appears. Slide to power off, wait a few seconds, then press and hold the power button again to turn your iPhone back on. Once it's powered up, connect it to the charger and see if it starts charging.

## Choose the Right Charger

Using the wrong charger can also cause charging issues. Make sure you're using an Apple-approved charger and cable, as third-party chargers may not be compatible with your iPhone, leading to charging issues.

## Reset Your iPhone

If your iPhone is still not charging, resetting it might help. To reset your iPhone, press and hold both the power button and home button simultaneously for about 10 seconds or until the Apple logo appears. Once it restarts, try charging it again and see if the issue has been resolved.

## Contact Apple Support

If none of the above fixes worked, it's possible that there could be a deeper issue with your iPhone. In this case, it's best to contact Apple support or go to an Apple store for assistance.

In conclusion, if your iPhone 5C is refusing to charge, don't panic. There are several quick fixes you can try before resorting to getting it repaired or replaced. If none of the above fixes work, it's best to contact Apple support or go to an Apple store to resolve the issue, so you can start enjoying your iPhone again.

## Chosen Solution
 I changed the battery and changed the lighting plug.  But phone still will not charge. When I changed the battery the phone worked fine. Just will not charge. Getting antenna to reconnect took a lot of time as well. Still not sure it's secure. Any help or advice would be appreciated.

 I would make sure that you have a good part and try charging the phone while it is powered off. You have to make sure that the battery you have in it will power up the phone then shut it off and try to charge it. If that does not work I regret to inform you that this is a common problem with the 5,5c,5s. There is a small IC chip on the board that can be popped if you use a non-apple cable and there is no repair as far as my skill set goes however I would check out Cyberdocllc.com and see if it is something they offer.
Hope this helps!!
