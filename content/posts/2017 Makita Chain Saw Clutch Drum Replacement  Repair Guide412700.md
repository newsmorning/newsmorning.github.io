Title: You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Replace Your Makita Chain Saw Clutch Drum in 2017 - Our Ultimate Repair Guide Will Blow Your Mind!

Introduction

If you're a chainsaw user, you know how important it is to keep your machine in good working condition. There are many parts to look after on your chainsaw, and one of the most important is the clutch drum. It's not uncommon for this part to wear out or break over time, but the good news is that replacing it is a lot easier than you might think. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of replacing the clutch drum on your Makita chainsaw, step-by-step. You'll be amazed at how simple it is when you follow our instructions!

Step 1: Tools You'll Need

Before you get started, you'll need to make sure you have the right tools on hand. Here's what you'll need:

- Makita clutch drum replacement kit
- Socket wrench
- Screwdrivers (Phillips and flat)
- Ignition spark plug tester
- Gloves
- Safety glasses

Make sure to wear your gloves and safety glasses during the entire process.

Step 2: Remove the Spark Plug

The first step is to remove the spark plug. This will prevent the chainsaw from accidentally starting during the repair process. Use the ignition spark plug tester to check for any electrical discharge before starting work on the chainsaw.

Step 3: Remove the Clutch

Next, you'll need to remove the clutch assembly. Use a socket wrench to loosen the clutch bolt, but don't remove it completely just yet. Instead, place a cloth over the chain brake and use a flat-head screwdriver to jam the saw chain. This will keep the clutch from turning while you remove the clutch bolt.

Once the clutch bolt is removed, pull the clutch assembly away from the chainsaw. Be sure to carefully remove the washer and any other components attached to the clutch assembly.

Step 4: Remove the Old Drum

Now it's time to remove the old clutch drum. Use a socket wrench to remove the bolts securing it to the chainsaw's crankshaft. Then, slide the old drum off the crankshaft.

Step 5: Install the New Drum

With the old drum removed, it's time to install the replacement clutch drum. Align it with the crankshaft and screw the bolts back into place. Use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts to the manufacturer's specifications.

Step 6: Reinstall the Clutch

Once the new clutch drum is installed, it's time to reattach the clutch assembly. Position the assembly over the drum and secure it in place with the clutch bolt. Use a socket wrench to tighten the clutch bolt, again to the manufacturer's specification.

Step 7: Reinstall the Spark Plug

Lastly, reinstall the spark plug. Take out the ignition spark plug tester and screw the spark plug back into place, making sure not to overtighten it.

Conclusion

Congratulations, you've replaced the clutch drum on your Makita chainsaw! With a bit of patience and care, you can keep your chainsaw in top condition and enjoy years of reliable use. Follow our guide and you'll be amazed at how simple it is to take care of this vital part of your chainsaw.
