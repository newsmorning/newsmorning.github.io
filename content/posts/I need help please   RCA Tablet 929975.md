# I Thought I Knew How To Use My RCA Tablet, But This One Thing Had Me Stuck - Can You Help Me?

As someone who has been using technology for years, I thought that I could easily figure out how to use my RCA tablet. However, I came across one thing that had me stuck and frustrated. I could not seem to get the hang of the split-screen feature on my RCA tablet. It seemed like a simple concept, but there was something that I wasn't doing right. If you are struggling with the same issue, then here are some tips that can help you.

The split-screen feature on an RCA tablet allows you to use two apps at the same time. For example, you can have a web browser open on one side of the screen while you use a note-taking app on the other side. To use the split-screen feature, you must first have both apps open that you want to multitask with. Once you have the apps open, you need to drag one of the app windows to the top of the screen. When you do this, you'll notice a blue border surround that window. Hold down the window, and then drag it to one side of the screen.

Now, you will see that the screen is split in half, with one app taking up the left side, and the other app on the right. If you want to change the size of the apps, just drag the line dividing the two apps to the left or right. If you want to close one of the apps, then all that you have to do is drag the dividing line all the way to one side of the screen.

One tip that might help you is to make sure you're on the right version of Android. For example, some RCA tablets come with version 6.0, Marshmallow, or 7.0, Nougat. The instructions for using the split-screen feature are slightly different depending on the version of Android that you're using. So make sure that you're looking at the right instructions for your tablet.

Another tip is to make sure that your tablet is fully updated. This can help resolve any issues that you may be having with the split-screen feature. To check for updates, go to "Settings," and then scroll down to "About Tablet," and then tap on "System Updates."

Finally, if you're still having trouble with the split-screen feature, then you might want to consider resetting your tablet. This will restore the tablet to its default settings and can help resolve any issues that you may be having. To reset your tablet, go to "Settings," scroll down to "Backup & reset," and then tap on "Factory data reset." Keep in mind that resetting your tablet will erase all data, so be sure to back up any important files before you proceed.

In conclusion, the split-screen feature on an RCA tablet can be a powerful tool for multitasking. If you're having trouble using this feature, then follow these tips and tricks to help you get the hang of it. With a little patience and persistence, you'll be using the split-screen feature on your RCA tablet like a pro in no time.

Hi my table is not working and i need to be fixed the screen is mess up come

 Latia Jenkins that would make your tablet a RCT6303W87DK model. If you need to replace the LCD check this video. You can get a replacement for the LCD at places like this and others as well. You most likely would also need a new digitizer. Post an image of what you see on your screen with your question. For that use this guide so we can see what you are looking at. There is always a possibility that it is not your display but something more sinister on the logicboard.
