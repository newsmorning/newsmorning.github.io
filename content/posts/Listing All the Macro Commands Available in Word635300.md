# Unlock the Hidden Power of Microsoft Word with these Top Secret Macro Commands!

Most people use Microsoft Word as a basic word processing tool, only utilizing a fraction of its full potential. However, unknown to many, Microsoft Word is equipped with a powerful feature known as Macros that can automate many time-consuming tasks and improve productivity. In this article, we’ll explore some of the top secret macro commands that can unlock the hidden power of Microsoft Word.

## What are Macros?

In simple terms, Macros in Word are sets of instructions that automate repetitive tasks. You can think of them as mini-programs that allow you to save time and energy by automating tasks like formatting, editing, and spell-checking. You can record Macros that replicate the task you want to automate, and then quickly play them back with a click of a button.

## How to Use Macros in Microsoft Word

To use Macros in Microsoft Word, you need to enable the Developer tab in the Ribbon. Here’s how:

1. Open Word and click on the File tab.
2. Click on Options, and then choose Customize Ribbon.
3. In the right-hand pane, check the box next to Developer, and then click OK.

Once you have enabled the Developer tab, you can access the Macros dialog box by clicking on it.

## Top Secret Macro Commands

1. AutoText: If you frequently use certain phrases or words, you can save them as AutoText. To do this, select the text you want to save, click on the Quick Access Toolbar, and choose AutoText. Give the AutoText entry a name, and then click OK. The next time you want to use the text, simply type the name you gave it, and Word will automatically replace it with the full text.

2. Format Painter: The Format Painter allows you to quickly copy the formatting of text and apply it to another part of your document. To use this macro command, select the text you want to copy the format from, click on the Format Painter button in the Home tab, and then click on the text you want to apply the formatting to.

3. Increase or Decrease Font Size: This macro command allows you to change the font size of selected text quickly. To increase the font, select the text and press Alt + Shift + >. To decrease the font size, select the text and press Alt + Shift + <.

4. Highlight and Copy Text: With this macro command, you can quickly highlight and copy text with one click. To use this macro, select the text you want to copy, hold down the Ctrl key, and click on the text. The text will now be copied to the clipboard.

5. Remove all Hyperlinks: If you have a document with many hyperlinks, you can remove them all at once with this macro command. To use this macro, press Ctrl + A to select all text, click on the Macros button in the Developer tab, and choose the “RemoveHyperlinks” macro.
