In this article, I hope to compile a huge list of all the different methods and tricks that I’ve used to get the last bit of juice out of a slow PC. Whether you are using an old PC or the latest and greatest in hardware, you can still use some of these tips to make your PC run faster.
 

 
Note that since I write two blogs, Help Desk Geek and Online Tech Tips, I have previously written about many performance tips already which I will link back to throughout. If I have not written about it, I’ve throw in a link to a relevant article from some of my other favorite sites. This list is in no particular order, just written in the order that I could think of them.
 
There are probably a lot of great tweaks and performance hacks that I’ve missed here, so feel free to chime in with comments! Enjoy!

61. Changing from Master/Slave to Cable Select on your hard drive configuration can significantly decrease your boot time.
 
62. Perform a virus scan on your computer regularly. Here’s a list of the most popular anti-virus software and some tips on how to protect yourself from viruses and malware.
 
63. Remove extra toolbars from your Windows taskbar and from your Internet browser.
 
64. Disable the Windows Vista and 7 Sidebar if you’re not really using it for anything important. All those gadgets take up memory and processing power.
 
65. If you have a SATA drive and you’re running Windows Vista or Windows 7, you can speed up your PC by enabling the advanced write caching features.
 
66. Learn how to use keyboard shortcuts for Windows 8, Windows 10, Microsoft Excel, Outlook, or create your own keyboard shortcuts.
 
67. Turn off the Aero visual effects in Windows Vista and 7 to increase computer performance.
 
68. If you are technically savvy and don’t mind taking a few risks, you can try to overclock your processor.
 
69. Speed up the Send To menu in Explorer by typing “sendto” in the Run dialog box and deleting unnecessary items.
 
70. Make sure to download all the latest Windows Updates, Service Packs, and hotfixes as they “normally” help your computer work better. You can update Windows without using Windows Update too.
 
71. Make sure that there are no bad sectors or other errors on your hard drive by using the ScanDisk or chkdsk utility.
 
72. If you are not using some of the hardware on your computer, i.e. floppy drive, CD-ROM drive, USB ports, IR ports, firewire port, etc., then go into your BIOS and disable them so that they do not use any power and do not have to be loaded during boot up.
 
73. Though it may seem silly, you can actually install faster software on your system. For example, Google Chrome is much faster than Firefox and IE IMHO. If you are using Adobe Photoshop, you can possibly accomplish the same tasks using Paint.NET. Use LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office. You get the idea, right?
 
74. If you have a dual boot setup, you can shorten the length of the boot menu timeout so that your preferred OS loads faster.
 
75. Though it’s less secure, you can always setup automatic login in Windows so that you boot right to the desktop after a restart.
 
76. I already mentioned reducing visual effects, but the same dialog has an option for processor scheduling also. You can choose from Programs or Background Services.
 
77. If you have lots of files in a single folder, it can slow down Explorer. It’s best to create multiple folders and spread out the files between the folders.
 
78. If you have files that are generally large on a specific partition, you might want to consider increasing the cluster size on NTFS to 16K or even 32K instead of 4K. This will help speed up opening of files. Only for advanced users.
 
79. OneDrive comes bundled with Windows 10 and eats up resources even if you’re not using it. Disable or uninstall OneDrive if you don’t need the cloud syncing.
 
80. Turn off unnecessary features in Windows by going to Control Panel, choosing Uninstall a program, and then clicking on Turn Windows features on and off. You can turn off Remote Differential Compression, Tablet PC components, DFS replication service, Windows Fax & Scan, Windows Meeting Space, Media Features, IE 11 and lots more.
 
81. If you have enabled the Hibernation feature in Windows 10, then you should also make sure Fast Startup is enabled for quicker boot time.
 
82. Completely uninstall programs and applications using a program like Revo Uninstaller. It will get rid of remnants left behind by normal uninstalls.
 
83. If you know what you are doing, you can install several hard drives into your machine and set them up in RAID 0, RAID 5, or other RAID configurations. RAID 0 is the fastest.
 
84. If you are using USB 1.0 or USB 2.0 ports, upgrade them to USB 3.0 ports. Or just buy a new expansion card and install it into an empty slot.
 
85. Remove the drivers for all old devices that may be hidden in Device Manager that you no longer use.
 
86. A more extreme option is to choose a faster operating system. If you find Vista or 7 to be slow, go with Windows 10. Switching to Mac OS X or Linux is also an option.
 
87. If you don’t care about the live tiles in the Windows 10 start menu, then you should disable them to improve performance.
 
88. It can be complicated to upgrade a CPU, but that’s not the case for GPUs. Upgrading your GPU can increase the performance of your PC even if you have an older CPU.
 
89. Disconnect any unused USB devices from your computer. They will slow down the boot and login processes in Windows.
 
90. If you have a desktop background, make sure it’s a small and simple bitmap image rather than a fancy picture off the Internet. The best is to find a really small texture and to tile it.
 
91. Change the privacy settings in Windows 10 so that your PC isn’t always trying to connect to Microsoft’s servers.
 
92. I’ve already mentioned virus scanning, but it’s worth mentioning that Windows Defender is usually good enough and you should uninstall any third-party anti-virus product as it will slow down your system. I still recommend using an anti-malware program in addition to Windows Defender.
 
93. If you have a custom built computer or a PC that was previously used, make sure to check the BIOS for optimal settings such as enabled CPU caches, correctly set IDE/SATA data transfer modes, memory timings, updated drivers, etc. You can also enable Fast/Quick boot if you have that option.
 
94. If you’ve been using one local account for a long time, it might be worth the effort to create a new user account with a clean profile. You can then delete the older user account later.
 
95. Though sometimes useful, if you want better performance you can disable taskbar thumbnails and disable thumbnail previews in Explorer.
 
96. For advanced users, you can disable program compatibility assistant, which checks each program at run-time for compatibility issues.
 
97. If you don’t use the Cortana digital assistant in Windows 10, you can save quite a bit of resources by disabling it altogether.
 
98. If you are running a 32-bit version of Windows, you need to get to a 64-bit version ASAP, even if it means upgrading your hardware.
 
99. Buy a new computer!!! ;) Pretty easy eh?
 
Whew! If you got through that entire list, I’m very impressed! Not all tips will apply to everyone, but there literally wasn’t anything else out on the Internet that I could add to this. If I have missed a good performance tip, make sure to comment. Enjoy!
