Introduction

Macbook Pro users have been facing a common problem of no backlight screen. This issue has caused us much inconvenience and frustration, and many of us have been seeking a solution for this problem. However, a shocking fix for this issue has emerged, and it seems like the solution is not working as expected. In this article, we will explore this issue and discuss the apparent failure of Lvds cable replacement.

Background

The no backlight screen issue is a common problem for Macbook Pro users. The backlight is responsible for illuminating the screen, making it visible even in low light situations. If this component fails, the screen goes dark, making it difficult or impossible to use the device. This issue has plagued many users and has caused significant inconvenience and frustration for them.

Lvds cable replacement emerged as a potential solution for this issue. The Lvds cable is the component responsible for transmitting the video signal from the motherboard to the screen. By replacing this component, many users hoped to solve the backlight problem and regain full functionality of their devices.

The Shocking Fix

Despite its initial promise, Lvds cable replacement seems to be failing as a solution for the no backlight screen issue. Many users who have attempted this fix have reported that it did not solve the problem, and the screen remained dark. This is particularly surprising, considering that this method has been used successfully to solve similar issues in the past.

Some experts are speculating as to why this fix is not working as it has before. Some believe that the issue may be related to the MacBook Pro's design, which may be causing the cables to degrade at a faster rate. Others suggest that the issue may be related to software, which might cause the backlight to fail, despite all hardware components being in good condition.

What Now?

The failure of Lvds cable replacement as a solution to the no backlight screen issue leaves many Macbook Pro users in a difficult position. If this method does not work, then what can users do to solve this issue and regain full functionality of their devices? Some solutions that have been suggested include resetting the SMC (System Management Controller), which controls the device's power functions. Others have suggested replacing the backlight itself, which requires more technical expertise but may be a more effective solution.

Conclusion

The no backlight screen issue has been a significant problem for many Macbook Pro users. While Lvds cable replacement initially seemed like a promising solution, it appears that it is failing to solve the issue for many users. This is a concerning development that highlights the need for alternative solutions to this prevalent issue. For the time being, resetting the SMC or replacing the backlight may be the most promising solutions for users facing this problem.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an old Macbook Pro that I use occasionally. I recently decided to tighten the hinge screws (I had done it successfully several times in the past) but this time my screen’s backlight was gone.
I suspect this was because I accidentally plugged the battery back in and also touched the logic board with the LDVS cable, which gave off a little spark. When I looked at the LDVS cable, the black tip was clearly a bit burnt:

So I went and bought a new LDVS cable (A1278), but this hasn’t fixed the backlight issue. The Macbook works perfectly well with an external display however. I also did a flashlight test but I did not see anything on my desktop, so I don’t think I damaged the backlight fuse.
Any suggestions? Here are some photos of the logic board:

 Sadly I’m suspecting the logic board connector is damaged and/or the driver logic. Time to get your system to someone who has the deeper skills to fix your logic board or you could just replace it.
