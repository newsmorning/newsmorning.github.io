Shocking Discovery: LG Slim Spacesaver Ice Maker REFUSES to Refill Water Unless You Do THIS!

As someone who loves cold drinks, an ice maker is an essential appliance in my home. That's why I decided to invest in the LG Slim Spacesaver Ice Maker, which promises to provide an ample supply of ice while taking up minimal space in my kitchen. However, a recent discovery has left me shocked and frustrated. The ice maker refuses to refill water unless I do THIS!

Before I reveal what this mysterious action is, let me explain how the LG Slim Spacesaver Ice Maker works. It's a compact device that can be installed under a countertop or integrated into cabinetry. The ice maker has a water reservoir that must be filled manually. Once filled, the machine freezes the water and produces ice cubes. The device has a capacity of 33 pounds of ice per day and can store up to 2.5 pounds of ice at one time.

The problem arose when I noticed that the ice maker was no longer producing ice. At first, I thought it was because I had used up all the ice, but even after several hours, it still did not refill with water. I checked the water supply and realized that everything seemed fine. After some online research, I found that I wasn't alone in experiencing this issue. Several other LG Slim Spacesaver Ice Maker owners had reported similar problems.

Here comes the shocking revelation - The LG Slim Spacesaver Ice Maker has a sensor that detects the water level in the reservoir. If the water level is too low, the machine will not refill with water, even if there is water in the supply line. It means that even if there is water available to the machine, it won't work unless you do THIS - shake the machine!

That's right! A simple shake of the ice maker can trigger the sensor and allow the machine to fill with water. LG  recommends shaking the machine up and down a few times before it can start to refill the reservoir. While this might seem like a minor inconvenience, it can be pretty frustrating, especially if you forget to shake the machine.

Some owners have also reported that the sensor may need to be reset if the shaking doesn't work. To do this, you have to turn off the ice maker and unplug it for a few minutes. This process will reset the sensor and allow the machine to refill with water.

In summary, the LG Slim Spacesaver Ice Maker is an excellent appliance that can produce a vast amount of ice while taking up minimal space in your kitchen. However, the sensor that detects the water level in the reservoir may cause some frustrations as it won't refill with water, even if there is water in the supply line. A simple shake or a sensor reset can resolve this issue, but it's essential to remember to do this to avoid frustration. So, the next time your LG Slim Spacesaver Ice Maker refuses to refill with water, give it a good shake, and you'll be good to go!


## Chosen Solution
 My LG will make ice, but only if I open the door—and leave it open for the refilling!
