Title: You Won't Believe How Much Smoother Your Gameplay Will Be After Doing This ONE Thing To Your Playstation 3 Super Slim

Introduction:

Are you tired of experiencing lags and freezes every time you play your favorite game on your Playstation 3 Super Slim? Do you often feel like throwing your controller across the room due to frustration? Well, you don't have to suffer anymore. There is a simple solution to your gaming woes which will make your gameplay buttery smooth. Intrigued? Read on and find out!

Step-by-Step Guide:

Step 1: Clean the Dust

The first step in optimizing the performance of your Playstation 3 Super Slim is to clean the dust. Over time, dust accumulates in the console, especially in the vents and fans, which reduces the airflow and causes overheating. This, in turn, leads to slower and choppy gameplay.

To clean the inside of your Playstation 3 Super Slim, you will need a soft cloth or brush, a can of compressed air, and a vacuum cleaner. Start by unplugging the console and removing any discs from it. Then, use the vacuum cleaner to remove the loose dust from the vents and fans. After that, use the soft brush or cloth to gently clean the interior of the console to remove the stubborn dust. Finally, use the can of compressed air to blow away any residue dust from the console.

Step 2: Upgrade the Hard Disk Drive

The second step in boosting your Playstation 3 Super Slim's performance is to upgrade the hard disk drive (HDD). The HDD is where your games and other data are stored, and the default one is often slow and not sufficient for modern games.

To upgrade the HDD, you will need a new 2.5-inch SATA internal HDD, a screwdriver, and a USB flash drive. Before you start, make sure to back up your data to the USB flash drive, as the upgrade will erase all data from the old HDD. Then, remove the old HDD by unscrewing it and replacing it with the new one. Finally, install the latest version of the PlayStation 3 system software by following the instructions provided by Sony on their website.

Step 3: Use a Cooling Fan

The final step in enhancing your Playstation 3 Super Slim's gameplay experience is to use a cooling fan. A cooling fan helps to improve the air circulation within the console, reducing the risk of overheating and performance issues.

To use a cooling fan, you will need to purchase one that is compatible with your Playstation 3 Super Slim. Then, follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer to install it correctly. After that, turn on your console and enjoy your smoother gaming experience.

Conclusion:

By following these three steps, you can significantly improve the performance of your Playstation 3 Super Slim and enjoy a smoother gameplay experience. Cleaning the dust, upgrading the hard disk drive, and using a cooling fan are all easy and affordable solutions to optimize your console's performance. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try and see the difference for yourself!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, i have my ps3 super slim for 4 years and a half, and i was wondering if i should change the thermal paste, the console works perfect maybe makes a different loud noise when i play the campaigns of CoD games but maybe is just myself.
But, in the case i should change the paste, which one i should buy? i readed it must be non conductive, which one are those? Maybe Arctic Silver 5 but i readed in their site that is slightly conductive http://www.arcticsilver.com/as5.htm or Arctic mx-4? which thermal paste is the best for a ps3 super slim?
Thanks in advance.

 if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.
Not overheating?  Leave it alone!
