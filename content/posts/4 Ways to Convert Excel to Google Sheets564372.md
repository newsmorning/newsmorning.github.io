If you are one of the many people who have been using Microsoft Excel for your spreadsheet needs, you may be curious about what Google Sheets has to offer. Google Sheets is a web-based spreadsheet program that is part of the Google Drive suite. It has many of the same features as Excel, but with some added benefits such as collaboration tools, automatic saving, and the ability to work on multiple devices.

One of the biggest concerns for Excel users who want to switch to Google Sheets is how to convert their existing Excel files to Google Sheets. Fortunately, the conversion process is very easy and can be done in just a few simple steps. In this article, we will share with you four tricks on how to seamlessly convert Excel to Google Sheets.

Once you have selected your options, click on "Import data." The Excel file will be converted into a Google Sheet, complete with all the formatting and formulas that were in the original file. It's important to note that certain features, such as macros or VBA code, may not be supported by Google Sheets.

Trick #2: Dragging and Dropping Excel Files into Google Drive

If you are an avid user of Google Drive, you can take advantage of its drag-and-drop features. Simply drag the Excel file from your computer's file explorer and drop it into your Google Drive account. Once the file is uploaded, it will automatically be converted into a Google Sheet.

Trick #3: Uploading Excel Files to Google Sheets

Another way to convert Excel files to Google Sheets is by uploading them from your computer. Similar to Trick #2, all you have to do is select the file you want to upload and drag it to the Google Sheets tab.

Alternatively, you can click on the "New" button in your Google Drive and select "Google Sheets." From there, you can choose to upload the Excel file and let Google Sheets do the rest.

Trick #4: Exporting Excel Files as Google Sheets

The final trick is to export your Excel file directly as a Google Sheet. This can be done by selecting "File," then "Download," then "Google Sheets." The file will be converted and downloaded as a Google Sheet.

This trick is useful if you have already made changes to an Excel file and want to save it as a Google Sheet for further collaboration and sharing.

If you’ve been working with data in Excel and you’ve realized you want to use Google Sheets functions or scripting, it’s fairly easy to convert files from Excel to Google Sheets.
 
However, there are multiple ways you can do this depending on the format of the original data. The process depends on whether the Excel spreadsheet is saved in CSV format, standard Excel format, or includes any scripting already.
 
In this article we’ll look at four ways you can convert Excel files to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
 

 
## 1. Simplest: Convert Excel to Google Sheets with Copy and Paste
 
If you only need to convert data from Excel to Google Sheets and you don’t have any complicated functions or scripts in the background, a simple copy and paste of the data will do.
 
1. To do this, just highlight all of the cells you want to copy in Excel. Right click anywhere in the selected range and select Copy.
 
2. Right-click in the upper left cell in the Google Sheets spreadsheet where you’d like to place the data. Select Paste.
 
This will fill in the sheet with all of the data you’ve copied from the Excel spreadsheet. It’s as simple as that.
 
## 2. From Excel File: Just Open the Excel File Directly
 
You can open an Excel file (*.XLSX) directly, but you’ll need to go through a step to upload the file first. 
 
In Google Sheets, just follow these steps to open an Excel file directly.
 
- Select File from the menu, and select Open or Import.

 
- In the window that appears, select the Upload tab and then select the Select a file from your device button.

 
- Browse to the Excel file that’s stored on your computer, select it, and select the Open button.

 
- This will upload the Excel file and then open it in Google Sheets.

 
You will notice several things happen when you use this approach to convert Excel to Google Sheets.
 
- The Excel file automatically converts to Google Sheets format.It opens in a newly created spreadsheet in your Google Sheets account.The formatting matches that of the original Excel spreadsheet as much as possible.

 
## 3. Importing CSV: Import Directly From an CSV File
 
You can import directly from an Excel file that’s saved in CSV format. However, you’ll need to know how the file is delimited; whether it’s tab or comma delimited, or with some other character.
 
#### Using the Import Feature
 
Follow the same procedure above, but when you select the CSV file, you’ll see a window to select what the formatting of the file is, and how you want to convert the spreadsheet data into a Google Sheet spreadsheet.
 
You can also configure whether you want to open the data in a new spreadsheet, to replace the current sheet, or append to the current sheet. Also configure whether you want the text from the CSV file converted to the appropriate data type (numbers, dates, and formulas).
 
Once you’ve made your conversion options, select Import data to bring the CSV file data into your Google Sheets spreadsheet.
 
#### Using the IMPORTDATA Function
 
Another approach to bringing in data from an Excel file saved in CSV format is by using the IMPORTDATA function in Google Sheets.
 
There is one catch to this approach. The file needs to be stored on a web server online, and accessible via a direct link. For example, the Census Bureau provides lots of data files in CSV format, such as population totals by state at the following link: 
 
https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/national/totals/nst-est2019-alldata.csv
 
You can import the data directly from such a CSV file into your Google Sheets spreadsheet using the IMPORTDATA function.
 
1. Open a new Google Sheets spreadsheet. Click on the cell where you want the imported data to go. In that cell, type:  =IMPORTDATA(“https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/national/totals/nst-est2019-alldata.csv”)
 
2. When you press Enter, you’ll see a loading status for a few seconds. Then all of the data will show up in the spreadsheet.
 
3. If you want to take a snapshot of the data and put it into a new spreadsheet so that it doesn’t update any time the source CSV data changes online, just highlight all of the cells of the original sheet and copy them. Then open a new sheet, right-click in the cell where you want the data to go and select Paste special, then Paste values only.
 
This will copy all of the original data into a new, static spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
 
## 4. Open With: Open File After Uploading
 
There is one more technique to convert Excel to Google Sheets. This works whether the file is saved in CSV or XLSX format. 
 
1. Upload the file directly to your Google Drive account inside any folder.
 
2. Right-click the file and choose Open with, then choose Google Sheets.
 
3. If this is a CSV file, it’ll open directly in Google Sheets format. If it’s in XLSX format it will open in Google Docs in XLSX format. You’ll see this displayed at the top. To convert it to Google Sheets format, select File from the menu and then select Save as Google Sheets. 
 
This will convert the spreadsheet and open it into a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
 
## Converting Excel to Google Sheets
 
As you can see there’s more than just one way to get Excel spreadsheet data into Google Sheets. The approach you choose depends on the format of the original file, and which procedure feels the most convenient to you.
