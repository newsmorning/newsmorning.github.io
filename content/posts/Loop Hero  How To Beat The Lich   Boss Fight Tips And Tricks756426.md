# Unlock the Secret to Defeating the Treacherous Lich in Loop Hero - Here are the Ultimate Boss Fight Tips and Tricks!

Loop Hero is one of the most popular indie games around these days. With its unique and innovative gameplay, players can't help but become addicted to the game. But as fun and seductive as it is, there are still many challenges to overcome in Loop Hero's ever-evolving world. Once you've got a feel for the gameplay, you will need to battle your way through various villains, including the dreaded Lich. In this article, we provide you with the ultimate boss fight tips and tricks to take down the treacherous Lich.

## Set Yourself up for Success

Before you take on the Lich, you will need to ensure that your hero is well-prepared. Here are some tips on how to level up and get the necessary equipment:

- First, build a campfire. It will help you regenerate health and provide bonuses for your hero.
- Next, place cards that will improve your hero's stats. For example, the Field of Blades that will increase your attack speed.
- Don't forget to place cards that give resources. You need to avoid wasting resources to survive to reach the boss fight.

## Understand the Lich's Behaviors

Knowing the Lich's behavior is crucial to defeating it. There are three stages of the Lich fight:

1. Summon Skeletal Army: Unlike other bosses, Lich will start by summoning his minions. He will keep summoning them until he reaches the endgame phase, so don't be tempted to waste time taking them down.
2. Curse: Lich will deal curse damage, reducing your hero's health regeneration and defense. You will need specific items, like the Orb of Evolution, to nullify the curse effects.
3. Summon Illusion: In the final phase, Lich will summon an illusion, making it difficult to target him.

## Special Equipment and Skills

To successfully take down the Lich, you will need specific skills and equipment. Here are some of the most important ones:

- The River: A gear that increases your attack speed.
- The Frozen Pass: One of the best weapons that enable you to slow down enemies and enemy attacks.
- Ankh: Will revive your hero if they die, giving you another chance at defeating the Lich.

## Card Management

Card management is critical in defeating the Lich. Here are some tips:

1. Focus on resource cards to stay alive during the early stages.
2. Place cards that increase hero stats, like Field of Blades.
3. Place Oblivion cards strategically to keep the Lich from overwhelming you with skeletons.
4. Place Beacon cards to increase your chance of getting the necessary equipment.

## Final Thoughts

Defeating the Lich in Loop Hero is no easy feat, but it's not impossible. With the right equipment, skills, and strategy, you can take down the treacherous Lich and save your world from an eternal curse. Remember, Loop Hero is a strategy game that requires you to think outside the box. So, stay alert, manage your cards, and we hope these tips and tricks will help you take down the Lich and emerge victorious. Good luck!

The Lich in Loop Hero has unleashed chaos upon the world by bringing a timeless loop into the picture. And with the help of mystical cards, you have to progress in this roguelike RPG game packed with monsters, new terrains and show your bravery. It’s quite a challenging game in itself but when you face off with the boss, The Lich, you will need some extra tips and tricks to succeed. Don’t worry, here’s a guide on how to defeat The Lich in Loop Hero.
 
## Loop Hero: How to Defeat The Lich (Tips and Tricks)
 
Before taking on the first boss in Loop Hero, you have to know that he will be harder to handle than the other enemies you have encountered till now. You can spawn or summon this boss when the boss meter gets filled up. This meter will be present in the top left part of the game so keep an eye on that. How does the boss meter fill up, you ask? Well, you have to place cards to do that and that means you have to get more kills in. So go ahead and kill more smaller enemies and mobs to make it happen but don’t lose a lot of your health while you are at it. When you do enough of it, the first boss (The Lich) will spawn on the camp tile.
 

 
The Lich will make Palaces in the camp tile. You can reduce this number by putting buildings and filling up the squares. This is important to do because the each Palace tile will increase the boss’s health as well as damage by 5% (Researcher ability). You can also use the Oblivion card to get rid of the Lich Palace tiles so make sure you have it with you. So, your first goal is to ensure that the Lich Palaces don’t grow in number.
 
Another thing you need to keep in mind is that Lich is a Mage and does magic damage. This means you have to be prepared for magic attacks and have appropriate Magic Damage ready. You can also carry weapons that can help you against the undead like The Lich.
 
Which Cards to use specifically for The Lich boss battle? In terms of your deck of Cards, you need to have Grove, Meadow, Oblivion, Village, Blood Grove and Battlefield in it.
 
Here are all defenses you need to battle and beat The Lich in Loop Hero:
 
- The Herbalist’s Hut (Potions)
 - Evasion stat
 - Vampirism stat

 
These are the must-haves in your boss fight with The Lich in Loop Hero. The Herbalist’s Hut will give you potions that will help your health during the tough battle. So go ahead and build it as soon as possible. Evasion and Vampirism will give you the ability to dodge and heal respectively. Since the fight will happen automatically, you have to plan and strategize in a way that the tides turn in your favor. Do a mix of everything mentioned above to beat The Lich in Loop Hero.
