# Unlock the Secret to Saving Thousands on Your Retina Macbook: A1534 Logic Board Compatibility Revealed Between 2015 and 2016 Models!

Are you a proud owner of a Retina Macbook but bummed about its skyrocketing repair costs? Well, we have good news for you! A recent discovery reveals that the logic boards of Retina Macbook models of 2015 and 2016 are cross-compatible, potentially saving you thousands of dollars on expensive repairs or replacements.

The logic board, also known as the motherboard, is an essential component of your Retina Macbook that houses all of its critical components, including the processor, memory, and storage. If your logic board is damaged, repairing or replacing it can cost a fortune - a whopping $700 to $1000 on average, which could even exceed the cost of buying a brand new Macbook in some cases.

The discovery of logic board compatibility between the 2015 and 2016 models of Retina Macbook, specifically A1534 models, is excellent news for Macbook owners. It opens up the possibility of using a logic board from a cheaper, older A1534 model in a newer one, reducing the cost of repairs.

How To Check The Compatibility?

To figure out whether it's possible to use the logic board from an older A1534 Macbook model in a newer one, you need to check whether they have the same EMC numbers.

EMC, short for Electromagnetic Compatibility, is a number used to identify Retina Macbook models based on their hardware specifications. To check your Macbook's EMC number, go to the Apple menu, click on the 'About This Mac' option, and then click on the 'System Report' button. Look for the EMC number under the 'Hardware Overview' section, and compare it with the EMC number of the other A1534 model you want to check compatibility with.

If the EMC numbers match, then it's highly likely that the logic board from the older Retina Macbook will work with the newer model, saving you a significant amount of money on repairs or replacements.

Why Some Macbooks Cost More to Repair Than Others?

The cost of repairing a Retina Macbook depends on several factors, most notably the age and model of the device. Generally, older Macbook models cost less to repair than newer ones because of their availability of spare parts, complexity of the hardware, and the skill level required to fix them.

The Retina Macbook, in particular, is one of the most challenging devices to repair, given its thin and compact design. Experts with advanced technical skills and specialized equipment are required to fix these devices, driving up the costs.

Besides, some components of Retina Macbooks, such as the logic board, are proprietary, making them expensive to replace. Fortunately, the discovery of compatibility between the A1534 models of Retina Macbook can help ease this cost burden.

Conclusion

In conclusion, repairing or replacing a damaged Retina Macbook's logic board can be a wallet-denting experience. But, thanks to the recent discovery of compatibility between the 2015 and 2016 models' A1534 logic boards, Macbook owners can save thousands of dollars on repair or replacement costs.

Before attempting to use an older Retina Macbook's logic board in a newer model, be sure to check the EMC number to ensure compatibility. Doing so can help you save a significant amount of money while extending the life of your precious Macbook.
