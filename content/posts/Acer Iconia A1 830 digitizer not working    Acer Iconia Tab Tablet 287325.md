You may already have tried to go through the device's settings or update the firmware, but nothing seems to work. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the issue, discuss what the digitizer is, and offer some tips on what you can do to fix it.

What is the Digitizer?

The digitizer is an essential component of your Acer Iconia Tab. It is a thin layer of glass that sits on top of the tablet's LCD screen. This layer is responsible for converting your touch or stylus input into digital signals that the device can understand. This technology makes your device responsive to your touch, and you can use it to interact with the screen, launch apps, scroll through menus, and more.

Why is the Digitizer Not Working?

The digitizer may stop working due to several reasons, but the most common ones include:

Hardware Problems: Sometimes, the digitizer may stop working due to hardware issues like a damaged screen or a malfunctioning digitizer.

Software Issues: It could also be due to software-related issues, including outdated firmware, corrupted operating system, or incompatible apps.

What Can You Do To Fix It?

If your Acer Iconia tab tablet's digitizer is not working, here are a few steps you can take to fix it:

Restart Your Device: Sometimes, restarting your tablet can help, especially if the digitizer stops working due to a software glitch.

Calibrate the Screen: Your Acer Iconia tab comes with a calibration tool that you can use to calibrate the screen to ensure it can detect your touch.

Update the Firmware: Updating the firmware will ensure that your device has the latest version of its operating software. Sometimes, outdated software can cause the digitizer to stop working, so ensure that your tablet is up to date.

Factory Reset: If all else fails, you can do a factory reset, which will restore your device to its original state. Make sure you backup all your important files before doing this.

Conclusion

Your Acer Iconia tablet is a valuable tool that you can use for work, entertainment, and many other activities. The digitizer is a crucial component of the tablet, and if it's not working, your device can seem useless. But, as weâ€™ve seen, there are ways to fix this issue. By trying the above steps, you can ensure that your device works correctly, and you can continue to use it to its full potential.

 Same problem here! Help! I purchased mine just a month ago and I don't know if the warranty covers my current tablet problem! I just had a technician checked it and they said it needs replacement and it costs P2800 (Philippine Peso). Thanks for the help!

 you will need to take the back of using a plastic opening tool to get it open. then you need to take the battery out and put it back in and turn the device back on and it should work because it reboots it
