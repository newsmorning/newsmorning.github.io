Introduction

If you're a retro game enthusiast like me, you probably own a Sega CD Model 2. It's a classic piece of gaming hardware that can still provide hours of entertainment. However, like any electronic device, it can run into issues from time to time. The most frustrating one is when the CD drive stops spinning. Don't panic, though! In this article, I'll share my experience and the jaw-dropping fix for this problem.

The symptoms

One day, I fired up my Sega CD Model 2, and it made a clicking noise before a "Disc Error" message appeared on the screen. I ejected the game and tried another one, but it failed to load as well. After a few attempts, I noticed that the CD drive wasn't spinning. I tried resetting the console, cleaning the laser lens, and checking the power supply, but nothing worked. This was a serious issue that needed fixing.

The diagnosis

After some research, I found that this was a common problem with the Sega CD Model 2. The spindle motor that spins the CD can fail due to wear and tear or a power surge. The motor has a small gearbox with two plastic gears that can break, causing the motor to stop spinning. This was clearly the root of the problem in my case, as I could hear the motor trying to spin initially but then making a clicking noise.

The fix

I considered sending my console to a repair service to fix the issue. However, the cost was high, and the repair would take a while to complete. Fortunately, I stumbled upon a jaw-dropping fix that saved me money and time. It may sound absurd, but it worked! The fix involves lubricating the gears and spinning the motor by hand several times, causing the gears to reposition themselves and engage properly.

Here's how to do it:

1. Open your Sega CD Model 2 by removing the screws on the bottom of the console.

2. Locate the spindle motor and its small gearbox. It's connected to the CD lid by a white plastic arm.

3. Carefully remove the gear cover on the gearbox. You can use a small flat-head screwdriver to pry it off.

4. Apply a drop of light machine oil or silicone lubricant to each of the two plastic gears.

5. Manually spin the motor by turning the white plastic arm with your finger or a small tool. Do this several times until you feel smooth resistance.

6. Reattach the gear cover and close the console.

7. Test your Sega CD Model 2 by inserting a game disc and turning it on.

Conclusion

Fixing a Sega CD Model 2 with a CD drive that won't spin can be daunting, but it's not impossible. The jaw-dropping fix I shared may seem odd, but it worked perfectly for me, and I've been enjoying my retro games again. If you're experiencing the same issue, give it a try before seeking professional repair services. Remember to be careful when opening your console and lubricating the gears, and use appropriate tools and lubricants. Happy gaming!

## Chosen Solution
 ive found that my sega cd is not reading disks ive had the unit apart and found that the laser will attempt to find the disk but the motor wont spin the caps on the board appear to be fine as do the other components i have attempted to clean the lens to no avail and suggestions as the what the problem could be?

 Carter Logan make sure that the nylon gears on the the sled drive are in good working order and do not have any broken teeth etc. Make sure they mesh. You also want to check for power on the motor. After that I suggest you check the schematics and measure the caps etc. After all, things are getting a bit weak after 30 years :-) and recapping might just be on order.
