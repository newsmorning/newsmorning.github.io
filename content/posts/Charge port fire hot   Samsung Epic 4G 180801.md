+++ Is Your Samsung Epic 4G a FIRE HAZARD? Shocking Charge Port Discovery Exposed! +++

Samsung Epic 4G is a popular device that many people still use today. However, a recent discovery has revealed that it may pose a fire hazard. The issue has to do with the charging port, which is prone to overheating and dangerously melting. If you own a Samsung Epic 4G, you must read this article immediately to protect yourself and your family.

The issue was first reported by a Reddit user who posted a picture of their melted Samsung Epic 4G charging port. The user claimed that they had used the original charger and cable, but the device still overheated and melted. Since then, many other users have come forward with similar stories, indicating that this is a widespread issue.

According to experts, the issue may be caused by a design flaw in the device's charging port. The port is made from a cheap plastic material that cannot withstand the heat generated during charging. As a result, the port can overheat and melt, posing a significant fire hazard.

However, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself from this fire hazard. First, if you own a Samsung Epic 4G, you should stop using it immediately and avoid charging it until you can replace the charging port. You can find replacement charging ports online or at your local electronics store.

Secondly, you should never leave your Samsung Epic 4G unattended while it is charging. If the device overheats and melts, it can start a fire that can quickly spread and cause substantial damage to your property and put your life at risk. Always keep a close eye on your phone while it is charging and disconnect it immediately if you notice any signs of overheating or melting.

Lastly, you should avoid using third-party charging cables or chargers that are not recommended by Samsung. These cheap alternatives may not be rated for the same level of power as the original charger, causing the phone to overheat and melt.

In conclusion, Samsung Epic 4G may pose a fire hazard due to a design flaw in its charging port. If you own this device, you must take immediate action to protect yourself and your family. Stop using the device until you can replace the charging port and avoid leaving it unattended while charging. Additionally, only use original Samsung chargers and cables to avoid further risks. Stay safe!

## Chosen Solution
 Phone will not turn on. Battery is fine. I have it down to board level.  Plugged in to charger and within seconds charge port itself is fire hot and smells like burnt plastic.
Thank you

 check for shorting on plug? is it an OEM plug? pin alignment proper? an OEM charger? what were the symptoms before it went dark? check for heat damage from the possible shorting at the plug and the board, if it has gotten that hot it may have re-soldered its own connections
together- check for any abnormal solder flow anywhere near the heat source.
is the pwr button stuck in the depressed pos?
these are just off the top of the ole noggen, good luck. and remember to use your heat-sinks.
