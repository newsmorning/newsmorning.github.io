Title: You Won't Believe How I Saved My Water Damaged Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 From Certain Doom!

Introduction:

Water damage is one of the most common causes of electronic device failures, and my Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 was no exception. One day, while sipping coffee, I accidentally spilled it all over my laptop. I had heard horror stories of how expensive it was to get it fixed from Apple or any authorized repair center. But I was determined to fix it myself, and after some research, I found an unusual yet effective hack that saved my Macbook from certain doom. In this article, I will share my experience and how I fixed my water-damaged Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012.

Body:

Step 1: Turn off the Macbook

The first thing I did was to shut down my Macbook completely by pressing and holding the power button. I disconnected all peripheral devices connected to it and removed the battery and the charging cable.

Step 2: Disassemble the Macbook

I unscrewed the back cover of my Macbook and removed it to expose the inner components. I also disconnected the battery and the SSD drive from the motherboard.

Step 3: Clean the Macbook with Isopropyl Alcohol

I took a microfiber cloth and soaked it in isopropyl alcohol, making sure that it was not dripping. Then, I dabbed the cloth on the Macbook's internal components to remove any moisture and coffee residues. I also used a toothbrush to clean the small components.

Step 4: Dry the Macbook

I let the Macbook dry in a ventilated room for 24 hours before reassembling it. It is essential to ensure that all parts are completely dry before putting them back. I also used a hairdryer to make sure there was no remaining moisture.

Step 5: Reassemble the Macbook

I carefully put back all the components in their respective slot, like the SSD and battery, making sure that all screws are tightly fitted. I also cleaned the exterior of the Macbook using a damp cloth and then let it dry before switching it on.

Step 6: Switch it on and hope for the best

After reassembling the Macbook, I switched it on, and to my surprise, it worked correctly. All my files and data were intact, and my laptop was fully functional.

Conclusion:

Water damage to electronic devices can be disastrous and costly to repair. However, with some quick thinking, research, and a bit of elbow grease, I was able to save my water-damaged Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 from certain doom. All I needed was a microfiber cloth, isopropyl alcohol, and a hairdryer. By taking the right action, I was able to avoid the hefty repair bills and continue to enjoy my laptop to this day.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey, I hope this is the correct place to post this.
I have a Mid 2012 MBP which I spilt some water over yesterday. It was working fine until I switched it off completely and left it to dry overnight.
Woke up this morning to see that it was completely dead. Not turning on, no charger light nothing.
So I opened it up and swapped the battery (I bought a new one recently and I put the old one in) but still no response whatsoever.
However it was stuck in some kind of cycle where it would boot up, make the Apple ‘sound’ and suddenly switch off... I’ve linked a video to this.

Do you guys have any suggestions on what I can do or is it a lost cause?
I’ve left alone with the battery out for the time being.
Thanks

 Take it to a reputable repair shop that does macbook repairs if you want to get this fixed. There is liquid damage / corrosion on the board.  Some components such as capacitors, resistors, diodes, QFN chips and more may need to be replaced on the logic board.
