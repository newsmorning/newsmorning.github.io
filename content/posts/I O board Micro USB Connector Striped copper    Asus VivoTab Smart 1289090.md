Ever since the advent of technology, people have been looking for ways to enhance their user experience. While devices have been getting more and more advanced, a major issue persists – battery life. Specifically, with the advancement in processing power and graphics, battery life for most devices with full-blown operating systems like Windows 10 can be a major concern. The Asus Vivotab Smart is one such device. But what if I told you that you could revolutionize your Vivotab Smart experience with a game-changing micro-USB connector that utilizes striped copper technology to boost your device's performance and solve all your charging problems?

Enter the Striped Copper Technology Micro-USB connector, one of the best Micro-USB cables for the Asus Vivotab Smart. The stripe copper technology is a revolutionary advancement that was introduced to enhance the efficiency of cables. The technology employs the use of stripes on a copper wire, as opposed to covering the cable in a shield. The copper strips used in the wire provide ample shield from interference and add to the micro-USB cable's overall durability.

The Striped Copper Technology Micro-USB connector works wonders for the Asus Vivotab Smart to enhance device performance and charging times. The technology is excellent for charging because it provides a more substantial, stable power stream leading to increased energy transfer with less power loss. As a result, you will experience faster charging times and more freedom with your device.

Moreover, the Striped Copper Technology Micro-USB connector is designed in such a way that it minimizes data loss, distortion and parasitic capacitance, which are frequent problems with regular micro-USB cables. This means that data transfer speeds will be faster and more stable, leading to smoother and efficient operation.

But it doesn't stop there- the Striped Copper Technology Micro-USB connector also reduces the effects of electromagnetic interference, which can disrupt your device's audio and video output. With clear audio and less distortion, streaming online content and video calls become more apparent and noiseless.

In summary, it’s hard to overestimate the value of the Striped Copper Technology Micro-USB connector. This product has been innovatively designed to improve the user experience while using the Asus Vivotab Smart. The faster charging and stable data transfer combine to make this product an indispensable tool for anyone who uses their Asus Vivotab Smart regularly. No more waiting for hours to recharge your device, and no more lost data during transfer. Enhanced audio and video streaming that is free of noise make the Striped Copper Technology Micro-USB connector the perfect solution for anyone who needs a reliable micro-USB cable. It's about time that you revolutionize your experience with this game-changing micro-USB connector.

## Chosen Solution
 My sister gave me her tablet because it was"not charging and sounded like something was shaking around" after inspection the interior of the Micro USB port was disconnected and somehow striped the connector copper of the I/O board. I tried to find a replacement part but the official store no longer carries it because of the tablets age, and other places the part costs more than getting a new tablet.  Is it possible to somehow fix the board or will I need to buy a new one/device?

 if its like this they are available on ebay

 you would need to solder a jumper where the missing pad is. just replacing the charge port wont be enough unfortunately. it it stripped some of the lead away as well you can take an exato knife and strip the protection away a little to reveal more copper trace, just very carefully.
