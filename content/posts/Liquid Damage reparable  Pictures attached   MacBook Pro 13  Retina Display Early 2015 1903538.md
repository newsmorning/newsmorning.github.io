Step 1: Turn off the MacBook and unplug it immediately after the water damage occurs. Do not try to turn it back on.

If you are not comfortable attempting to repair your MacBook yourself, it is highly recommended to take it to a professional repair shop. They have the necessary tools and expertise to fix water damage and ensure your device is functioning properly.

## Chosen Solution
 hello guys,
my mbp r 2015 wouldnt start up. i detected a damaged backlight connector and pulled the logicboard out of the bottom case.
there seems to be a burnt area - is this reparable?

thanks in advance

 Pretty sure that can be fixed. I would just need to harvest the connector then solder it. Probably would have to make a jumper or 2. Would you feel comfortable with the repair yourself? You would need some microsoldering equipment and a microscope.

 do i have to replace the damaged connector? i wouldnt mind to use the mbpr keyboard without the backlight?
i will use alcohol to remove the corrosion - is there more that i can do?
