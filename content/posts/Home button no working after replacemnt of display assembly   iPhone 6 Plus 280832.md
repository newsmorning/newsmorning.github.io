Title: You won't believe what happened after replacing my iPhone 6 Plus display - Home button failure!

Introduction:

Apple's iPhone 6 Plus model was released on September 19th, 2014, and had a huge following due to its sleek design, larger screen, and improved camera features. The device had received significant advancements compared to its predecessor, and many users had still kept their iPhone 6 Plus over the years. However, with age comes wear and tears, and like any other device, iPhone 6 Plus users often face minor issues that require repairs. One of the most common repairs iPhone 6 Plus users need is replacing the display. However, some users have reported that replacing their iPhone 6 Plus display has led to home button failure as well.

The Story:

A few years ago, I had been struggling with my iPhone 6 Plus's screen for quite some time. It had several cracks and scratches that made it difficult to use my phone efficiently. Moreover, the screen had become more unresponsive than usual. Hence, I decided to replace the screen myself to restore its original functioning. I purchased a replacement screen from a reliable vendor and spent an hour replacing it.

After replacing the display screen, I turned on my iPhone 6 Plus, and it was working like a charm. The new screen was much brighter than the old one, and it seemed like my iPhone was functioning even better than before. However, my happiness was short-lived. The next day, I noticed that my home button had stopped working. I tried pressing it several times, but nothing worked.

Initially, I thought that the problem might have been due to a software issue. I tried resetting my iPhone and even restored it to factory settings, but the problem persisted. Even a hard reset wasn't able to fix the issue. That's when I realized that the problem might be due to the replacement of the screen.

After some research, I found out that the home button and the screen are both connected through their cables, meaning that replacing the display screen could directly affect the home button's functionality. Although the screen might have been working fine, the connection between the home button and the display screen might have become faulty after the replacement.

To fix the problem, I had to take my iPhone 6 Plus to an authorized Apple repair center. They had informed me that they would need to replace the entire display unit and the home button to ensure that the issue was resolved.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, replacing a display screen can be a simple task that can save you from purchasing a new device. However, it is essential to understand that replacing specific parts can lead to other problems, just like what I experienced. In hindsight, I should have taken my iPhone to a professional to avoid disrupting other components that could affect my phone's functionality. Therefore, the moral of my story is that you shouldn't try to repair your device unless you are confident with your skills, as it can lead to permanent damages that will be expensive to fix.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I received the parts today.
I replaced cracked display with the receiveed display assembly and the home button was not working.
To confirm the home button is working fine, I installed back the cracked display assembly to the iphone and the home button working fine.
Please advice how to handle the defect part received?

 If you have a defective part, you should contact the seller for an exchange or refund.
On the 6 plus, the screen does not have anything to do with the home button though, unless your screen also came with the back plate that has the flex connecting the home button to the motherboard.

 Hi,
If your home button is working with your old screen and not the new screen, then your problem is the home button extension flex that sits behind the shield, transfer the shield over from the original screen and this should solve your issues. :-)
