Samsung Galaxy S5 users stunned as latest update turns their phones into screens-less machines!

Samsung has always been a popular brand amongst smartphone users across the world. The Samsung Galaxy S5 was released back in 2014 and became an instant hit. However, the recent update has caused a major setback for the phone's users. The new update has completely removed the phone's display, leaving users perplexed and shocked.

The update, which was released a few days ago, was supposed to improve the phone's security system, improve the quality of the camera and fix some minor bugs. However, users soon realized that it had done anything but that. People who have updated their devices are now left with a phone that shows no display, and they are unable to use it.

This problem has created a wave of frustration and anger among Samsung Galaxy S5 users. Many have taken to social media platforms to express their dismay and share their experiences. Some users have even reported that the update has caused their devices to shut down completely, leaving them with no option but to dispose of it.

One user, Sarah from New York, shared her story on Twitter saying," I updated my Samsung Galaxy S5 and the next thing I knew, the screen disappeared. The phone still turns on, but I can't use it anymore." Another user, John from Los Angeles, shared a similar experience on Reddit, writing," I was so excited when I saw the software update notification on my phone, but now I'm devastated. I can't believe this has happened. I have been using the Samsung Galaxy S5 for years, and now it's just a useless piece of junk."

Samsung has yet to respond to this issue. They have not officially released any statements or issued any instructions to fix the problem. However, experts suggest that the only way to restore the phone back to its original state is by hard resetting it completely. This would mean that all the data stored on the device will be lost.

In conclusion, the latest Samsung Galaxy S5 update has caused a lot of inconvenience and trouble for its users. The phone's display disappearing after an update is a significant issue that needs to be addressed by the company as soon as possible. It's important for companies to ensure that any updates they release are thoroughly tested before being made available to consumers. Samsung needs to take responsibility for their actions and find a quick and satisfactory solution to this problem. Until then, the affected users are left with phones that are nothing but expensive paperweights.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced my housing on galaxy s5 now the screen will not light but it is touch responsive

 Take it apart, and put it back together. Maybe you didn't make a good connection,  or forgot something.
