Title: The Shocking Result of Plugging my USA Nutribullet into High Voltage

Introduction:

Nutribullet is one of the most popular and handy kitchen appliances that is widely used to create juices, smoothies, and protein shakes. It's compact design, and easy-to-use features make it a go-to appliance for health-conscious consumers. However, what happens when you plug a USA Nutribullet into high voltage?

Body:

Last week, while I was traveling in Europe, I decided to bring my Nutribullet along, thinking it would be a great way to stay healthy while on vacation. However, I made an amateur mistake and plugged my USA Nutribullet into the high-voltage power outlet instead of using a voltage converter.

Without any warning, as soon as I turned on the Nutribullet, I was met with an incredibly loud noise that came from the motor, followed by a sudden jostling that shook the machine so violently that it ended up flying out of my hand and onto the kitchen counter.

To my amazement, when I looked at the Nutribullet, I noticed that the blades had been twisted and deformed, as if they had been glued together. On close inspection, I realized that the high voltage had caused an intense electrical burst that had effectively overheated and melted the plastic casing and the iron blades.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the experience of plugging a USA Nutribullet into high voltage was scary and dangerous. It's important to understand the different voltage rates and compatibility of electrical appliances while traveling to different parts of the world. Always make sure to use the right voltage converter or purchase local appliances if necessary. Fortunately, no one was hurt in my case and, although my beloved Nutribullet is gone, I am still amazed by the incredible amount of energy produced by high voltage electricity.

## Chosen Solution
 I also accidentally plugged my newly bought nutribullet from the USA into a higher voltage socket in Ghana and instantly, power passed through making it not function. Can anyone help please? I’m in Ghana and so if anyone has recommendations for a repairer who can get it fixed, I’ll appreciate it greatly.

 Hi,
Try searching online for some reputable, professional appliance repair services in your location to get it fixed.
Hopefully there may be two or three to choose from. If so, check online for any reviews about their service etc and see what they show, then contact all of them and ask about their charges and if they offer a guarantee on their workmanship etc. Most reputable repairers give at least 30 days. If they don't then find someone else who does.
Armed with this information go with whoever you feel most comfortable dealing with.
Sorry to be so vague but as ifixit is a worldwide forum, you may not get an answer here at all. Also recommendations can be too subjective so are not usually permitted on ifixit as it may be construed as advertising.
Hopefully all that has happened to your blender is that a surge suppressor and a fuse may have blown on the control board and can be easily repaired by a professional.
If you feel like trying to repair it yourself, disassemble the blender and take some pictures of the control board and post them back here in your question. Hopefully it can be seen what has happened and some advice given as to what to do to fix it. Here's how to do this on ifixit Adding images to an existing question
