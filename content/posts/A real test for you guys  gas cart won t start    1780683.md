Are You Smart Enough to Fix a Gas Cart That Won't Start? Take Our Real Test Now!

If you're an owner of a gas cart, sooner or later, you'll go through the frustration of it not starting. It's a situation we've all experienced, and the solution to the problem can range from simple to complicated.

But have you ever wondered if you're smart enough to fix a gas cart that won't start? Are you confident in your knowledge and problem-solving abilities when it comes to your golf cart?

Well, you're about to find out! Take our real test to determine just how smart you are when it comes to fixing a gas cart that won't start.

Question 1: Do you know how to jump-start a gas cart?

If your gas cart won't start, the first thing you should try is jump-starting it. Do you know how to properly jump-start a gas cart? If not, don't worry; we'll provide you with some tips.

To jump-start a gas cart, you'll need a set of jumper cables and another vehicle with a fully charged battery. Connect the jumper cables from the fully charged battery to the dead battery of your gas cart, and start the engine of the second vehicle. This will transfer power to your gas cart and get it started.

Question 2: Do you know how to check the battery voltage?

The battery is a common culprit when it comes to a gas cart that won't start. But do you know how to check the battery voltage to determine if it's the cause of the problem?

To check the battery voltage, you'll need a voltmeter. Connect the voltmeter to the battery and read the voltage. A voltage reading of 12.6 volts or higher indicates that the battery is fully charged. A reading of 12.4 volts or lower means that the battery is partially charged or fully discharged and may need to be charged or replaced.

Question 3: Do you know how to check the spark plug?

The spark plug is another common culprit when it comes to a gas cart that won't start. But do you know how to check the spark plug to determine if it's the cause of the problem?

To check the spark plug, remove it from the engine and inspect the tip. If the tip is dirty or covered in oil, it may need to be cleaned or replaced. If it's clean and still not working, you'll need to test it with a spark tester to determine if it's producing a spark. If it's not producing a spark, then it needs to be replaced.

Question 4: Do you know how to check the fuel filter?

A clogged fuel filter can also prevent your gas cart from starting. But do you know how to check the fuel filter to determine if it's the cause of the problem?

To check the fuel filter, remove it from the engine and inspect it for dirt and debris. If it's dirty, you'll need to clean or replace it. If it looks clean, you can test the fuel flow rate using a fuel flow meter.

Question 5: Do you know how to check the carburetor?

A dirty or clogged carburetor can also prevent your gas cart from starting. But do you know how to check the carburetor to determine if it's the cause of the problem?

To check the carburetor, remove it from the engine and inspect it for dirt and debris. If it's dirty, you'll need to clean or rebuild it. If it looks clean, you can test it with a carburetor cleaner and a carburetor tester to determine if it's functioning properly.

Now that you've completed the test, you should have a better understanding of how smart you are when it comes to fixing a gas cart that won't start. If you missed some of the questions, don't worry! You can always study up and learn more about your gas cart to become a pro at fixing it.

## Chosen Solution
 Howdy, do I recently got a 2016 club cart precident. And I ran into problems because it wouldn’t start. The battery is good but when I press the gas nothing happened. So I replaced all suspect parts, solenoid, carb, micro switch, fuses, I even replaced the gas petal. I made a little progress because now there is a clicking when I press gas but other than that it won’t start. Any ideas?

 when u say u pressed the gas what do u mean, like did the rev get higher and nothing moved or when u press it, it stays at idle?

 We have this issue at work a-lot but the main issue that we found is that the gas pump does not have the suction to pull the gas from the tank so there should be a little clear fuel filter if there is no gasoline in that filter then that might be your problem.
