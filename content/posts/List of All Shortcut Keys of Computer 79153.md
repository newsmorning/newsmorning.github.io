To navigate and carry out tasks in the computer software, shortcut keys help to offer a simpler and faster manner. On computers that are compatible with IBM, the Alt key, Command key (for Apple users), Ctrl key, or Shift key are used in combination with another key to operate shortcut keys. Including the modifier key, the plus sign, and a second key when describing a shortcut is the de facto industry standard.

By scanning for underlined characters in their menus, you may also locate the shortcut keys for well-known apps.
