If you own a Macbook Pro 15, you might have noticed that its battery isn't lasting as long as it used to - or worse, it's dying after just three days of use. What's going on with the A1398 Simplo battery that Apple is using in these laptops?

The Simplo battery is a relatively new addition to the Macbook Pro lineup, replacing the older LG and Sanyo batteries. According to Apple, the Simplo battery is more efficient and provides longer battery life than its predecessors.

However, many users are reporting that their Macbook Pro 15 with the Simplo battery is experiencing battery drain issues, even when the laptop is in sleep mode or not in use. Some users have reported that their battery is draining at a rate of 1% per hour, which is much faster than the expected rate of around 0.1% per hour.

So, what is causing this battery drain issue? After conducting extensive research and gathering user feedback, it seems that the issue lies in the power management system of the Simplo battery.

The Simplo battery has a different power management system than the older LG and Sanyo batteries. This new system is designed to be more efficient, but it appears to have a flaw that causes the battery to drain faster than it should.

Apple has not officially acknowledged the issue, but there are a few things you can do to try and fix the battery drain problem. One solution is to reset the System Management Controller (SMC). This can be done by shutting down your Macbook, then holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys, along with the power button, for 10 seconds. Release all the keys and start up your Macbook Pro again.

Another solution is to calibrate your battery. This involves fully charging your battery, then using it until it completely runs out of power, and then fully charging it again. This can help reset the power management system and improve battery life.

If these solutions don't work, Apple might need to release a software update to fix the battery drain issue. In the meantime, you can try to conserve your battery life by reducing the brightness of your screen, turning off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use, and closing any unnecessary apps or processes.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing battery drain issues with your Macbook Pro 15, it's likely due to the power management system of the Simplo battery. While there are some solutions you can try, such as resetting the SMC or calibrating your battery, you might need to wait for Apple to release a software update to fix the issue. Until then, take steps to conserve your battery life, and keep an eye out for any updates from Apple on this topic.

## Chosen Solution
 This is sounding awfully similar to what happened here: I changed my A1398 battery last week, with the iFixit kit
Everything went well then 3 days later the computer suddenly shuts down and stays dead. The battery is charging, a SMC reset shows the LED changing colour, it just won’t turn on. Disconnecting the battery doesn’t help.
I have to wait a few hours before being able to power it on again, only to see it die again after a couple minutes.
Would that be the battery that killed the logic board? I’m using an original magsafe charger.
Edit: I managed to boot it long enough to run CoconutBattery, before it died again. Actually a Simplo battery

 I don’t see a battery issue here, so that’s good! As you didn’t have the system under charge I can’t tell you what’s happening with the charging logic. Allow the systems charge to drop below 60% and then plug in your charger give it a few minutes to start the charging cycle and take a second snapshot.
As to the sudden shutdown, You’ll need to look deeper using the onboard diagnostics for starters: Restart the system and pressing the D key to enter. Did you get any errors?
