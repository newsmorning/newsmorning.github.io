Title: You Won't Believe What's Happening When This Samsung S8 Plus Gets Plugged Into a Car - Charging Nightmare!

Introduction:

Owning a Samsung S8 Plus is every tech geek's dream come true. With its sleek design and versatile features, the S8 Plus has become a popular choice for smartphone users. However, a recently discovered charging issue has left many Samsung users disappointed and frustrated.

Body:

The problem arises when the Samsung S8 Plus is plugged into a car charger. Instead of charging the phone, it drains the battery, leaving the user stranded with a dead phone. This bizarre issue has been widely reported on different Samsung forums by various users.

Many have speculated that the issue could be due to the compatibility of the charger, the phone, or the car's power supply mechanism. However, no concrete evidence has been found to support the claims.

The issue has caused distress to drivers who rely on their phone for navigation, communication, and entertainment during long drives. This unexpected charging nightmare has left them vulnerable to accidents, delays, and frustration.

Samsung has acknowledged the issue and has released a statement advising users to use an original Samsung charger and cable. They also mentioned that third-party cables, chargers, and car adapters may not be compatible with the phone and could cause the problem.

While this is a step in the right direction, it is not a fool-proof solution. Many users have reported experiencing the issue even with original Samsung chargers.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Samsung S8 Plus charging nightmare is a frustrating issue that has left many users perplexed. With no clear explanation of the problem, it's hard to know what the exact cause is and how to fix it.

If you're a Samsung S8 Plus user, the best advice would be to carry a backup charger or power bank to avoid being caught off guard. Also, ensure that you use an original Samsung charger and cable whenever possible.

Hopefully, the root cause of the problem will be discovered soon, and a permanent solution will be found so that Samsung users can enjoy their phones without any charging nightmares.

## Chosen Solution
 When i try to charge my S8 plus in my car using usb cable instead of charging its taking off my charge, it used to work fine till 3 months ago and i don’t remember doing anything new with my phone or car.  I even tried with my original cable that i got with phone but its still the same but it works fine inside the home even with the usb cable that i bought to charge in my car.  wonder does anyone had this issue and how its resolved….

 If your car USB port isn't charging your phone, the problem could be with the port, the cable, or even the phone. Not all car USB ports are designed to charge phones, or power peripheral devices at all, so there's a chance that you're dealing with that type of situation.

 It sounds like a blown fuse in the car.  Check your fuses for the USB charging port or cigarette lighter of the car, depending on where you have the phone plugged in to charge. The fuses are typically located under the hood, on the left of the driver just below the dash or in the dash, and sometimes you need OR to identify whether or not the USB port or cigarette lighter are working, try plugging in another device that is known to work.
There’s another item to touch base on here which is the charge cable itself. While this may not be at fault here, it is always recommended to use only original equipment charge adapters and USB cables. I have seen generic/cheap chargers work fine sometimes and others have completely fried the cable, the charge port of the phone, or the charging chip on the logic board of the phone.
