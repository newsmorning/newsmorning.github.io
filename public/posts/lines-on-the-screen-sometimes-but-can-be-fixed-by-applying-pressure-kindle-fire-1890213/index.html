These lines can be different in color and size, and they can distract you while reading, watching videos, or playing games on your device. Fortunately, there is an easy fix that doesn’t require any technical skills or expensive tools: applying pressure.\nHere is how you can do it:\nTurn off your Kindle Fire First of all, make sure your Kindle Fire is turned off. This is important to avoid damaging your screen or your device. You can either press and hold the power button until the screen goes black, or go to Settings \u003e Device Options \u003e Power Off and tap on it.\nApply pressure on the screen Next, place your thumb or finger on the top left corner of the screen (or any other corner) and press gently but firmly. Hold the pressure for about 20-30 seconds, then release. Repeat this process for each corner of the screen, and also for the middle of the screen.\nYou can use a soft cloth or a microfiber towel to protect your screen from fingerprints or scratches, but don’t use too much force or any sharp tools. The idea is to apply enough pressure to realign the pixels that are causing the lines, but not to break or bend your screen.\nTurn on your Kindle Fire After you have applied pressure on all corners and the middle of the screen, turn on your Kindle Fire and check if the lines are gone. If they are still there, repeat the process or try a different pressure point. If they are gone, congratulations! You have just fixed your Kindle Fire screen without spending any money or time on repairs.\nWhy does this work?\nThe lines on your Kindle Fire screen can be caused by various factors, such as temperature changes, impact, or moisture. When the pixels that form the image on your screen get out of alignment, they can create vertical or horizontal lines that intersect with the image.\nBy applying pressure on different points of the screen, you are essentially pushing the pixels back into place. This can also help to redistribute the liquid crystals that are responsible for displaying the colors and contrast on your screen.\nHowever, keep in mind that this method might not work for all types of screen issues, such as cracks, dead pixels, or backlight bleeding. If your Kindle Fire screen is severely damaged or if you don’t feel comfortable applying pressure on it, consider contacting Amazon customer support or a professional repair service.\nIn conclusion, applying pressure can be a simple and effective way to fix those pesky lines on your Kindle Fire screen. Just remember to turn off your device, use gentle but firm pressure, and test your screen after each pressure point. With a little bit of patience and experimentation, you can enjoy a clear and smooth viewing experience on your Kindle Fire again.\nChosen Solution Recently my Kindle Fire, which is less than a year old, has started having problems with the screen. Sometimes lines and colors and screen fading from white to black make the device unusable. Yet other times the device works perfectly fine. I have never dropped the device and it has been in a case from day 1, so nothing has happened as a result of external damage. It actually has pretty light usage overall. But I started messing around with it today to see if I could isolate the issue, and I found out a curious (albeit very temporary) remedy. Whenever the screen stops working properly, I can ‘fix’ it by applying pressure to the back of the device with my fingers while I’m using it. It doesn’t take much and the screen comes back with the picture and starts working properly again. As soon as I release the pressure, the lines and fading start again. To me, this indicates that something is not properly connected between the hardware and the LCD. Maybe something came loose? I could try to open it up and poke around, but I don’t really know what I’m looking for. Can anyone offer some advice on how to fix this problem? I’d appreciate it!\nHi @funkymunkey , I suggest that you verify the purchase date of the tablet and if it is less than 12 months since the date of purchase, that you consult the manufacturer’s warranty statement that came with the documentation for the tablet (it is usually found in the User Guide) and then follow the instructions as to what you have to do to make a claim for a manufacturer’s warranty repair or replacement. If the tablet is still covered by the warranty period it is not a good idea to open the tablet to find the cause of the problem as this will void the warranty. If you can’t find the warranty statement here is a link\n","wordCount":"845","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Houston"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/lines-on-the-screen-sometimes-but-can-be-fixed-by-applying-pressure-kindle-fire-1890213/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You won't believe how simply applying pressure can completely fix those pesky lines on your Kindle Fire screen!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 13, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;845 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mary Houston</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Simply Applying Pressure Can Completely Fix Those Pesky Lines on Your Kindle Fire Screen!</p><p>If you are a Kindle Fire user, you might have experienced the frustration of having your screen filled with lines.
