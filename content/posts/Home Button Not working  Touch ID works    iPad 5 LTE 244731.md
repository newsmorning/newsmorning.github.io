# Is Your iPad 5 LTE Possessed? Find Out Why the Home Button Refuses to Work While Touch ID Functions Perfectly!

If you own an iPad 5 LTE and have been experiencing issues with the Home button, you're not alone. Many users have reported that their Home buttons have become unresponsive, despite the Touch ID sensor still functioning normally. At first glance, it might seem as though your iPad is possessed, but fear not – there could be a logical explanation for the problem.

Before diving into the issue, it's important to understand the difference between the Home button and the Touch ID sensor. The Home button is a physical button located at the bottom of your iPad's display that, when pressed, takes you back to the home screen. It also serves other functions, such as allowing you to access Siri and the App Switcher. The Touch ID sensor is a fingerprint scanner that allows you to unlock your iPad and make purchases using your fingerprint.

Now, onto the issue at hand. One possible explanation for the unresponsive Home button is a software glitch. If there was an issue with the software on your iPad, it could cause the Home button to stop working while the Touch ID sensor still functions normally. To troubleshoot this issue, try restarting your iPad or performing a hard reset by holding down the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button simultaneously for ten seconds. If this doesn't fix the problem, you may need to restore your iPad to its factory settings.

Another potential cause of the issue is hardware damage. If there has been any physical damage to your iPad, such as dropping it or exposing it to moisture, it could cause the Home button to stop working. In this case, your only option is to take your iPad to a repair shop or contact Apple support for assistance.

It's also worth noting that the issue with the Home button could be related to how you're using your iPad. If you're someone who frequently uses your iPad in landscape mode, you may find that the Home button becomes harder to press. This is because the orientation of the iPad causes the Home button to be positioned further away from your thumb. If this is the case, try using your iPad in portrait mode instead.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing issues with the Home button on your iPad 5 LTE, it's not necessarily a sign that your device is possessed. It could be a software glitch, hardware damage, or simply a matter of how you're using your device. By following the troubleshooting steps outlined above, you should be able to determine the root cause of the issue and get your iPad back to full functionality in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, i have an iPad 2017 (5. Gen with LTE) where Touch ID works flawlessly,  but not the click itself. The home button does mechanical click, but the ipad does not react to it. I’m using the ipad with assisitive Touch at the momemt.
I got the ipad used already with this issue, so i dont know what could have caused this.
Is there anything i can do to get the home button working again?

 It could be due to a loose home button cable, you may need to reseat the cable properly.
To do that, you need some tools to remove glass digitizer, I believe iFixit has posted a guide for this.
