File system errors or bad sectors on your computer's hard disk can have far-reaching repercussions. Use the Check Disk command to detect and correct errors and bad sectors, which could be causing Windows Explorer to crash.


6. Stop Services that Aren't Needed

Services running in the background or on startup can significantly slow down, or even crash, Windows Explorer. Use the Services management console to disable services that are not crucial for your system's operation.

To fix it, you can turn on the option that assigns a unique process to each folder you open in the Explorer.
 
- Search for File Explorer Options in Cortana search and launch it.

The Windows Explorer keeps crashing issue could also be the result of a third-party app interfering with the workings of the utility. While most apps won’t do that, there are certain types of programs such as antivirus ones that are known to cause conflicts with the built-in Windows tools.
 
And if that’s the case, fixing the issue is extremely easy. All you basically need to do is close any running antivirus programs on your computer and you’re good to go. These programs will then not be able to touch any parts of the Explorer and that should fix the issue for you.
