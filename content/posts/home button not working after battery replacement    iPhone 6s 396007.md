Introduction

Apple has released several models of its popular iPhone, and the iPhone 6S is undoubtedly one of the most popular models. However, if you're wondering whether it's safe to repair the iPhone 6S home button, there's a warning you should pay attention to that could prove costly if ignored. 

Warning: Your iPhone 6S Home Button Could Break Permanently After THIS Repair!

The iPhone 6S home button is a critical part of your device's hardware, and if it develops a fault or becomes unresponsive, it can be costly to repair. For this reason, many iPhone users prefer to do their repairs, and the popular YouTube channel, "JerryRigEverything," has provided an instructional video on how to fix this problem. 

However, there's a critical warning that users of this video should take into account before proceeding with this repair. Youtube's warranty fix may look like a cost-effective and beneficial solution, but unfortunately, it has a significant downside. If you attempt this repair at home, your home button may become permanently damaged and unusable. 

Why Can Your Home Button Break Permanently?

The iPhone 6S home button is integrated with a unique and essential Touch ID sensor. Apple has designed this feature to maximize security and ensure that only you will be able to access your iPhone. However, this sensor is attached to the phone's logic board, which means that any form of repair that involves removing the home button can cause permanent damage and lead to Touch ID sensor failure. 

In the Youtube video above, the host of JerryRigEverything demonstrates how to fix the iPhone 6S home button problem by swapping out the button and its attached cable. However, the downside of this repair is that the Touch ID sensor is also removed from the home button in the process, which renders the sensor entirely null and void. This means that not only will Touch ID no longer function, but various other critical features will also become inoperative, such as Apple Pay.

What Are Your Options?

It's crucial to understand the risk involved before attempting to repair your iPhone 6S home button yourself. While DIY repair can be a tempting and cost-effective option, it can lead to the permanent failure of your Touch ID sensor, rendering various other essential features inoperative. 

Instead of following DIY instructions, we always advise that you bring your iPhone to a professional technician. They have the necessary tools, expertise, and knowledge to repair your home button safely and with minimal risk of permanent damage. They can help you ensure that your Touch ID sensor is not damaged in the process of fixing the home button, so you'll still be able to benefit from all the crucial features.

Conclusion

The iPhone 6S home button is an essential hardware function of your device, and it's best left to professionals when it comes to repairs. The important warning is to avoid the DIY repair and instead seek the assistance of a skilled technician. It may cost more but is the safest and wise choice to prevent more significant issues down the road.‌

 Hey guys i just changed my battery on my iphone 6s and my home button stopped working? i unplugged the ribbon cables everywhere and plugged them back in and nothing my home button still does not work. any ideas ?

 Hey guys! I have a problem with my iPhone 7. Its battery wa damage during charging. It gives me low battery timing. So, I replaced my battery. After that my iPhone’s home button does not working and show the pop up “ Touch id loads to fail on this iPhone”
What can I do?
Before battery replacement my iPhone wa properly working.

 Yes the flex cable or one of the connectors in that area to the screen is being pinched down to hard by the metal cover above it.  Loosen the 4/5 screws depending on your model that covers the cables and you should be fine.

 If phone is opened by someone other than apple the home button doesn’t work !
If anyone knows how to reset it please let me know !

 If you dont make a move or doesnt move the home button while installing the battery maybe the problem is you didnt put the lcd well to the housing :)

 The metal cover above the lcd cable is too tight.  Loosen it and then you should be okay.

 If you have a screen available, try it out in a new screen. The ribbon that runs from your button to the board is part of the screen (unfortunately). That ribbon being damaged would actually be the cheapest fix, so hopefully that helps. Replacing the button or the board would be expensive.

 Hi,
I took my 6S Plus in to a third party repair shop for loud speaker replacement; after repair, my home button started having problems, it was seldom working; i took it back to the shop, they replaced the home button, telling me that I will no longer have touch id; when asked what happened to the home button in the first place, they said it's common that the home button starts having problems. i'm having a lot of trouble accepting this shady information. the button was working perfectly fine; i take it in for repair, unrelated to the home button, and now my home button seldom works. this is an old phone that has been handed down to the kids, so not having touch id is fine, but still, this is some shady info and practice. i have taken my phones in to third party repair shops a few times and they've ALL been bad experiences. I don't know if the Apple store does these kinds of repairs but I will be going straight there next time I need something repaired.
