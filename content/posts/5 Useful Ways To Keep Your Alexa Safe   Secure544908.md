STOP! Your Alexa is at Risk - Discover 5 Essential Tips to Keep It Safe and Secure!

Alexa, the virtual assistant developed by Amazon, has transformed our homes into smart spaces. With its many features, such as setting timers, playing music, and controlling smart devices, Alexa has become a useful tool in our daily lives. However, with the rise of smart technology, security risks have also increased. Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to exploit the vulnerabilities in smart home devices, and Alexa is not an exception. So, to ensure the safety of your Alexa, here are five essential tips to keep it secure:

1. Secure your Wi-Fi network

One of the primary ways hackers gain access to your Alexa is through your Wi-Fi network. Therefore, it is essential to secure your Wi-Fi network by using a strong password and encryption. Use WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) encryption as it is the most secure and cannot be hacked easily. Also, ensure that you keep your Wi-Fi password updated regularly and avoid using predictable passwords.

2. Enable two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication adds an additional layer of protection to your Alexa account. It requires another form of verification, such as a code sent to your mobile phone, to access your account. With two-factor authentication, even if a hacker gains access to your password, they cannot access your account without the second authentication factor.

3. Limit voice purchasing

Alexa allows you to make purchases with your voice, which can be convenient but can also be risky, especially if malicious actors gain access to your Alexa account. To avoid this, you can limit voice purchases by setting up a PIN, which you have to enter before any purchases can be made. To set up this feature, go to the Alexa app and navigate to Settings > Alexa Account > Voice Purchasing and turn on Require confirmation code.

4. Turn off the microphone when not in use

Sometimes, Alexa might record conversations unintentionally, which can be a security risk if the content of the conversation is sensitive. To minimize this risk, turn off the microphone when you are not using Alexa. You can also delete your voice history by going to the Alexa app and navigating to Settings > History, where you can delete recordings from a specific time frame or delete all recordings.

5. Keep your Alexa app and devices updated

Finally, make sure you keep your Alexa app and devices updated with the latest software updates and security patches. These updates often contain bug fixes, improvements, and security enhancements that protect your Alexa device from potential threats.

In conclusion, your Alexa can be a useful tool in your home, but it can also pose security risks. Therefore, be proactive by implementing these five essential tips to keep your Alexa safe and secure. Secure your Wi-Fi network, enable two-factor authentication, limit voice purchasing, turn off the microphone when not in use, and keep your Alexa app and devices updated. By doing this, you can enjoy the benefits of a smart home without worrying about security threats.

But as hackers are consistently attacking our private lives by stealing our private data, don’t you think it’ll be great if we take up a few steps to keep our Alexa safe and secure. What if hackers get a hold on Alexa and start listening to all your private conversations? You sure don’t want that right? So, if you’re pretty concerned about your privacy here are a few steps to secure your Alexa enabled smart home speaker.
 
### 1. Protect your WIFI Network
 
The first and the right thing to do as soon as you setup your Alexa device is to secure the network on which it is connected. For starters, you can change the default WiFi name and password of your network and create a strong one which is quite tough to crack. And if it’s possible, create one separate WiFi network for all your Smart home devices and one different WiFi network for browsing Internet or shopping online etc. Apart from this, keep checking firmware updates regularly and keep all your devices up to date running on latest versions of software.
 
### 2. Replace the Wake Word
 
As you’re all aware, as soon as we use the wake word Alexa starts listening and recording to your voice. So, what we recommend is change the existing wake word and replace it with something unique, which we don’t commonly use in our daily conversations. If that doesn’t work and if you’re still skeptical then you can also disable the device’s microphone to stop it from listening entirely.

So, fellas, here were a few tips that can help your Alexa enabled device to be safe and secure. By following these few tips, you can stay protected from any security breach and keep your private and sensitive data away from cyber criminals.
