So much is going for the Infinix S3 that we honestly don’t know where to begin. Infinix marks a first for Infinix Mobility to sport the trendy 18:9 aspect ratio. It also comes with the latest Android Oreo.
 
What makes this device special though is none of that. That the Infinix S3 runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor is the cherry on the top. This marks the first time for a midrange device to sport the arguably pricier Qualcomm processors.
 
Infinix held nothing back in furnishing this beast with all the trendy bells and whistles and then some more. The S3 runs a 20 MP beast of a camera, a humongous battery to keep you mobile for as long as it takes and the latest Android Oreo to boot. Surely, what’s not to like?
 
Our review device dropped at our offices and we were giddy with excitement ever since. Here’s an unbiased unboxing and first impressions. What’s more, this is from someone who has used the S2 Pro. So expectations were rather high. Well then, let’s get right to it.

## The Good, The Bad, The Ugly
 
They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression. We couldn’t agree more. Even before delving deeper, the Infinix S3 will win you over by aesthetics alone. The device has a plastic polycarbonate finish with rounded edges. We had mixed reactions about this. One would argue that it’s a downgrade from the metallic premium finish of the S2 Pro.
 
The Infinix S3 shaves off a lot of bezels to maximise the screen area. The device squeezes all 5.7-inch Infinity Display in a small frame while retaining an impressive 81% screen to body ratio. In so doing, you won’t see much difference in size between a 5.2-inch Infinix S2 Pro and the Hot S. That’s great news for one-handed manoeuvrability.
 
Infinix markets the S3 as a selfie camera. The 20MP front camera and 13MP rear camera take crisp shots. We still don’t appreciate that the rear camera protrudes from the body. This necessitates always having a jacket/protective case.
 
Although we hadn’t tried it as of writing this post, Face ID alongside the Fingerprint scanner was a nice touch. On the flipside, I wonder if people who resemble would be able to spoof this. We will surely check this out later.
 
A non-removable 4000mAh battery will definitely take you through the day of regular usage. On the downside, Infinix hasn’t yet made the jump from Micro USB to USB Type C connectors. Micro USB is so yesteryear. But oh well, win some, you lose some.
 
## What we liked
 
- Less power hungry Qualcomm Processor
 - Packing 5.7 inches in small frame / 18:9 Infinity Display
 - 4000mAh Battery
 - 20MP/13MP selfie camera
 - Running the latest Android Oreo

 
## What we didn’t like
 
- Fully plastic Polycarbonate body
 - The old Micro USB port

 
## Price and where to buy
 
The Infinix S3 is currently retailing at UGX 685,000 in Infinix outlets in Uganda. Those accustomed to shopping online can give Jumia a go. Best bet is visiting Infinix stores littering the streets. Hit the steets, people!
