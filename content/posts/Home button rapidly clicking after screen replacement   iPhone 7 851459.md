As an iPhone 7 owner, you may have already experienced problems with your home button. But did you know that replacing your screen with a non-Apple replacement could trigger even more issues?

Recently, owners of the iPhone 7 who replaced their screens with third-party, aftermarket screens have been reporting erratic behavior from their home buttons. Some users have noted that their home button has stopped working altogether, while others have noticed that their button is less responsive and requires multiple taps to function properly.

This phenomenon is not new to the iPhone community. In the past, Apple has warned users against using third-party replacement parts, and for good reason. These parts are not manufactured to the same specifications as original Apple parts, and as a result, may not function correctly. In the case of the iPhone 7, this could result in not only a non-functional home button but also the inability to activate Touch ID.

The issues surrounding aftermarket replacement screens are not limited to home button dysfunction. Users have reported a variety of problems, including incorrect color calibration, screen burn-in, and even popping sounds emanating from the display.

While it may be tempting to save money by utilizing an aftermarket replacement screen, the potential problems that can arise may end up costing you much more than the price of an official Apple replacement.

So what should you do if you're experiencing issues with your iPhone 7's screen or home button? Contact Apple support and schedule an appointment at the Apple Store or an authorized service provider. Apple has implemented stricter security measures to detect third-party components, which means they may refuse to repair your device if it has been tampered with in any way.

In conclusion, if you want your iPhone 7 to function properly, it's always best to have it serviced by Apple or an authorized service provider. Using aftermarket replacement parts may be cheaper in the short run, but it's likely to cause more headaches in the long run. Don't take the risk. Protect your investment and ensure that your iPhone 7 runs smoothly by choosing to use only official replacement parts.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey guys. Just fixed a Iphone 7 screen. Normal process of moving over the front camera flex, speaker, lcd heat shield, and home button. Well when I finished it and pressed the home button it starts vibrating rapidly and opens recent apps. Nothing looks torn or bent so I dont know whats wrong. Any suggestions?

 I’d check the Taptic Engine to make sure  it is secure and make sure everything is grounded properly. Also,   go into the Touch ID settings to see if that has any impact. Good luck!

 Hello, i faced this trouble twice in a week with two different iphone7 with very badly damaged screen (and one with water damaged). They have been previously opened so i don t know if i did the mistake at least for one but for the water damaged the trouble was already present: the flex cable from the button (not from the touch id) is cut near the grounding pad


as a capacitive sensor the button sensor is driven using specific pulse to sense the capacity change due to finger: with the track cut… it sense using the second half of flex board. Most of such circuit have a automatic calibration mode and without real sensor area, the button become crazzy. I will try two have my button repair in microsoldering surgery…

 I had the same issue with an iPhone 7 on which was doing a back case swap. The original phone was badly damaged and the case was bent. I had ordered a new back case and swapped the motherboard and other parts. The touch ID works , but the home button would sometimes multiple-click. After trying different screens, swapping the taptic engine, I put the home button under the scope and found the slightest wear/tear on the cable where it folds in half.  I’m guessing that’s what is affecting it.

 Do you have another screen assembly to test with? It could be a faulty screen. I would also go back and reseat any connectors, and make sure the screws holding in the home button are not overtightened.

 Same problem here and I’m on my 3rd screen. After 1st screen, home button worked just fine but phone would randomly turn off usually while taking portrait photos but sometimes other times too. 2nd screen, home button stopped working but Touch ID was working fine. 3rd screen, rapid clicking but home button worked and Touch ID still worked. iPhone 7 Plus. I’m at a loss. No damage to any cables or connectors.

 the u10 chip has been damaged remove the cable with heat

 This is an issue with the haptic engine. Anything from minor bending or an unsecured connection and cause improper communication from the home button, to the haptic engine. If all is secured and well. You will need to replace the haptic engine. I have had to complete this repair several times. Fairly simple and a kit with tools can be obtained from amazon for about $25.00 There are severa turorials on YouTube for this repair.

 My home button if clicking by its self is so annoying!!

 iPhone 7 home key flex has been broken while changing screen, go to any professional shop it is easy to repair this problem as only a small secondary flex in home key damaged not primary big flex.

 U hv broken touch id small flex u hv to make 3 jumper now

 This happened to me. I opened the phone again, removed and repositioned/reinstalled the same button. Tinkered a little bit with the screws' tightness, and problem seemed to disappear. But I'm guessing some home button spares are just not the best anyway.
