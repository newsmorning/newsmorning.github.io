# You won't believe how easy it is to remove and repair the Quadcopter Gimbal on your 3Dr Iris Plus - Check out our foolproof guide now!

Are you looking for an easy-to-understand guide on fixing the Quadcopter Gimbal on your 3Dr Iris Plus? Look no further! We have created a foolproof guide that will help you with your Gimbal-related issues in no time.

**Step 1: Tools Required**

Before starting the repair process, make sure you have the following tools ready:

1. Phillips-head screwdriver
2. Tweezers
3. Soldering iron and solder
4. Replacement Gimbal

**Step 2: Gimbal Removal**

The first step is to remove the old or damaged Gimbal. Turn off the Quadcopter and remove the battery for safety. Then, remove the top cover of the Quadcopter by removing the screws around it with your Phillips-head screwdriver.

Locate the Gimbal, which is in between the landing gear. You will find 4 screws holding it in place. Use your screwdriver to unscrew them, and then gently remove the Gimbal.

**Step 3: Disassembling the Gimbal**

Once you remove the Gimbal, you will find a couple of circuit boards attached to it. Remove these carefully using a pair of tweezers, taking note of the wire connections.

Next, remove the camera from the Gimbal by unscrewing the screws holding it in place. Finally, disconnect the Gimbal cable from the Quadcopter, and remove it.

**Step 4: Repairing or Replacing the Gimbal**

Inspect the Gimbal closely for any signs of damage or wear and tear. If the damage is minimal, you may be able to repair it yourself. However, if the damage is severe, it's best to replace it entirely.

If you're repairing the Gimbal, start by cleaning the parts with alcohol and a clean cloth. Then use your soldering iron and new solder to fix any damaged connections.

As for replacing the Gimbal, all you have to do is insert the replacement Gimbal in place of the old one. Connect the wires back as they were before, and screw back the circuit boards, camera, and the Gimbal cable.

**Step 5: Testing**

After everything is back in place, put the Quadcopter back together and turn it on. Use the remote controller to check if the Gimbal is responding correctly. Test it by moving it up, down, left, and right to ensure everything is working correctly.

In conclusion, repairing or replacing a Gimbal may be a daunting task, but it's not as complicated as it seems. All you need is a bit of patience, the right tools, and our guide to guide you through the process. Give it a try, and you'll be surprised how easily you can fix a Gimbal-related issue on your 3Dr Iris Plus!
