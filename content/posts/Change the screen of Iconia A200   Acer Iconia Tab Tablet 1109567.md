Before we start, there are a few tools and materials that you'll need. Here's a quick list:

- A new screen (make sure it's compatible with your Acer Iconia Tab model)
- A screwdriver
- A plastic pry tool
- A hair dryer
- A clean cloth

Step 1: Turn off your tablet

The first thing you need to do is turn off your tablet and remove the battery. This will prevent any kind of electrical shock or damage to your device during the repair process.

Step 2: Remove the broken screen

Next, you'll need to remove the broken screen. To do this, take the plastic pry tool and carefully insert it between the screen and the casing. Slowly work your way around the screen, loosening it from the adhesive that holds it in place.

Be careful not to force the pry tool too hard or you might cause more damage to the screen or the device. Use the hair dryer to heat up the adhesive if it's difficult to remove.

Step 3: Install the new screen

Once you have removed the broken screen, it's time to install the new one. Connect the new screen to the cable connector, making sure it's snugly in place. Gently align the screen and press it down onto the adhesive.

Step 4: Reassemble your tablet

Now it's time to reassemble your tablet. Replace the battery and the back cover. Use the screwdriver to tighten the screws, making sure they're secure but not too tight.

Step 5: Test your tablet

Finally, turn on your tablet and test the new screen. Make sure it's working properly and that all the functions are working as they should. If everything looks good, then congratulations, you have successfully changed the screen of your Acer Iconia Tab tablet!

In conclusion, changing the screen of your Acer Iconia Tab tablet is a lot easier than you might think. With the right tools and techniques, you can do it yourself without paying for expensive repairs. So, don't wait any longer, go ahead and replace that cracked or broken screen on your tablet and get back to enjoying it like you did before.
