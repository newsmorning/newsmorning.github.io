## Chosen Solution
 my computer fan is loud noice and speed is high
but computer is working

 Try opening the computer and see if it is dusty, if so, grab you a can of compressed air and clean it out.
The fan is running fast because it is more then likely dirty inside...restricting air flow, making the system run hot.
