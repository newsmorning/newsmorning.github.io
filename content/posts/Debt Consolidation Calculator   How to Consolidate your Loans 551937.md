## Debt Consolidation Calculator
 
Debt consolidation is when the person who has borrowed money would like to merge its existing multiple loans that are bearing high rates of interest to low bearing rates of interest one which would be a consolidated loan and further, the person who has borrowed money could also apply their savings which are made monthly in repayment and hence will be able to save interest and will help reduce the debt burden. Here the debt consolidation calculator will make all such calculations easy.
 
### How to Calculate using the Debt Consolidation Loan Calculator?
 
Step #1 – First, find out the present value of the outstanding balances on the multiple loans
 
#### Debt Consolidation Calculator
 
[∑PV x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]
 
- ∑PV is the sum of present value of outstanding Balances
 - R is the new rate of interest
 - N is the remaining number of payments

 
Step #2  – Next would be to find out the new installment amount based on existing outstanding balances with a lower rate of interest using the below formula
 
Step #3 – Now calculate the period within which the debt can be paid off
 
Wherein,
 
- PV is the present value of Outstanding Balance∑PV is the sum of the present value of outstanding balancesL is the existing PaymentL’ is the new Paymenti is the old rate of interestR is the new rate of interestn is the frequency of paymentsN is the remaining number of paymentsnPVA is the number of periodical payments

 
### Debt Consolidation Loan Calculator Examples
 
#### Example #1
 
Suppose that Mr. X has two debts outstanding: one is for $45,987, and another one is for $15,788. The interest rate was quite high, so Mr. X decided to convert them into a consolidated loan for four years with a rate of interest of 9.75%.
 
Based on the given information, you are required to calculate the new installment amount of the consolidated debt
 
Solution:
 
- We have two loans outstanding one is for $45,987, and the second one is $15,788, and the total outstanding debt would be $61,775

 
- The rate of interest would be 9.75%/12, which is 0.81%

 
= [61,775 x 0.81% x (1+0.81%)^48] / [(1+0.81%)^48-1]
 
= $1,559.37
 
Hence, if Mr. X wishes to consolidate the loan, he must pay $1,559.37 monthly for four years.
 
#### Example #2
 
Sunita Williams has taken two loans and the details of which are given below:
 
Sunita has recently received an offer from the Bank to merge the debt into one, with the duration being the equivalent of the longest outstanding tenure. The current monthly installment she is paying is $619.88 and $913.07, respectively. The rate of interest offered is 9%.
 
Based on the given information, you must calculate the new installment amount of the consolidated loan and the tenure within which the debt can pay off fully.
 
We need to calculate the present valuePresent ValuePresent Value (PV) is the today's value of money you expect to get from future income. It is computed as the sum of future investment returns discounted at a certain rate of return expectation.read more of the current outstanding Debt balance, which can be calculated per the below formula:
 
#### Student Loan
 
- Rate of interest applicable on monthly basis = 11/12 = 0.92%

 
- The remaining period is seven years, which is 84 months.

 
= $619.88*[1-(1+0.92%)-84/0.92%]
 
= $36,202.50
 
#### Auto Loan
 
- Rate of interest applicable on monthly basis = 10/12 = 0.83%

 
- The remaining period is five years which is 60 months.

 
= $913.07 x [1 – (1+0.83%)-60 / 0.83%]
 
= $42,973.75
 
- Consolidated outstanding loan

 
= $36,202.50 + $42,973.75
 
= $79,176.25
 
- We will now calculate the new installment amount using the formula below, taking a new interest rate, which is (9%/12) 0.75%, tenure of the longest loan outstanding is 84 months.

 
= [79,176.25 x 0.75% x (1+0.75%)^84] / [(1+0.75%)^84-1]
 
= $1,532.94
 
#### Tenure within which to pay off a consolidated loan
 
- Now, we shall calculate within what period will the consolidated loan be cleared off

 
= In [{(1-79,176.25*(0.75%)/1,532.94}-1]/In(1+0.75%)
 
= 65.58 months
 
Hence, the debt can be cleared off within five and six months with a new installment.
