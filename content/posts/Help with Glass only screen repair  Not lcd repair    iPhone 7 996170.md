Title: You Won't Believe How Easy it Is to Fix Your iPhone 7 Screen With This Glass-Only Repair Method!

Are you tired of staring at that cracked iPhone 7 screen? Do you feel bad for being careless with it and letting it get damaged? Are you afraid to take it to a repair shop because of the cost and hassle involved? Fear no more! There is a revolutionary new glass-only repair method that can fix your iPhone 7 screen easily, quickly, and affordably. Let's dive into the details and discover the benefits of this game-changing solution.

First of all, let's clarify what we mean by "glass-only" repair. Traditional iPhone screen repairs involve replacing both the glass layer and the LCD layer that lies beneath it. This is a time-consuming and costly process that requires technical skills, specialized tools, and expensive parts. However, with a glass-only repair, you only have to replace the outer glass layer that is cracked or shattered, while keeping the original LCD intact. This is possible thanks to the separation of the glass and LCD layers on the iPhone 7, which allows for a much simpler and cheaper repair.

So, how does this glass-only repair method work? First, you need to order a glass replacement kit that includes a new piece of glass, adhesive, and tools. There are many reputable suppliers online that offer such kits at reasonable prices, often with free shipping and a warranty. Once you receive the kit, you can follow the detailed instructions provided to remove the damaged glass from your iPhone 7 and clean the surface. Then, you apply the adhesive and carefully align the new glass over the LCD, making sure there are no bubbles or dust particles trapped inside. Finally, you let the adhesive cure for a few hours, and voila! Your iPhone 7 screen looks brand new again.

What are the advantages of using this glass-only repair method? Here are some of the most notable benefits:

- Cost-effective: You can save up to 50% or more compared to traditional screen repairs, which can cost hundreds of dollars. A glass replacement kit usually costs less than $50 and takes less than an hour to complete.

- Quick turnaround: You don't have to wait for days or weeks to get your iPhone 7 back from a repair shop. You can fix it yourself at home, at your own pace, and without any downtime.

- Eco-friendly: Instead of throwing away your entire iPhone 7 or LCD screen, you can reuse the functional parts and reduce electronic waste. This is a smart and sustainable choice for the planet.

- Learn a new skill: If you are curious about how your iPhone 7 works and want to try your hand at DIY repair, this is a great opportunity to learn something new and gain confidence. You don't have to be a technical genius to do it, just follow the instructions and take your time.

- Support your local repair community: By choosing to repair your iPhone 7 yourself or at an independent repair shop, you are sending a message to Apple and other tech giants that you value your right to repair and want to support a more open and competitive market. You also help keep your money within your local economy and create jobs for skilled technicians.

In conclusion, fixing your iPhone 7 screen with a glass-only repair method is not only easy, but also smart, affordable, and sustainable. Don't let a cracked screen ruin your day or empty your wallet. Take matters into your own hands and give this DIY solution a try. You won't believe how satisfying it can be to see your iPhone 7 shine like new again. Happy repairing!

## Chosen Solution
 I have done many repairs before so I am not a total noob however I have just recently attempted to do a glass only screen repair on an iPhone 7, I got the glass of perfectly without problem but the glue that remains on the lcd seems impossible to get off without breaking the lcd even though im using 99.9% isopropyl alcohol. Any tips on how to overcome this? thanks in advanced.

 It could be that you are trying to take the polarizing layer off in which case you would have to fully remove it and buy a new polarizing layer. If not, try using acetone.
