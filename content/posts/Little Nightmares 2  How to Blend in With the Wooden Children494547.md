# Unleash Your Inner Survivalist with Little Nightmares 2's Secret Technique to Blend In with the Wooden Children!

Little Nightmares 2 is a suspenseful game that involves a lot of sneaking around and avoiding dangers. As you progress through the game, you'll come across various obstacles that require you to use your wits and cunning to survive. One of the key skills you'll need to master is blending in with your environment. And one of the best ways to do that is by using the wooden children.

So, what are the wooden children, and how can they help you survive in the game? In this article, we'll take a closer look at this secret technique and how you can use it to unleash your inner survivalist.

## What are the Wooden Children?

The wooden children are mysterious objects that you'll come across in Little Nightmares 2. They look like small, wooden dolls and come in various shapes and sizes. They're often found lying around or hanging from strings, and they blend in perfectly with the surrounding environment.

At first glance, the wooden children might seem like nothing more than creepy decorations. However, they serve a crucial role in helping you survive in the game. By using them to blend in with your surroundings, you can hide from enemies and avoid detection.

## How to Use the Wooden Children to Blend In

Using the wooden children to blend in is relatively simple. When you come across one, pick it up and hold it in your hands. Then, move slowly and carefully towards the enemy or obstacle you're trying to avoid. If done correctly, the enemy will ignore you and carry on with their business, thinking that you're just another wooden doll.

It's important to note that the wooden children only work when you're standing still or moving slowly. If you start running or jumping, the illusion will be broken, and the enemy will come after you.

## Tips for Using the Wooden Children

While using the wooden children to blend in is an effective technique, there are some tips and tricks you'll need to keep in mind to make the most of this strategy.

Firstly, pay close attention to your surroundings. Look for areas where the wooden children blend in naturally or make sense as part of the environment. For example, if you're in a forest, look for wooden dolls hanging from tree branches.

Secondly, make sure to time your movements carefully. Moving too quickly or abruptly can break the illusion, and you'll be detected by the enemy. Move slowly and deliberately, and only when you're sure it's safe to do so.

Lastly, remember that the wooden children are not invincible. Some enemies, such as the Teacher, can see through the wooden doll disguise. Be aware of these enemies and use other techniques, such as hiding behind objects or using distractions, to avoid detection.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Little Nightmares 2's secret technique of using the wooden children to blend in is a valuable skill to master. By unleashing your inner survivalist and learning how to use this technique effectively, you'll be able to navigate the game's many challenges and avoid danger. Remember to pay attention to your surroundings, time your movements carefully, and be aware of enemies that can see through the disguise. With these tips in mind, you can unlock the full potential of this secret technique and survive the nightmares that await you in Little Nightmares 2.
