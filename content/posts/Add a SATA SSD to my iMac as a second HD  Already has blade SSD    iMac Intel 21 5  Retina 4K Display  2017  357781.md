You Won't Believe What Happens When You Add a SATA SSD as a Second HD to your iMac! Transform your 2017 Intel 21.5 Retina 4K Display into a Speed Demon!

If you are looking to boost the performance of your iMac, adding a solid-state drive (SSD) as a second HD can work wonders. In this article, we will discuss how to add a SATA SSD to your iMac and the benefits you can expect.

Before we get into the specifics of adding a SATA SSD, let's first understand the difference between a hard disk drive (HDD) and an SSD. An HDD is a traditional storage device that uses spinning disks to store data, while an SSD uses flash memory to store data. The benefit of an SSD is that it has no moving parts, making it faster and more durable than an HDD.

Now that we understand the difference between the two, let's talk about how to add a SATA SSD to your iMac. The first thing you need to do is purchase a SATA SSD. You can find these at most computer stores, and they come in a variety of sizes and brands.

Once you have your SATA SSD, you need to open up your iMac. To do this, you will need a set of tools such as a screwdriver, pliers, and a plastic opening tool. Follow the instructions on how to remove the back panel, and carefully remove it.

Next, you will need to locate the second hard drive bay on your iMac. This is usually located beneath the optical drive, but it may vary depending on your specific iMac model. Once you have located it, you will need to remove any screws or cables in the way and install your SATA SSD into the bay.

Once your SATA SSD is installed, you will need to format it using the Disk Utility app. This will erase all the data on the SSD, so make sure you have backed up any important files beforehand.

Now that your SATA SSD is installed and formatted, you can start enjoying the benefits of a faster iMac. Your iMac will now have two hard drives, with the SSD acting as the primary drive, and the HDD acting as the secondary drive. This means that your iMac will boot up faster, load applications quicker, and perform better overall.

In conclusion, adding a SATA SSD as a second HD to your iMac can transform your 2017 Intel 21.5 Retina 4K display into a speed demon. Not only will you enjoy a faster iMac, but you will also have more storage space for your files. So go ahead, give it a try, and feel the difference for yourself!

## Chosen Solution
 I didn't find any upgrade kit for 2017 iMacs. I know for 21.5 SSD-only iMacs, there should be a standard SATA connector at the back of the logic board, but what about the power? Which power cable should I use? Also where should I get the rubber bumper? Any help is appreciated!!

 I agree with @mayer - I would wait until your warranty has expired. I also think you can get a better solution externally than adding in an internal 2.5" drive.
Just so you can see how much work it is review this IFIXIT guide: iMac Intel 21.5" Retina 4K Display (2017) Logic Board Replacement You'll need to get to Step61 so you can plug in the SATA & power cable on the back side of the logic board.
As far as the needed parts you can use the older 2015 SATA & power cables Apple is using the same cables here. The rubber cups are different which will be difficult to get presently.
