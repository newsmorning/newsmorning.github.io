Your iPod Touch might have been possessed, it might be malfunctioning, or it might just need some cleaning. But before dumping your iPod Touch and buying a new one, you should try some troubleshooting techniques to fix your home button.

## Causes of Home Button Sticking:

The root cause of the problem could be a hardware or a software issue. The possible causes of the home button sticking in the permanently pressed position are:

- Dirt, dust, or other particles getting stuck beneath the button.
- Software corruption preventing the button from functioning correctly.
- Water damage to the button itself or the circuitry.

## Fixes for the Home Button Sticking:

If you are facing a problem with your iPod Touch's home button getting stuck, then here are some fixes that might help you to solve the problem:

- Launch the Settings app.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I have an iPod Touch where the Home button is stuck in the pressed down position. The device still works normal though but it's annoying because I have press the button hard every time I want to return to the Home screen.
I was wondering if there is a way to 'unstuck' the button.
Thanks!
Steven.

 First the home button i had to press hard and now it doesn't work at all. Is there anyway I can fix it without buying a whole new one or it costing a lot of money. It's in great shape and I haven't had any other problems with it.

 You don't specify which model you have. That makes a big difference as to how to fix it. If you have the 2nd or 3rd generation I'd just recommend you buy a whole new front. You'll get a brand new scratchless screen, and it costs $10. It can be done in 15 minutes by someone experienced, or in 45 minutes if you've never done it before.
If you don't want to take it apart you might try getting an X-acto knife (http://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-Series-Knif...) and working around the edges of the button to try to get it to pop back up. But if something is damaged inside it might be better to replace the button itself or just replace the whole front.
