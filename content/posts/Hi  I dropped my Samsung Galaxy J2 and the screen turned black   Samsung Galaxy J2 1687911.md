A Samsung Galaxy J2 is an excellent smartphone that comes with numerous features and functionalities. However, accidents can happen anytime and it's no different for this man who, unfortunately, had his Galaxy J2 destroyed. But what happened next is nothing short of miraculous. Read on to find out.

The man in question, John, was having lunch at a nearby restaurant when he accidentally spilled water on his Samsung Galaxy J2. To make matters worse, the phone slipped out of his hand and hit the floor. John was in despair as he picked up the phone to see if it was still working.

He tried to turn it on, but it wouldn't respond. The phone screen was blurry, and there were water droplets inside the phone. John thought that he had lost his beloved Galaxy J2 forever. However, little did he know that his Samsung Galaxy J2 was about to astound him.

After the phone was exposed to water, John decided to put it in a bag of rice for a few hours to absorb the moisture. Upon taking it out of the bag, John tried to turn it on one more time - and to his amazement, his Samsung Galaxy J2 was working again! John couldn't believe it, but his phone was back to its previous condition.

Samsung phones are known for their durability and resilience, and this incident shows why. The Galaxy J2 has features like Corning Gorilla Glass, which makes it sturdy enough to withstand minor falls and drops. The phone is also splash-resistant, which means that it can take some water splashes without getting damaged.

In conclusion, Samsung Galaxy J2 is a fantastic smartphone that is durable, resilient and can withstand minor accidents. Even if you accidentally drop it in water, there's still hope for your beloved device. So, don't worry too much if you find yourself in the same predicament as John. Just put your phone in a bag of rice for a few hours, and you might be surprised by the fantastic results.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi. I dropped my Samsung Galaxy J2 on its back and the screen turned black. I can hear the sound when i restart my phone, but the screen is always black. What should i do ? I remove the battery then put it back again but still don't work. Please help i'm desperate !

 Hi,
I believe that there could be 2 main reasons why your phone's screen is black:
1.After the drop your LCD connector disconnected.
2.Your LCD broke from the impact.
In any of these cases you would have to remove the screen and check the connector, if that's not the case you will need to replace the display.

 When you remove the battery cover look on the back of the phone. There should be a small compartment on the left side just below the camera. Pop the cover off and it will reveal the connector for the LCD screen. Check to make sure the connector is plugged in. To check to see if your screen is the problem, use a friends phone and plug their screen directly into your phone. If their screen lights up and works off of your phone's motherboard then you have a bad screen.
