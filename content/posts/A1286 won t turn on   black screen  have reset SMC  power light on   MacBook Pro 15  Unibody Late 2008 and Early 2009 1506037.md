Title: Is Your MacBook Pro Possessed? Learn How to Revive Your A1286 with These Surprising Tips!

Are you experiencing problems with your MacBook Pro A1286? Are you feeling frustrated with the constant glitches, freezes, crashes, and slowdowns? If so, you're not alone. Many MacBook Pro users have reported issues with their machines, which can be caused by various factors.

However, before you give up on your MacBook Pro and buy a new one, the good news is that there are ways to revive your A1286 without breaking the bank. In this article, we'll share with you some surprising tips on how to restore your MacBook Pro's performance and functionality.

Tip #1: Check Your MacBook Pro's Battery

One of the most common causes of MacBook Pro issues is the battery. If your MacBook Pro's battery is old, damaged, or defective, it can cause various problems such as sudden shutdowns, freezing, and sluggish performance. Therefore, the first thing you should check is your MacBook Pro's battery health.

You can do this by clicking on the Apple menu, selecting "About This Mac," and then clicking on the "System Report" button. Next, click on "Power" in the left sidebar and look for the "Health Information" section. Here, you'll see the "Cycle Count" and "Condition" of your MacBook Pro's battery.

If your battery's cycle count is high (over 1000) and its condition is poor or "replace now," it's time to replace your battery. You can buy a genuine MacBook Pro battery from Apple or a third-party supplier and follow the instructions to replace it.

Tip #2: Clean Your MacBook Pro's Fans and Vents

Another possible cause of MacBook Pro issues is overheating. When your MacBook Pro's internal temperature exceeds the normal range, it can trigger the system to slow down or even shut down to avoid damage. One way to prevent overheating is to clean your MacBook Pro's fans and vents regularly.

To do this, shut down your MacBook Pro, unplug it, and flip it over. Look for the air vents on the bottom of your MacBook Pro and use a small brush or a can of compressed air to remove dust and debris that may be blocking the airflow. You can also use a specialized MacBook Pro cleaning kit if you prefer.

Tip #3: Update Your MacBook Pro's Software

Outdated software can also cause problems on your MacBook Pro. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your MacBook Pro's software is up to date by checking for available updates regularly. To do this, click on the Apple menu, select "System Preferences," and click on "Software Update."

If there are any updates available, install them and restart your MacBook Pro if necessary. This can help fix any bugs or glitches in the system, improve performance, and enhance security.

Tip #4: Reset Your MacBook Pro's System Management Controller (SMC)

The SMC is responsible for managing various functions on your MacBook Pro, such as power, thermal management, and battery charging. If the SMC is not working correctly, it can cause various issues, including slow performance and battery problems.

To reset your MacBook Pro's SMC, follow these steps:

- Shut down your MacBook Pro.
- Press and hold the left Shift + Control + Option keys on the keyboard and the Power button simultaneously.
- Release all the keys after a few seconds.
- Press the Power button to turn on your MacBook Pro.

Tip #5: Back up and Reinstall Your MacBook Pro's Operating System

If none of the above tips work, it's possible that your MacBook Pro's operating system may be corrupted. To fix this, you can back up your data and perform a clean install of the operating system. This can help eliminate any software-related issues and restore your MacBook Pro's performance to its original state.

To do this, follow these steps:

- Back up your data using Time Machine or any other backup software.
- Restart your MacBook Pro and hold down the Command + R keys until you see the Apple logo.
- Select "Reinstall macOS" from the options and follow the on-screen instructions.
- Restore your data from the backup.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're experiencing problems with your MacBook Pro A1286, don't panic. There are ways to revive your machine and restore its performance and functionality. By following these surprising tips, you can avoid spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a new MacBook Pro and enjoy using your current one for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 MacBook Pro A1286. Removable battery and hard drive.Battery charges fine. LED indicators show charge level. Power adaptor shows orange when charging, green when charged.When turning on, power LED lights up, the chime can be heard, but nothing on the screen (no flashes, etc.). Keyboard backlight does not light up; caps lock key does not light up when pressed.
What I've tried:
Have reset SMC with and without taking the battery out first; charging cable responds with green lightHave tried holding Command-Option-P-R startup as suggested in another threadHave plugged a HDMI cable in to a TV, but nothing shows

 Not much to work with here. There are just to many possibilities. I think you’ll need to find someone local who has a good knowledge of the MacBook Pro’s to see what they say. It could be simple or it could be expensive if the logic board is bad.
