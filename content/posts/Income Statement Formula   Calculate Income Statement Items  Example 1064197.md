# Discover the Secret Formula for Calculating Income Statement Items - Boost Your Finances with This Example!

If you're a business owner or you're learning about finance, then you've probably heard about the income statement. This financial statement shows you how much revenue you've generated and how much you've spent to generate it. It's a critical document that helps you understand your company's financial health and make informed decisions.

But while it's easy to read an income statement, calculating the individual items can be daunting if you're not familiar with the formula. In this article, we'll take you through the secret formula for calculating income statement items with an example, so you can learn how to boost your finances:

## The Income Statement Formula

The income statement is broken down into several categories of items, such as revenue, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses. Each category has its formula for calculating the item.

## Example: Calculating Revenue

Let's start with revenue, which is the total amount of money your business has generated from selling goods and services. The formula for calculating revenue is:

    Revenue = Quantity Sold x Price per Unit

For example, let's say you're running a coffee shop, and you sell 500 cups of coffee for $2.50 each. Then your revenue would be:

    Revenue = 500 x $2.50
    Revenue = $1,250

## Example: Calculating Cost of Goods Sold

The next item on the income statement is the cost of goods sold, which is the cost of producing the goods you've sold. The formula for calculating cost of goods sold is:

    Cost of Goods Sold = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory

For example, let's say you're running a grocery store, and you have $10,000 worth of goods at the beginning of the year. Over the year, you purchase $50,000 worth of goods, and at the end of the year, you have $20,000 worth of goods remaining. Then your cost of goods sold would be:

    Cost of Goods Sold = $10,000 + $50,000 - $20,000
    Cost of Goods Sold = $40,000

## Example: Calculating Operating Expenses

Operating expenses are the costs of running your business, such as rent, salaries, and utilities. The formula for calculating operating expenses is:

    Operating Expenses = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs

For example, let's say you're running a bakery, and your fixed costs are $5,000 per month, while your variable costs, such as ingredients and wages, are $2,000. Then your operating expenses would be:

    Operating Expenses = $5,000 + $2,000
    Operating Expenses = $7,000

## Example: Calculating Net Income

Net income is the bottom line on your income statement. It's the amount of money you've earned after deducting all your expenses. The formula for calculating net income is:

    Net Income = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses

For example, let's say you're running a pizza shop, and your revenue for the year is $100,000. Your cost of goods sold is $30,000, and your operating expenses are $50,000. Then your net income would be:

    Net Income = $100,000 - $30,000 - $50,000
    Net Income = $20,000

## Conclusion

Now that you've seen the formulas for calculating income statement items, you have a better understanding of how your business finances work. By tracking your income and expenses, you can make better-informed decisions about your company's future. So, go ahead and use these formulas to boost your finances!

Net Income = Revenues – Expenses
 
In the case of multiple steps, first, the gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods soldCost Of Goods SoldThe Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is the cumulative total of direct costs incurred for the goods or services sold, including direct expenses like raw material, direct labour cost and other direct costs. However, it excludes all the indirect expenses incurred by the company.

- Firstly, the profit and loss statement has to note the total of all the revenue-generating sources.  Next, determine the cost of goods sold from the profit and loss account. The cost of goods sold primarily includes raw material costs. In this step, the gross profit can be calculated by deducting the cost of goods sold from the revenues. It is as shown below: Gross profit = Revenues – Cost of goods sold Next, the operating expenses are also collected from the income statement. Operating expenses primarily include selling expenses, administrative expenses, etc. In this step, the operating income can be calculated by deducting operating expenses from the gross profit, as shown below. Operating income = Gross profit – Operating expenses Next, determine the non-operating items such as interest income, one-time settlements, etc. Finally, the net income calculation is done by adding the net of non-operating items (= non-operating income – non-operating expense) to the operating income, as shown below. Net income = Operating income + Non-operating items

 

 
Gross profit = Revenues – Cost of goods sold
 
Operating income = Gross profit – Operating expenses
 
Net income = Operating income + Non-operating items

Operating Income for 2016 will be –
 
Operating Income for 2016 = $60,024
 
Net Income
 
Therefore, Net Income can be calculated as,
 
=$60,024 Mn + $1,348 – $15,685
 
Net Income for 2016 will be –
 
Net Income for 2016 =$45,687
