Well, get ready because Little Nightmares II is about to drop in February 2021, and it’s going to be an unforgettable experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\nFor those who don’t know, Little Nightmares is a puzzle-platform horror game developed by Tarsier Studios and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game is set in a surreal world that feels like a bad dream. The main goal of the game is to help a little girl named Six escape from the Maw - a massive underwater vessel that’s inhabited by grotesque creatures.\nThe game’s unique art style and haunting gameplay made it an instant success when it was released in 2017. Fans have been eagerly waiting for a sequel ever since, and now, we finally have what we’ve been asking for.\nLittle Nightmares II follows the story of a new character named Mono, a young boy trapped in a distorted world ruled by a sadistic teacher named the “Hunter.” Along the way, Mono meets Six, the protagonist from the first game, and the two must work together to escape the Hunter’s clutches.\nThe recently released gameplay trailer for Little Nightmares II showcases the game’s exquisite graphics and bone-chilling ambience. The game is set to be even more unsettling than its predecessor, with new and terrifying monsters to avoid and puzzles to solve. The trailer features scenes of Mono sneaking past disturbing creatures, such as a deformed, axe-wielding teddy bear and a towering, dark figure.\nThe trailer also gives us a glimpse of the game’s various gameplay mechanics, such as traps and environmental puzzles that add to the game’s tension. Along the way, Mono and Six will navigate through forests, dilapidated buildings, and rocky landscapes as they try to find a way out of this twisted world.\nLittle Nightmares II is not just any horror game; it’s an experience that will stay with you long after you’ve finished playing it. It’s full of eye-catching set pieces and terrifying creatures that will have you jumping out of your skin. The game is set to release on February 11, 2021, and it’s available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, and PC. Prepare to be terrified when Little Nightmares II drops, and get ready for an unforgettable adventure filled with horror, mystery, and suspense.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, Little Nightmares II is shaping up to be one of the most memorable horror games of 2021. The gameplay trailer has set the expectations high, and it will be exciting to see how the final product turns out. It’s a game that will keep you engaged from start to finish, and it’s perfect for horror enthusiasts who love a good puzzle-solving challenge. Fans of the first game should definitely mark their calendars for February 11, 2021, as this game promises to be something truly special. Get ready to be terrified when Little Nightmares II drops, and let the world of creepiness and darkness take you on a haunting journey.\nLittle Nightmares II will debut on current-gen platforms in February 2021.\nAt the Opening Night Live Gamescom 2020, Namco Bandai has announced the release date of the expected Little Nightmares II, also showing a gameplay trailer.\nLittle Nightmares II will be available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on February 11, 2021, and will also debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X “later” in 2021.\nThe game will take control of Mono, a young boy trapped in a distorted world and who will be accompanied by Six, the protagonist of the first game, and controlled by the computer in this new chapter. Players will have to work together with Six to solve puzzles, uncover the game’s darkest secrets and escape its monstrous habitats, such as the terrifying Hunter or the grotesque Teacher.\n“We are really excited to finally be able to show more about Little Nightmares II, a year after the announcement at gamescom 2019,” said Lucas Roussel, Producer of Little Nightmares II. “We wanted to spend more time on the game and give it even more love, so we could create the best possible experience to delight our passionate fans.”\nAs mentioned at the beginning, you can see the full game in the coming year. A trailer is already available today, which you can watch below. More news will be shown on Friday during gamescom Studio, with some sections of the first level, Wilderness, being revealed for the first time.\nSource\n","wordCount":"799","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kenneth Pullen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/little-nightmares-ii-will-release-on-february-2021-new-gameplay-trailer-showcased-1099960/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Prepare to Be Terrified: Little Nightmares II Drops in February 2021 with an Unforgettable Gameplay Trailer!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 4, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;799 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kenneth Pullen</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>TITLE:
