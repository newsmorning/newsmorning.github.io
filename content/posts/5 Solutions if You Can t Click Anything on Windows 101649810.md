If you're one of the many Windows 10 users who are experiencing the frustrating issue of not being able to click anything on the screen, you're not alone. This issue is known as the Windows 10 click problem and it's caused by a variety of factors.

Many users have reported that they are unable to click on any icons, settings, or links on their Windows 10 computer. Fortunately, there are a number of quick fixes you can try to get your computer back up and running again. Here are five potential fixes that you can try right now.

## 1. Check Your Mouse Settings

One of the most common causes of the Windows 10 click problem is mouse settings. It's possible that your mouse settings have been changed, causing your computer to not respond to clicks. To check your mouse settings:

- Click on the Windows Start Menu and select "Settings".

- Click on "Devices" and select "Mouse".

- Make sure that the mouse is enabled and that the button settings are correct.

Once you've checked your mouse settings, try clicking something on your screen to see if the issue has been fixed.

## 2. Restart Your Computer

It's a classic fix, but it works. Restarting your computer can help reset any software or settings that may be causing the Windows 10 click problem. To restart your computer:

- Click on the Windows Start Menu and select the Power icon.

- Click on "Restart" and wait for your computer to reboot.

Once your computer has restarted, check to see if you can click on anything.

## 3. Run the SFC Scan

The SFC (System File Checker) scan is a built-in Windows tool designed to scan and repair any corrupted system files that could be causing the Windows 10 click problem. To run the SFC scan:

- Click on the Windows Start Menu and type "cmd".

- Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator".

- Type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter. Wait for the scan to complete.

Once the scan is complete, restart your computer and check to see if you can click on anything.

## 4. Update Your Drivers

Outdated drivers can also cause the Windows 10 click problem. To update your drivers:

- Click on the Windows Start Menu and type "Device Manager".

- Expand the category of the device that you want to update.

- Right-click on the device and select "Update Driver".

- Follow the prompts to update the driver.

Once you've updated your drivers, restart your computer and check to see if you can click on anything.

## 5. Perform a System Restore

If none of the above fixes work, you can try performing a system restore. This will restore your computer to a previous point in time when it was working correctly. To perform a system restore:

- Click on the Windows Start Menu and type "System Restore".

- Select "System Restore" from the results.

- Follow the prompts to restore your system to a previous point in time.

Once the restore is complete, check to see if you can click on anything.

In conclusion, the Windows 10 click problem can be frustrating, but there are a number of quick fixes you can try to get your computer back up and running. By checking your mouse settings, restarting your computer, running the SFC scan, updating your drivers, or performing a system restore, you can solve this issue and get back to using your computer without any problems.

For example, several users have reported that they can’t click anything after booting up the computer or when in the middle of something.
 
Using a GUI-based operating system like Windows is exceedingly difficult without a touchpad or mouse. The issue is even more common among users who use an external mouse device.
 
This error can occur if the Windows Explorer has crashed or if you have an old Windows build with a glitch installed. 
 
This article has listed some troubleshooting tips to help you resolve the can’t click anything issue in Windows 10 and 11.
 
## Why can’t I click on anything with my mouse?
 
Once you run into this error, here are the most common causes:
 
- A crash of Windows Explorer – This affects many operations in the computer, including cursor movements and clicks
 - A broken mouse – Here is an excellent place to start because no fix will work if the mouse is broken
 - Corruption of System files – Corrupt files may freeze your computer and sometimes hinder the mouse from clicking
 - Pointing device drivers issues – A quick update of device drivers should be your best bet here
 - Incompatible third-party apps – Not all apps work perfectly on you; if you have one that counter-reacts, it may stop your ability to click on the mouse

 
Also, you may note that this problem may come in a few variations. Users have complained of the following:
 
- You can’t click on certain parts of the screen in Windows 11
 - Can’t click on the desktop or taskbar in Windows 10
 - Windows 10 mouse not clicking until Task Manager is opened
 - Can’t click anything on the desktop
 - Can’t click on desktop icons in Windows 10

 
Regardless of the situation, you should check out these fixes to get you back on track.
 
#### Why is my laptop cursor not clicking?
 
If your laptop cursor is not clicking, it might be because it has been turned by some keyboard combination mistakenly.
 
Also, the problem might be due to broken or outdated mouse drivers.
 
## What to do if I can’t click anything in Windows 10?
 
### 1. Restart the explorer.exe process
 
- Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open the Task Manager. Alternatively, press Ctrl + Alt + Delete, navigate to the Task Manager using the Tab key, then press Enter.
 - Press the Tab key until one of the processes is selected.
 - Use the Down Arrow key on your keyboard to select Windows Explorer.
 - Since the right-click is not working, we will use Shift + F10 (shortcut for right-click) to bring up the context menu.
 - Use the Down Arrow key and select End task, then click Enter.
 - Once the explorer.exe process is killed, you may see a black screen for a short time.
 - Press the Windows key + R, type explorer.exe, and hit Enter.
 - This will relaunch your Windows Explorer. Next, try using the mouse to click anything to see if the issue is resolved.

 
If your Windows Explorer has crashed or frozen, it may lead to the can’t click anything issue in Windows 10 and 11. However, ending and restarting the explorer.exe process can resolve this problem.
 
### 2. Check your keyboard for issues
 
Faulty keyboard keys can prevent the mouse from performing the right-click and left-click actions.
 
Check if your keyboard if it has any broken keys or long-hold keys that are pressed without your knowledge.
 
Spacebar is one of the standard keys to break or get stuck on your keyboard. So first, make sure the keys are working fine.
 
You may also unplug the keyboard and restart your computer to see if the mouse and clicking functions work.
 
Check the keyboard for faulty keys if the mouse works without a keyboard connected to your computer.
 
### 3. Check for pending Windows updates
 
- Press the Windows key on your keyboard and type update; use the Arrow key to scroll to Check for updates, then hit Enter.
 - In the Windows Update section, use the Tab key to navigate.
 - Select Download updates or the Download & Install option and hit Enter.
 - Windows will download and install any pending Windows 10 updates.

 
Mouse-clicking issues in Windows 10 are pretty common. Ensure you are running the latest stable Windows 10 build to fix any problems caused by a glitch in the OS.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

### 4. Check your mouse and third-party software
 
#### 4.1 Try another mouse or your mouse on another computer
 
Disconnect your mouse from the current machine and connect it to another computer to see if it works properly. 
 
If it does, it means that the problem is from the original computer. Check the port in which is connected or try connecting it to another port.
 
You may also try to unplug the mouse and connect another mouse to your computer. Right-click on any app or desktop and check if the secondary mouse is working.
 
If the mouse works, you may need to replace the device with a new one.
 
#### 4.2 Check for a third-party software
 
- If you had recently installed third-party software to customize a mouse or keyboard, it might create issues with the pointing device.
 - Close any apps such as Razer Synapse or other customization software from the Task Manager.
 - Disconnect and reconnect the mouse to see if that resolves the issue.

 
### 5. Use a restore point
 
- Press the Windows key, type restore, select Create a restore point, and hit Enter to open System Properties.
 - Press the Tab key to select the System Restore button and hit Enter.
 - Hit Enter to select the Next option.
 - Use the Tab key to select a restore point, navigate to Next with the Tab key, and hit Enter.
 - Windows will restore your system to its state before the date selected. However, the process may take some time to complete, so wait till the PC reboots and shows a success message.

 
Repeat the steps with an older Restore Point if System Restore is unsuccessful.
