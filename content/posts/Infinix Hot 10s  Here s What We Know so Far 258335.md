If you thought you knew everything about the latest smartphones, think again! It's time to buckle up for some astonishing news, as the Infinix Hot 10S leaks are in, and they reveal some insane features that will blow your mind.

In case you haven't heard, Infinix Mobility – the Hong Kong-based smartphone manufacturer – has been making waves in the tech community for providing affordable yet high-quality smartphones. After the successful launch of the Hot 10 and Hot 10 Play, the Hot 10S is the next big thing to watch out for.

So, what are the new features that we can expect from the Hot 10S? Well, we're here to spill some tea.

First things first, the Infinix Hot 10S comes with a massive 6.82-inch HD+ display, which makes it great for those who enjoy streaming movies or playing games on their smartphones. Additionally, you'll get a smooth scrolling experience thanks to the High Refresh Rate (90Hz) feature, which eliminates screen lags and stuttering.

But wait, there's more. The Hot 10S comes with a powerful MediaTek Helio G85 processor, which provides top-notch performance while using less power. That means you can run multiple apps simultaneously without worrying about your battery draining out too quickly.

Now, let's talk about the camera. The Infinix Hot 10S features a 48MP AI-powered triple camera system, which means you can take clear and detailed pictures even in low-light conditions. Plus, you'll get a 2MP depth sensor for portrait shots, and an AI lens to capture the world in different perspectives.

The Hot 10S also comes with a mammoth 6000mAh battery, which should last you for an entire day of usage. And if you're a heavy user, the 18W fast charging will juice up your battery in no time.

But here's the real shocker - the Infinix Hot 10S comes with a special feature called the Dar-link Ultimate Game Booster. This feature is designed to enhance the smartphone's gaming performance by optimizing graphics, sound, and network connectivity. Plus, it also reduces heating issues, making the Hot 10S an excellent option for gamers on a budget.

With all these exciting features, the Infinix Hot 10S is sure to be a game-changer in the smartphone industry. And the best part? It won't break the bank. So, keep your eyes peeled for the official launch and get ready to experience the Infinix Hot 10S in all its glory!

While Infinix has been a household name in this neck of the woods for years now, it is only now starting to venture into the global market as it makes its devices available in more and more markets.
 
Also worth noting is that, Transsion, the company behind the Infinix, Tecno and iTel brands has been seemingly taking it slow when it comes to smartphone launches in the past couple of months. 
 
Last year, we saw the release of the Infinix Hot 10 and the Infinix Hot 10 Lite. That was followed by the release of the Infinix Hot 10 Play earlier this year.
 
That said, Infinix is reportedly gearing up for the launch of its budget gaming device in form of the Infinix Hot 10S. This device is set to strike the same price-point as devices in the Hot series.
 
So what does this device bring to the table? Here’s a summary of the device’s spec sheet:
 
- Processor: Mediatek Helio G85Storage: 4GB+128GB or 6GB+128GB in other marketsBattery: 5000 mAh or 6000 mAh depending on regionDisplay: 6.82-inch HD+ panel with 90Hz refresh rateSoftware: Android 11-based XOS 7.6Cameras: 48MP main, AI Camera, 2MP depth sensor and 8MP front-facing camera.

 
As mentioned, the Infinix Hot 10S is a budget gaming device and as such, is powered by the Helio G85, a mid-range gaming chip from Mediatek. For a decent gaming experience, you also need a good display. 
 
The Hot 10S packs a 6.82-inch HD+ panel with a teardrop cutout for the selfie shooter. This panel has a 90Hz refresh-rate, a first for the Hot series of devices.
 
Staying true to Infinix’s trend of fitting the biggest possible battery cell on their devices, the Hot 10S comes with a 6,000mAh battery cell. However, there is an NFC model that comes with a 5,000mAh cell instead. These cells will juice up at 10W via a micro-USB port.
 
Speaking of NFC, some markets will have this feature; that will enable things like contactless payments in supported markets along with features such as Android Beam. From what we know so far, the NFC variant of the Infinix Hot 10S will retail in Indonesia, Russia, and Latin America.
 
That NFC model will also skim off a little on the RAM as reports indicate that the NFC variant will spot 4GB instead of 6GB on the non-NFC models.
 
## Pricing and Availability of Infinix Hot 10S
 
Seeing as the Hot 10S is part of the Infinix Hot 10 family that currently boasts of Infinix Hot 10, Hot 10 Lite, and Hot 10 Play, we expect a similar price-point. Reports indicate that the Hot 10S should be priced between $120-$130 depending on the variant.
 
The device will be available in 4 colors, interestingly named: 95° Black, Morandi Green, Heart of the Ocean, and 7° Purple. We still have no word on local availability but we shall be on hand to update as and when we learn new info on the same so stay tuned.
