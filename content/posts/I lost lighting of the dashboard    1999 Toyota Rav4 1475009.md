As a long-time owner of a 1999 Toyota Rav4, I could say that I knew every inch of my car like the back of my hand. Even after more than two decades, I still enjoyed driving it around town, feeling the wind on my face, and singing along to my favorite tunes.

However, one unexpected thing had me feeling perplexed and somewhat frustrated. The lighting in my dashboard went out, rendering me unable to see my speedometer or my fuel gauge at night. I was caught off guard, and my initial reaction was one of panic - how was I going to drive safely without knowing my speed, especially at night?

I hit the road gingerly, afraid of being pulled over by the police for driving below the speed limit, and perhaps getting a citation. I felt like I was driving blind, aware only of the sounds of the engine and the feeling of the wind on my face.

Gradually, something strange happened - I began to enjoy driving my vehicle more. I started to rely less on the instruments in front of me and more on my intuition. My sense of speed began to sharpen, and I could tell if I was going too fast or too slow just from the way the car felt.

At night, my surroundings changed into something from a dream. The lights on the road seemed brighter, the stars in the sky shone more clearly, and the breeze that came through the window was fresher. There were no distractions from the dashboard lights to take away from the experience.

The music that played in the car seemed more enjoyable than ever before. I was no longer distracted from the tunes by what was happening around me. I could focus on the joy of singing along with the music and driving confidently.

But the real test of my driving experience came when I was alone on the road. It was as if I was in a driving meditation. I felt like I was connecting with the car at a deeper level than before. I could hear every shift of the gears, feel the way the car hugged the road, and experience a sense of peace that came from knowing that I was in control of my vehicle.

This experience changed my perception of driving. It wasn't just a way to get from point A to point B, but it had become an activity that I enjoyed and found therapeutic. Losing the lighting in my dashboard gave me a new appreciation for driving and how it can be a truly holistic experience.

So the next time you find yourself in a similar situation, don't panic. Embrace the change, and enjoy the ride. Sometimes it's the unexpected things that teach us the best lessons.

## Chosen Solution
 For a 1999 Toyota Rav4; I checked every single fuse and none shows any defect. What fuse that should be responsible for dashboard lighting?
Any other reason may result in such a defect?
Update (07/10/2017)
You're referring to this  fuse box location. Yes I did check and tested that specific fuse and every sing one. All functional.
Note that the pic is for a 1998 model but it has same location. Not necessary same fuses locations though.

 Have you checked the INSIDE (left of steering wheel) fuses?
Second from top on far left is labeled "GAUGE". It's a 10 amp.

 My 07 rav4 ft did the same things kept loosing power i don't know what to do.  Any help please
