You'll Never Believe How Changing Your Samsung Galaxy S5 Signal Search to 3G Can Transform Your Mobile Experience!

If you have a Samsung Galaxy S5, you know how frustrating it can be when your mobile signal drops, especially if you're streaming videos, browsing the web, or downloading large files. The good news is that you can improve your mobile signal and experience by changing your signal search to 3G. Yes, 3G!

Many people assume that 4G is the only way to get fast mobile data speeds, but this is not always the case. While 4G is faster than 3G, it also requires a stronger signal and more battery power. In areas where 4G signals are weak or unstable, your phone will take longer to connect and drain your battery faster. However, if your phone is set to search for 3G, you can improve your mobile experience in several ways.

Firstly, switching to 3G can extend your battery life. This is because 3G requires less power than 4G, so your phone won't need to work as hard to maintain a signal. This can make a big difference in areas where 4G signals are weak or non-existent, such as rural areas or underground buildings. By reducing the strain on your battery, you can use your phone for longer and enjoy a more reliable connection.

Secondly, switching to 3G can improve your data speeds in areas with weak 4G signals. While 3G speeds may not be as fast as 4G, they are still sufficient for most mobile tasks, such as browsing, downloading, and streaming. In fact, in some cases, your phone may be able to get a stronger and faster 3G signal than 4G, especially if you're in an area with many buildings or trees that can block 4G signals. By using 3G instead of 4G in these situations, you can avoid frustration and improve your mobile experience.

Thirdly, switching to 3G can reduce your data costs. This is because 3G plans are often cheaper than 4G plans, especially if you don't use much data or need the extra speed. By using 3G instead of 4G, you can save money on your monthly bill and still enjoy reliable and fast mobile data.

So, how can you change your signal search to 3G on your Samsung Galaxy S5? Follow these steps:

1. Go to your phone's settings
2. Tap on "More Networks" or "Connections"
3. Select "Mobile Networks"
4. Select "Network mode"
5. Choose "3G only" or "WCDMA only" (depending on your carrier)

Note: If you want to switch back to 4G, simply follow the same steps and choose "LTE/WCDMA/GSM (auto connect)" or "4G/LTE/WCDMA/GSM (auto connect)."

In conclusion, switching to 3G on your Samsung Galaxy S5 can transform your mobile experience. By extending your battery life, improving your data speeds, and reducing your data costs, you can enjoy a more reliable and affordable connection. So, next time you're struggling with a weak or unstable signal, give 3G a try and see the difference for yourself!

## Chosen Solution
 I live in a very remote location and rely on a Wilson signal booster for cell use. I get 4G with the booster and occaisionally 3G without it. 4G is very slow and almost useless for most things, especially video and sending photos. 3G does everything well. I can watch Youtube wthout interruption and pictures send in a reasonable amount of time.
Is there a way to program the phone so it doesn't seek 4G and 5G? All I want is 3G.
Thanks

 Hi @jekyll ,
Select GSM only and check if that resolves the problem
In Settings > More Networks > Mobile Networks > Network mode >GSM only.
