But, many users have reported that the customer service representatives of iRobot have suggested a temporary solution, which is to reset the Roomba and reposition it on the charging base. However, the temporary solution has not helped all the users.

## Chosen Solution
 My Roomba 960 give the “Charging Error 6” error, according to Roomba that means battery overheated but this happens even with a refurbished battery right out of the box. Any ideas? I'm not above taking it apart but I was hoping for a little direction.

 Does it have warranty? If not then I think the battery sensor is faulty. It must taken apart to change the sensor and see if that’s the issue. Maybe changing the battery will fix it.
Hope this helps, let us know!
