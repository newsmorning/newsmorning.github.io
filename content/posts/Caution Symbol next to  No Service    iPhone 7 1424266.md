If you are an iPhone 7 user and have noticed a caution symbol next to the "No Service" message in the top left corner of your screen, you may be wondering what it means. This symbol is not to be taken lightly as it could indicate a serious issue with your device's cellular connectivity.

The caution symbol appears when your iPhone 7 is unable to establish reliable communication with your cellular provider's network. There are several reasons why this may be happening, including software glitches, network outages, or hardware malfunctions.

One common cause of the caution symbol is a damaged SIM card. Your SIM card is the small, rectangular piece of hardware that contains your phone number and allows your device to connect to your cellular provider's network.

To fix this issue, you may need to replace your SIM card with a new one. You can get a replacement from your network provider or purchase one at an electronics store. Once you have inserted the new SIM card into your iPhone 7, the caution symbol should disappear, and your device should be able to connect to your network properly.

Another potential cause of the caution symbol is a software glitch. Your iPhone's software may be outdated, or there may be a bug that is preventing your device from connecting to your cellular network. To fix this issue, you can try updating your device's software to the latest version.

To update your iPhone 7's software, go to Settings > General > Software Update. If there is an update available, your device will download and install it automatically. Once the update is complete, your phone should connect to your network correctly, and the caution symbol should disappear.

If neither of these solutions works, the issue may be with your device's hardware. In this case, you will need to bring your iPhone 7 to a certified repair center for assessment and repair. Attempting to fix hardware problems on your own can result in further damage to your device, so it's best to seek professional help.

In conclusion, if you see a caution symbol next to the "No Service" message on your iPhone 7, don't ignore it. It could indicate a serious issue with your device's cellular connectivity, and it's important to address the problem as soon as possible. Try replacing your SIM card, updating your software, and if those don't work, seek professional help from a certified repair center.

## Chosen Solution
 I had a friend look at a phone that was stuck in a boot loop. The boot loop lasted for about 5 months? After he fixed it (he said all he did was mess with iTunes until it finally started), there was a Caution triangle to the left of the “No Service” in the left. I figured if I restored the phone, it would all be peachy. Nope. Now the phone is stuck on the “Hello” screen because soon after it goes “Unable to Activate": An update is required to activate your iPhone.” No idea where to go from here. Do I keep restoring until I catch a lucky break?

 No service  will most likely be baseband issues.
I had a similar situation with a 7 that had shorted  baseband CPU.
Causing phone to have no reception.
This will also cause the phone not to restore correctly.
Your phone will need board level work to be repaired and suggest looking for a micro solderer.

 The antenna may have become dislodged.
While sitting down, turn your phone screen facing down in a horizontal position across your upper leg.
Firmly rock it left-to-right across your upper leg for about 5-10 secs. (Be careful not to do it so hard that you bend your phone).
Switch your phone to Flight Mode and back again to reinitialise the network search.
Repeat if necessary.
This should re-seat the antenna and restore network connectivity.
I had exhausted all other software options, and this is the only thing that actually worked for me! I've been doing this for a few weeks now and it consistently restores service to my iPhone 6. I still lose network every few days (sometimes multiple times in a single day), but this method restores it every time.
Best of luck.

 That is Baseband related issues.That is mostly shown in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus too.That is Cronic problem in that series.Apple have to look for that issues.Million of iPhone 7 and 7 plus going to die day by day.
