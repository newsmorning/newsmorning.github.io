Is Your Acer Aspire E1 571 Dead? Discover the Surprising Fix for a Boot-Up Failure!

Are you struggling to turn on your Acer Aspire E1 571 laptop? Does it seem like your device has died and won't revive? Well, before you think about dropping a hefty sum of money on getting a new system, there's a potential fix you might want to try.

Acer Aspire E1 571 is a decent performing laptop, but like any electronic device, it faces some issues. One of the most common ones is the boot-up problem, which could be a result of power supply, battery, or even the system's firmware.

So, before you panic, try these solutions to get your Acer Aspire E1 571 running again:

Solution #1: Check the Power Supply

One of the common reasons for a boot-up failure is inadequate power supply. Therefore, the first thing you should do is check whether the power cord is plugged into the socket correctly or not. You can also check for any worn-out or damaged cable.

If the cable looks fine, then try another power outlet to see if it's drawing power. Then, inspect the charger and battery indicator LEDs, making sure both are fully active.

Solution #2: Reboot the Battery

Your laptop's inability to turn on could also be due to a dead battery. However, it's more likely to happen when the battery fails to reset properly.

To reboot the battery, complete the following steps:

1. Power off your laptop.

2. Disconnect your laptop from the power supply source.

3. Flip your laptop upside down and release the battery.

4. Hold down the power button for 30 seconds.

5. Reinsert the battery and turn on the laptop.

If the battery is functional, this should get it working again. However, if it's old or damaged, you may need a battery replacement.

Solution #3: Reset the Firmware

The firmware is responsible for controlling the laptop's hardware and is stored on your laptop's motherboard. This can occasionally fail, causing your laptop to freeze or not boot up.

To reset the firmware, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Disconnect the laptop from the power supply source.

2. Remove the battery.

3. Press and hold the power button for 30 seconds.

4. Reinsert the battery and connect the power supply source.

5. Turn on the laptop.

If the firmware is the problem, resetting it should do the trick. However, if the issue persists, it may be a sign of a more serious problem.

Conclusion

The Acer Aspire E1 571 is an excellent laptop, but it can experience problems with a boot-up failure. However, the good news is that it's not a death-knell, and there are simple and effective ways to revive your system. These three solutions should help you get your laptop back up and running in no time. If you're still having issues, it might be worth contacting a professional service provider for further assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 My acer won't go past acer start up screen tried pressing alt+f10 for safe mode but nothing happens. If I get a new hard drive and buy Windows 8 to reinstall Windows will I need original licence. Looked all over laptop and box it came in and can't find licence key. What can I do.

 I think windows 8 is good for like 30 days before needing a key...
