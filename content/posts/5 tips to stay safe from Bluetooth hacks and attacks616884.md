Is Your Bluetooth Device Secretly Being Hacked? Protect Yourself with These 5 Life-Saving Tips!

Bluetooth technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, allowing us to connect our phones, laptops, and other devices to speakers, headphones, and even our cars. As convenient as Bluetooth is, it has also become an easy target for hackers, who can use it to access our personal information and even take control of our devices. So, is your Bluetooth device secretly being hacked? In this article, we’ll discuss five life-saving tips to help you protect yourself.

1. Keep Your Device Updated

One of the best ways to protect yourself from Bluetooth hacking is by keeping your device updated. Developers often release updates to patch security vulnerabilities that have been discovered. Keep a close eye on the software updates for your device, and always install them as soon as possible. Latest updates also contain enhanced security measures that will help you stay safe from potential threats.

2. Turn Off Your Bluetooth When Not in Use

Leaving your Bluetooth on when you’re not using it can make it vulnerable to hacking. Always make sure to turn off your Bluetooth when you’re not using it. This will prevent unauthorized access to your device and protect your personal information.

3. Use Strong Passwords

Using strong passwords is always a good idea, no matter what devices you’re using. Make sure that your Bluetooth device has a strong password that is not easily guessable or can easily be cracked. This will ensure that your device stays secure even if someone gains access to your Bluetooth connection.

4. Check the Bluetooth Connection

Always make sure to check the Bluetooth connection on your device to see if there are any unknown devices connected. If you see any unknown devices, disconnect them immediately. This will reduce the possibility of the hackers using those devices to access your device and information.

5. Use a VPN

Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your device can significantly reduce the risk of Bluetooth hacking. A VPN creates a secure tunnel between your device and the internet, keeping your data safe from prying eyes, and decreasing the likelihood of any hacking attempts.

In conclusion, Bluetooth hacking is a real threat, and it is imperative that we take the necessary steps to protect ourselves. By following these five tips, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your devices and information. Always be vigilant and stay safe!

Sending files between devices over Bluetooth today sounds old school. It works over distances. It’s slower compared to newer and more improved technologies like WiFi. That’s how most people think about Bluetooth currently. But did you know that Bluetooth hacks and attacks are real? Below, we offer tips on how you can secure your device and stay safe from Bluetooth hacks and attacks.
 
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows electronic devices to exchange data over short distances. These devices take in smartphones, portable speakers, tablets, PDAs, smart watches, wearable fitness monitors – etcetera. Ever since its invention in 1994 by Dutch electrical engineer Jaap Haartsen, Bluetooth technology has become part of our lives. There are an estimated 8.2 Bluetooth enabled devices in the world today. It’s in our houses, cars, pockets, around our wrists. It’s everywhere!
 
Bluetooth sniffing tools are still inferior when equated to those available for sniffing other forms of wireless connections for instance WiFi. This makes it harder for hackers to develop exploits for Bluetooth devices. However, it also makes it more problematic to realistically evaluate Bluetooth safety from hacks.
 
In 2017, Armis security published details of a Bluetooth vulnerability dubbed Blueborne that could potentially expose millions of devices to remote attack. Blueborne worked by camouflaging as a Bluetooth device and ill-using the weaknesses in the protocol to deploy malicious code. Here are 5 tips to keep you safe from Bluetooth hacks and attacks.
 
## How to stay safe from Bluetooth hacks and attacks
 
- Enable Bluetooth only when required

 
This is important because for hackers can only connect remotely to your device when its Bluetooth is powered on. With Bluetooth on, hackers can see what networks you have previously connected to and spoof them. This tricks your device into connecting to Bluetooth devices of the hackers giving them control. Once in control of your device, hackers can barrage your device with malware, steal data or even spy on you.
 
### Enable Bluetooth only when required
 
- Enable Bluetooth discovery only when necessary, and disable discovery when finished

 
Turning your Bluetooth setting to invisible makes it harder for hackers to discover your device, thus making it more difficult for them to steal your data. It is still possible to connect to your device even when you make it “non-discover-able”, but it is less frequent.
 
### Enable Bluetooth discovery only when necessary, and disable discovery when finished
 
- Do not enter link keys or PINs when unexpectedly prompted to do so

 
This is the equivalent of opening the door wide for the thief to enter your house. Hackers may want to prompt you to let them in. Do not accept pairing requests from unknown devices.
 
### Do not enter link keys or PINs when unexpectedly prompted to do so
 
- Regularly update firmware on Bluetooth-enabled devices

 
Firmware updates entail security patches to hackers’ exploits. Bad guys take time to create exploits that utilize loop holes in the software. Normally, security updates cover those loop holes hence sending the bad guys back to the drawing boards once again. Constantly updating your device’s firmware improves security and consequently prevents chances of falling victim to hacks.
 
### Regularly update firmware on Bluetooth-enabled devices
 
- Use two-factor authentication.

 
Many key internet websites will make available a login option for two-factor authentication. Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Google are examples of such companies that will ask you for a secret code that is sent through text message to your cellphone. This is a great form of protection because even if the hacker succeeds in stealing password information from your device using Bluetooth hacks and attacks, it would be impossible to login without having full access to your phone.
