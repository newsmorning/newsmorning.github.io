Have you ever settled down to watch your favorite show or movie only to be greeted by annoying static lines or discover that your LG TV is taking ages to start up? Do you sometimes get a green screen or experience other weird TV issues? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then your LG TV might be haunted!

But don't worry; you don't have to call in the Ghostbusters to banish those spooky TV demons. Instead, you can follow these simple tips to get your LG TV working correctly again.

Banish Horizontal Static Lines

Horizontal static lines are a common issue experienced by LG TV users. Often, this problem is caused by poor cable connections or problems with the antenna. Here are some steps you can take to eliminate those annoying lines once and for all:

1. Check the cable connections: Ensure that all cables connecting to your TV, such as the HDMI, AV, and coaxial cables, are correctly plugged in.

2. Adjust the antenna: If you're using an antenna, ensure that it's pointing in the right direction and is positioned correctly.

3. Check network connectivity: If you're streaming content, check your network connectivity. Poor network signals can lead to horizontal static lines.

Slow TV Startup

If your LG TV takes ages to start up, it can be frustrating, especially if you're in a hurry. Here are some things you can do to speed up your TV's startup process:

1. Unplug the TV: Sometimes, a simple power reset can help speed up the TV's startup process. Unplug your TV from the power source and wait a full minute before plugging it back in.

2. Enable quick-start feature: Some LG TVs have a Quick Start feature that enables them to boot up faster. Check your TV's settings and enable this feature if it's available.

3. Check for software updates: If your TV's firmware is outdated, it can slow down the boot-up process. Check for software updates and install the latest version to optimize your TV's performance.

Green Screen Issues

If you're experiencing an occasional green screen on your LG TV, it's time to take some action. Here are some things you can do to fix this issue:

1. Check cable connections: Check all cable connections and ensure that they are secure and correctly plugged in.

2. Adjust color settings: Sometimes, color settings on your TV can cause green screen issues. Access the TV's color settings and ensure that RGB or YCbCr is selected.

3. Clear TV memory: Clearing your TV's memory may help eliminate any temporary issues that might be causing the green screen problem. To do this, go to your TV's settings, select the General tab, and then select Reset to Initial Settings.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're experiencing any of these issues, don't panic or assume that your LG TV is haunted. Instead, take a deep breath and try out these simple tips to banish those spooky TV demons for good. You can now sit back, relax, and enjoy your favorite shows without any interruption. Happy viewing!

## Chosen Solution
 On my LG LCD TV # 42LG60   2or3 on/off tries to get it to startup and when it does, it has jumpy horizontal lines.  Like static lines.  Once in a while it it might startup with a blank green screen,  Everything else seems to work fine.  I pulled the back off and cleaned all the cable connections, but nothing  changed.
Have you got any suggestions on witch board might cause this problem  ?

 @davidj_daniel horizontal lines like you describe are most commonly caused by a bad LCD driver board. That board is part of your screen and cannot be replaced. Post some good pictures of what your screen shows as well as what your boards look like etc. that way we can see what you see and we may identify some other issues.
