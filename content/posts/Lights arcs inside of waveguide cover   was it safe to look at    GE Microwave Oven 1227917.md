Title: "Uncovering the Truth about Mysterious Arcs of Light in Your GE Microwave Oven: Is it Safe?"

Introduction:

Microwave ovens have become a staple in our kitchens. They offer quick and convenient cooking or heating options that save us time and effort. But have you ever looked inside your microwave oven during operation and noticed some mysterious arcs of light lurking in your waveguide cover? What are they, and should we be concerned about their safety? This article aims to explore the truth behind the arcs of light seen inside GE microwave ovens and whether they pose any health risks.

What is a Waveguide Cover?

The waveguide cover is a metal component found inside your microwave oven. Its purpose is to shield the microwave energy that travels from the magnetron tube to the cooking chamber. It ensures that the microwaves are directed properly, and that no leakage occur. The waveguide cover also protects the magnetron tube from food debris, which can damage it.

What are the Mysterious Arcs of Light?

The arcs of light seen inside the waveguide cover are electrical sparks that travel between the metal surfaces. They can happen when microwaves bounce off the metal surfaces and create electrical charges that result in arcing. The arcs can be quite dangerous, as they can start fires, damage the magnetron tube, and result in electrical shocks. Therefore, it is important to understand the causes behind these arcs and how to prevent them.

Why do Arcs of Light Occur in GE Microwave Ovens?

Arcs of light can occur due to a few reasons. One of the common causes is the accumulation of food debris, grease, and other residues in the waveguide cover. These residues can absorb microwave energy and create hot spots that lead to arcing. Another cause is the deterioration of the waveguide cover due to wear and tear. Over time, the cover can become damaged, rusted, or cracked, which can cause arcing. Lastly, the use of the wrong type of cookware, such as metal or aluminum, can also cause arcing and damage to the waveguide cover.

How to Prevent Arcs of Light in GE Microwave Ovens?

The first step to prevent arcs of light in your GE microwave oven is to clean the waveguide cover regularly. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe the cover clean after each use. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the cover. If you notice any damage, rust, or cracking, immediately replace the waveguide cover with a new one. Secondly, always use microwave-safe cookware that is not made of metal, aluminum, or any other conductive material to prevent arcing. Lastly, if you observe any unusual sparks or electrical noise coming from your microwave oven, switch it off immediately, unplug it, and consult a professional technician to inspect it.

Conclusion:

Microwave cooking has become a norm in our daily lives, and understanding the safety concerns associated with it is important. The arcs of light seen inside the waveguide cover of GE microwave ovens can be alarming and even dangerous. Taking preventative measures such as regular cleaning, using microwave-safe cookware, and immediately addressing any issues can ensure safe use of your microwave oven. By following these simple steps, you can continue to enjoy the convenience and benefits of microwave cooking without any harmful consequences.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I asked this question on another old thread but was not sure if that question will be seen so I thought I would start my own thread.
First, thank you for all of you who will respond to me. I appreciate it alot.
Okay so here is my question: 
Hi I am having the crackling/arcing/flashing light in the wave guide cover when my microwave runs. The issue just started. I did read previous threads on this issue and know to clean the microwave really good.
What I want to know is this:
Was it dangerous for my eyes to see those flashes of light or "arcs" in the wave guide cover? I was standing back at the sink about 4-6 feet away when it happened and I could see inside and see those flashes. I have an eye disease so I get concerned and have anxiety about eye damage. I hope it was safe for my eyes to see those arcs? I mean, I heard the crackling noise and looked towards the inside of the microwave and saw those flashes (or arcs) at the wave guide location and then turned it off. I sure hope this was not dangerous for my eyes to see. Its not like a welders arc, correct?
Thank you so much
Any answers from experts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.

 @shk37 “Its not like a welders arc, correct “ that is correct. That is actually a conjunctivitis caused by the UV rays during the arc welding.  In your case there are A. no UV radiation in the Microwave and B. Even if there were,  the glass in the door would protect you from it as well as the distance you had between this. It is never a good idea to look directly into arc’s and sparks like that but in your case I am certain you are pretty safe. If in doubt, you can follow up with your ophthalmologist or utilize Tele-Health for it.
