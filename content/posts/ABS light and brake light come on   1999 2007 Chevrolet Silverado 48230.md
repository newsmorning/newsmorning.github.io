You Won't Believe Why The ABS and Brake Lights Are Coming On In Your Chevrolet Silverado - Find Out Now!

As a Chevrolet Silverado owner, seeing those dreaded ABS and brake lights come on can be quite worrisome. Rest assured, this isn't an uncommon issue, and there are a few reasons as to why it may be happening. From minor malfunctions to serious safety concerns, it's important to identify the root of the problem as soon as possible. In this article, we'll go over the primary reasons why you're experiencing this issue, and what you can do about it.

1. Low Brake Fluid

One of the most common reasons why the ABS and brake lights may be coming on in your Chevy Silverado is due to low brake fluid levels. It's important to regularly check your brake fluid levels and refill them before they become too low. If your brake fluid levels are low, it could indicate a potential leak in your brake system that needs to be immediately fixed. A brake system leak can compromise your ability to stop the vehicle, which can lead to serious accidents.

2. Worn Brake Pads

If your brake pads are worn, it can also trigger the ABS and brake lights to come on. Typically, brake pads need to be replaced every 50,000 miles, depending on your driving habits. If you're experiencing a significant reduction in brake performance or hearing grinding noises when braking, it's likely that your brake pads need to be replaced. Ignoring this issue can not only trigger your warning lights but can also result in costly repairs in the future.

3. Malfunctioning ABS Sensor

The ABS and brake lights can also be triggered if the ABS sensor is malfunctioning. The ABS sensor detects wheel speed fluctuations and sends that information to the ABS control module. In turn, the ABS control module adjusts brake pressure to prevent the wheels from locking up. If the ABS sensor is damaged, it can't effectively communicate with the ABS control module, which can trigger the warning lights.

4. Faulty ABS Control Module

In some instances, your ABS and brake lights may be illuminated due to a faulty ABS control module. This is especially true if you've recently had an accident or experienced a significant jolt to the vehicle. A faulty ABS control module can cause the brakes to malfunction, which can put you and your passengers in danger. If you suspect your ABS control module is faulty, it's crucial to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic immediately.

In Conclusion

The ABS and brake lights coming on in your Chevrolet Silverado can be caused by a range of issues. From low brake fluid to a malfunctioning ABS control module, it's essential to identify the issue as soon as possible. If ignored, these warning lights can lead to costly repairs and, in some cases, put you in danger on the road. If you're experiencing this issue, it's vital to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic for a proper diagnosis and repair. Don't wait until it's too late - your safety could depend on it.

## Chosen Solution
 After driving a few miles my ABS light and brake light come on and stay on. Sometimes it’s immediatley sometimes it’s after awhile. Tried to get the code read but doesn’t come on when the truck isn’t on. Not sure if ABS module or just a sensor. Don’t want to replace the module and that not be it.

 Did you try to get an OBD2 reader to get the code when your car is running? If not, than it’s pointless. If yes, than go to service and ask them to check ABS and brake system, for everyone’s sake and safety.
