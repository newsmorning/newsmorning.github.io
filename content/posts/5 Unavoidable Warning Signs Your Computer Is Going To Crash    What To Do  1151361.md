When Your Computer Does These 5 Things, It's Screaming for Help! Here's How to Save It!

It's frustrating, isn't it? You're sitting at your computer, trying to get some work done, and it's acting up. Maybe it's slow, or perhaps it's making strange noises. Whatever the symptom, it's clear that your computer is crying out for help. But where do you start? Before you panic and start looking for a new computer, consider these five signs that your computer needs attention, and how to fix them.

1. It's slow.

If your computer is taking forever to do simple tasks like opening a document or webpage, it might be time for some maintenance. Start by cleaning up any unnecessary files or programs. You can use the built-in disk cleaner to get rid of temporary files, or use a third-party app like CCleaner. You may also need more RAM or a faster processor. Contact a computer professional for advice on upgrading your hardware.

2. It's making strange noises.

If your computer is making strange noises, such as clicking, whirring, or grinding, it's likely a hardware issue. These noises could be caused by a failing hard drive, a power supply problem, or a malfunctioning fan. You'll need to take your computer to a professional for diagnosis and repair.

3. It's overheating.

If your computer is getting overly hot, it could be due to a buildup of dust or other debris in the vents and fans. First, turn your computer off and unplug it from the power source. Then, use a can of compressed air to blow out any dust or debris that may have accumulated. If this doesn't solve the problem, you may need to replace the fan or heat sink.

4. It's crashing or freezing.

Random crashes and freezes can be a sign of a software or hardware problem. Start by running a virus scan to rule out malware as the cause. If that doesn't help, try updating your drivers and software. If the problem persists, take your computer to a professional for further diagnosis.

5. It's giving you error messages.

If your computer is giving you error messages, it could mean that something is corrupted or missing in your system. Try running a disk check to identify and repair any errors. If the problem persists, you may need to reinstall your operating system.

In conclusion, when your computer is exhibiting any of these five signs, it's time to take action. Don't panic and rush out to buy a new computer. Instead, try some of the above solutions to save your system. And if all else fails, consider taking your computer to a professional for diagnosis and repair. A little TLC can go a long way in keeping your computer running smoothly.

It is an annoying situation when your computer crashes and brings a halt to the workspace. But the major disturbing cause is accidental data loss thanks to unexpected crashes and freezes. Think about the documents, files, pictures, videos, movies and much more which can just get lost in the blink of an eye.
 
It is thus better to be precautious and learn the warning signs before the computer actually stops working without warning. If you do not want the precious saved files to swish away, keep an eye on the signs and check their solution below.
 

 
### Warning 1: Poor Software Performance
 
If someone tells you that your laptop or computer keeps freezing because the hardware is not performing well, he may be only partially correct. Sometimes the software is not able to run due to low processing power of the computer.
 
What Can I Do?
 
You have two options here! Get your disk space enlarged with better RAM or avoid opening multiple applications on your PC at the same time. In such cases it is better to get your disk space analyzed.
 
### Warning 2: Poor Hardware Performance
 
If your system has been running with crawling speed for some time, be sure that it will be crash sooner. There are several other causes within the computer including a noisy system fan or hard drive. Do not ignore if these components are making a weird sound for a long time. Along with that, make sure that your PC is not heating up again and again. If these signs have prolonged, it is a potent warning sign.
 
Many monitoring tools are present online to check the temperature of your CPU & GPU to prevent overheating. Install any one of them and get the details now.
 
Moreover, if you are confident enough, open up the system and clean the dirt cautiously using canned compressed air.
 
### Warning 3: Boot Errors
 
You may say that constant boot errors are very common in the system process but remember that an increasing number of errors is taking your system towards crashing. ‘Boot device not found’ or ‘Unable to Boot Error 0xc00000e9’ are such errors that you may notice that shall not be sidelined.
 
Repair your computer after inserting a flash drive in PC and rebooting it. If the case doesn’t work well, be prepared to reinstall the operating system.
 
Before reinstalling, don’t forget to take Systweak Right Backup for Windows as well as Mac. You can retrieve all your documents and files from the software and enjoy the experience seamlessly.
 
### Warning 4: File Corruption
 
There might be some apps in your PC that constantly give File & Program corruption errors. Or they do not work regularly with smoothness. Reasons for such error could range from malware, corrupt drive, issues in internal components and more.
 
Keeping an anti-malware is already a must before anything else runs on your computer. From McAfee to Avast, you have a range of anti-malware to escape from virus attack. If you are a Mac user, Systweak Anti-Malware is the right tool.
 
Along with this, do not forget to open the desired app in the appropriate software so as to avoid unnecessary errors.
 
### Warning 5: Conflict Between Hardware
 
In this case, two software might be using one hardware component at the same time causing a conflict. This problem may occur with one app but not in another, and here comes another cause of computer freezing. The app may crash at last bringing the situation to an end with ‘Blue Screen of Death’. We are sure you do not want that!
 
Open Device manager app on your Windows PC or System Information in Mac and analyze if any warning or yellow exclamation mark has been denoted. If you find any application creating baffles within, reinstall after deleting them.
 
### What If The Computer Crashes?
 
If all the warning signs have been avoided lately and the computer has crashed within no time, we believe that your data might have vanished! But do not panic as you can recover the lost data with third-party software.
 
Systweak also offers an option for Windows in the name of Advanced Disk Recovery. This software deeply scans and recovers all types of files without any hassle.
 
Keep your computer away from crashing with these warning signs and update PC with better software in advance. It would be great to stay cautious not just before your computer freezes but even post the same. Keep checking the errors and eye any other serious threat, if any.
