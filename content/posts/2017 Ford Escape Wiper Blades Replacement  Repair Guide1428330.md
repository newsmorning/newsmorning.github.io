Are Your Wiper Blades Struggling to Survive? Discover the Ultimate Repair Guide for Your 2017 Ford Escape!

As inclement weather approaches, there's nothing more frustrating than having to deal with malfunctioning wipers on your vehicle. With the harsh winter seasons just around the corner, it's imperative to have your windshield wipers functioning at their best capacity. In this article, we'll provide an ultimate guide on how to repair and maintain the windshield wipers on your 2017 Ford Escape.

First, it's essential to understand the types of wipers available for your Ford Escape. The two main types include the traditional frame-style wipers and the newer bracketless wipers. Frame-style wipers have a metal frame that holds the wiper blade in place, while bracketless wipers use a sturdy connection point that's more aerodynamic and less susceptible to clogging.

Once you've identified the type of wiper on your 2017 Ford Escape, you can begin to diagnose what issues it's facing. The most common problems associated with wiper blades include streaking, chattering, and squeaking while wiping. These issues are usually caused by worn-out or damaged wiper blades or buildup of grime and dirt on the windshield.

To tackle this issue, you need to inspect the wiper blades for any signs of damage such as fraying or tears. If any are present, it's essential to replace the wiper blades to prevent further damage. In addition, make sure to clean the windshield regularly to remove any buildup of debris that can damage the wipers.

For traditional frame-style wipers, you must check the metal frame for any signs of damage or rust. If any are present, it's best to replace the wipers. For bracketless wipers, check the connection points, and make sure they're tightly secured. Loose connections can cause the wiper to malfunction and need replacing.

It's also crucial to ensure that the windshield wiper fluid is level and in good condition. Low fluid levels can cause damage to the wipers, while using low-quality windshield wiper fluids can lead to clogging of the spray nozzles.

In conclusion, taking care of your 2017 Ford Escape's windshield wipers can significantly increase their lifespan and performance. Regular inspection, cleaning, and replacement of worn-out wiper blades can help prevent issues such as streaking, chattering, and squeaking. Remember to check the type of wiper on your Ford Escape and maintain it accordingly. Taking these steps will help ensure that your wipers are ready to take on the harsh winter weather.

Step 1

                  Wiper Blades               


 
- 
 - Starting with the driver's side wiper blade, gently lift the wiper blade until it is in an upright position and locked into place.
 - 
 - The wiper blade should be able to stand on its own without any support.

Step 2


 
- 
 - Look for a clip/tab on the top of the wiper blade. Push the tab until it slides out of the metal arm and then the wiper blade should come right out of the metal arm.
 - 
 - Be careful so as to not bend the arm.

Step 3


 
- 
 - Unpackage a new wiper blade. (Please ensure that you purchase the correct type of wiper blades. The wiper blade brand that I have chosen for this guide is the Rain-X Latitude Wiper.)
 - 
 - After several tries and fails, I've determined the Rain-X Latitude wiper blade to be the best fit. Other brands do not come with an adapter.

Step 4


 
- 
 - The 2017 Ford Escape has a PTB (Push Tab Button) arm. The Latitude wipers come with a pre-attached adapter as well as another one in the package. Remove the pre-attached adapter.
 - 
 - This requires quite a bit of effort.
 - 
 - Refrain from using a screwdriver to pry the adapter out since you may damage the blade.

Step 6


 
- 
 - The top of the adapter has a tiny black housing. Fit the top of the wiper arm into the housing and align the bottom of the adapter with the tabs on the arm. Press firmly until you hear a click. Finally the wiper blade is installed.
