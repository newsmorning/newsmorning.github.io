# OMG! Your iPhone 6 Plus Home Button Cover Just Fell Off - Here's the Quick Fix Solution You Need to Know!

If you are a proud owner of an iPhone 6 Plus, there is nothing more frustrating than having your home button cover fall off. This can happen for a variety of reasons, from normal wear and tear to accidental damage.

The good news is that there is a quick and easy fix. Here is what you need to know to get your iPhone 6 Plus home button cover back in place in no time.

## What You Will Need

Before you begin, you will need a few basic tools. The good news is that you probably already have most of these items laying around your house.

* Small Phillips head screwdriver
* Pry tool or guitar pick
* Replacement home button cover

## Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you have everything you need, it is time to get started. Follow these simple steps to fix your iPhone 6 Plus home button cover.

Step 1: Turn off your iPhone.

Before you open your iPhone, make sure that it is turned off. This will prevent any accidental damage to your phone while you work.

Step 2: Remove the two screws at the bottom of your iPhone.

Take your small Phillips head screwdriver and remove the two screws located at the bottom of your iPhone. These screws hold the front panel to the back case.

Step 3: Use a pry tool or guitar pick to separate the front panel from the back case.

Insert your pry tool or guitar pick between the front panel and the back case of your iPhone. Gently apply pressure until the two pieces start to separate. Continue to work your way around the edges of your phone until the front panel comes off.

Step 4: Carefully remove the home button cover.

Once you have removed the front panel, you will see the home button cover connected to the logic board by a ribbon cable. Carefully lift the home button cover up and away from the logic board.

Step 5: Replace the home button cover.

Take your replacement home button cover and place it in the same position where the old home button cover was located. Make sure to connect the ribbon cable to the logic board.

Step 6: Reassemble your iPhone.

Carefully place the front panel back onto the back case of your iPhone. Use your small Phillips head screwdriver to reattach the two screws at the bottom of your phone.

Step 7: Turn on your iPhone.

Once you have reassembled your iPhone, turn it back on. Your home button cover should now be securely in place, and your iPhone should be working like new again.

## Final Thoughts

Fixing your iPhone 6 Plus home button cover is a quick and easy process. All you need are a few basic tools and a replacement home button cover. By following these simple steps, you can get your phone back in working order in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 The cover part fell off but the button itself is working perfectly fine. I was wondering if it would be okay to just put a home button protector where the cover part use to be. My only concern is the fact that I don’t want to mess up the chip thingy that was covered by the cover by placing a protector in it.
