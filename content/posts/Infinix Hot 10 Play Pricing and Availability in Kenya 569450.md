The Kenyan smartphone market is a pretty interesting one with players from China keen on disrupting the status quo really bringing their A-game. Today, Xiaomi, Vivo, and even Oppo’s baby sister, Realme are making major inroads into the market.
 
In this whole disruption, the consumer seems to be coming out on top as there is absolutely no shortage of options at any given price range. Today, that scene is getting a little hotter with the introduction of yet another budget offering from Infinix.
 
To recall, we saw the company unveil the Infinix Hot 10 and Hot 10 Lite in Kenya back in October 2020. The Hot 10 Play also debuted in January in Uganda and other countries.
 
Well, it is time for users in Kenya to get the same treatment as the device is now available in the country across the various distribution channels. So what does this econobox have to offer? Well, here’s the spec-sheet.

The headlining feature of the Infinix Hot 10 Play is the 6000mAh battery life. This will definitely be able to last users through a heavy day’s use with little fuss, aided by the power-sipping HD+ display.
 
The Mediatek Helio G35 that runs the show is reportedly faster and more capable in the graphics department.
 
The device runs the Android 11 OS out-of-the-box. The Android OS is based on the XOS 7.0, a skin that has both been praised for being feature-rich. Conversely, it also received a lot of backlash due to the excessive amount of bloatware and ads.
 
This Infinix Hot 10 Play has a stylish design that is no doubt going to appeal to the budding Kenyan youth, especially bearing in mind the retail price.
