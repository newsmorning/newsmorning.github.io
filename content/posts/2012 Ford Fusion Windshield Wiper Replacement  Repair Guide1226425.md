Title: WARNING: Your 2012 Ford Fusion May be at Risk of Dangerous Windshield Wiper Failure â€“ Learn How to Replace Them Now!

Introduction:

Your windshield wipers are an essential safety feature of your car, especially during poor weather conditions. They help you maintain clear visibility while driving and prevent accidents caused by poor visibility. However, if your windshield wipers fail while you're driving, it could be dangerous, especially if you're driving in heavy rain, snow, or hail.

If you own a 2012 Ford Fusion, you need to be aware that your windshield wipers may be at risk of dangerous failure. In this article, we'll discuss the reasons behind the wiper failure, signs that indicate failure, and provide a guide on how to replace them.

Reasons for Windshield Wiper Failure:

There are several reasons why your windshield wipers may fail. Here are a few reasons:

- Worn-out wiper blades: Over time, your wiper blades can become worn out due to normal wear and tear or exposure to sunlight, which can cause them to crack or become brittle.
- Bent wiper arms: If you've been in an accident or hit a curb, your wiper arms may get bent and unable to provide the right pressure needed to clean the windshield properly.
- Corrosion: Corrosion can build up on the wiper arms, causing them to lose their grip on the wiper blades.
- Broken wiper motor: The wiper motor is what controls the movement of the wiper blades. If it's broken, then the wipers won't work at all.

Signs of Windshield Wiper Failure:

Here are some signs that indicate your windshield wipers may be in danger of failure:

- The wipers make a chattering noise when operating.
- The wipers are leaving streaks or smearing water across your windshield.
- The windshield wipers aren't properly cleaning your windshield anymore.
- The wipers don't move at all.

If you notice any of these signs, you should replace your windshield wipers immediately to prevent dangerous failure.

How to Replace Your Windshield Wipers:

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to replace your windshield wipers:

1. Purchase new wiper blades that are compatible with your car's make and model.

2. Lift the wiper arm away from the windshield, so it's perpendicular to the windshield.

3. Locate the clip or latch that holds the wiper blade to the wiper arm. Press the clip or latch and slide the wiper blade off the arm.

4. Align the new wiper blade's hooks with the wiper arm's hook, then slide it into place until you hear it click.

5. Lower the wiper arm back onto the windshield. Repeat the process with the other wiper blade.

Conclusion:

Your 2012 Ford Fusion windshield wipers are crucial for your safety while driving, especially during bad weather conditions. If your windshield wipers are showing signs of wear and tear, then it's time to replace them to prevent dangerous failure. Follow the guide above to replace your windshield wipers and ensure that you have proper visibility during your drives. Don't take your wiper blades for granted; it can be the difference between you and your passengers' safety on the road.
