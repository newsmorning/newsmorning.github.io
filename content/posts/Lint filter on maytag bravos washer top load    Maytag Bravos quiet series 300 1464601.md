# Discover the Shocking Truth: Maytag Bravos Washer's Lint Filter Could Be Putting Your Family's Health at Risk!

Are you concerned about the safety of your family when doing laundry? You might want to pay attention to this - the lint filter in your Maytag Bravos washer could be putting your family's health at risk!

As you probably know, lint is a common byproduct of laundry that collects in the filter of your washer. The filter's job is to trap these tiny fibers before they can clog the plumbing or end up on your clothes. However, recent studies have shown that the lint filter in some models of Maytag Bravos washer may not be doing its job correctly, leading to potential health risks for your family.

According to the American Lung Association, lint from clothes can contain chemicals, allergens, and even bacteria that can be harmful when inhaled. When you do laundry with a broken or inefficient lint filter, these particles can escape and circulate in the air your family breathes. This can lead to respiratory problems, allergies, and even asthma.

Furthermore, if your Maytag Bravos washer's lint filter is not effectively capturing lint, it may be allowing other debris from your laundry - like pet hair or food particles - to enter your septic system or municipal water supply. This can cause clogs, backups, and other problems in your plumbing - not to mention adding unnecessary pollutants to the environment.

To make matters worse, many users don't realize their lint filter is not working correctly until it's too late. Signs of an ineffective lint filter include longer drying times, recurring clogs in your drains, and noticeable lint on your clothes. If you notice any of these symptoms, it's essential to act fast and replace your Maytag Bravos lint filter.

Luckily, replacing your Maytag Bravos washer's lint filter is a straightforward process. You will need to purchase a compatible new filter from the manufacturer and then locate and remove the old filter. Typically, the filter is located near the top of the washer's agitator; consult your user manual or online resources for more specific instructions. In most cases, you can remove the old filter by twisting it counterclockwise and replacing it with a new one by aligning and twisting it clockwise.

It's essential to keep an eye on your washer's lint filter and replace it when necessary. Doing so will keep your family and plumbing healthy while preventing environmental pollution. Remember, a little preventive maintenance can go a long way in preserving your home's safety and health.

In conclusion, if you own a Maytag Bravos washer, take the time to check your lint filter regularly and replace it if necessary. Doing so will ensure your family's safety and health while protecting the environment. Stay vigilant and informed to keep your home safe, healthy, and pollutant-free.

## Chosen Solution
 I bought a floor model maytag bravos without a manual. How do I check lint filter because I have lint all over my clothes. I've used washing machine cleaners in it but it doesn't work.

 Hi,
There is no mention of a lint filter, in the owner manual.
However there is a drain pump filter, part #14 Basket and tub parts diagram mentioned in the parts list, which is there to trap lint from being pumped out to the drain.
I don’t think that it is designed to be removed too often though. It doesn’t seem to be too user friendly trying to replace it as you will need to remove the basket etc to get to the filter. Also it is held in by screws.
Are you using a HE (high efficiency) laundry detergent in the machine?
The washer manufacturer recommends this type as according to what it says in the owner manual it produces the correct amount of suds required by this type of washer. It may be that other types of detergents produce too many suds and this is reflected in the wash as lint (suds not being properly rinsed from clothing). I know with my machine (different type) I use about 1/2 the recommended amount of detergent just to avoid this from happening. The other option was to add an extra rinse cycle in the wash but that is too wasteful of the water
