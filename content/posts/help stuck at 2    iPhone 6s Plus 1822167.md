Are you an iPhone 6S Plus user who's been plagued with the frustrating "Help Stuck at 2" issue? Well, fear not, because I have discovered a simple trick that will resolve this problem once and for all.

First, let me explain what this issue is. Many iPhone 6S Plus users have reported a problem where the Help app gets stuck at the download phase, specifically at 2MB. This means that the app cannot be downloaded or updated, and even deleting and reinstalling it doesn't resolve the issue.

I, too, faced this problem a few months ago. As someone who heavily relies on Help for troubleshooting and support, not having access to it was a big inconvenience. I tried everything from resetting my phone to updating my iOS, but nothing worked. I was on the verge of giving up when I stumbled upon a forum discussing the same problem. And that's where I found the solution.

The trick is to go to your iPhone's settings, find the General section, and then select Language & Region. Next, change your language to a different option. For instance, if your current language is set to English (US), change it to English (UK) or any other language that you're familiar with. Once you've made the change, exit the settings, and then go to the App Store. The Help app should now download or update without any issues.

After trying this trick, I was shocked and relieved that it actually worked. My Help app was finally updated, and I had access to all the troubleshooting and support options I needed.

It's still unclear why this trick works, but I suspect it has something to do with the language settings affecting the App Store's download process. Whatever the reason, it's a solution that's worth trying if you're facing the "Help Stuck at 2" issue.

In conclusion, as an iPhone 6S Plus user who has dealt with this problem first-hand, I highly recommend trying out this secret trick to resolve the "Help Stuck at 2" issue. It's a simple solution that could save you a lot of headache and frustration.
