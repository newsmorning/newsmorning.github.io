Title: You won't believe the ultimate solution to fix your Kenmore 80 Series Washing Machine - find out now!

Introduction:

Are you tired of dealing with a broken or malfunctioning Kenmore 80 Series washing machine? If so, then you are not alone. For years, homeowners have been struggling with various problems related to their washing machines, such as leaks, noisy operation, or non-functional appliances. It can be daunting, especially when you have to keep buying a new machine or continuously paying a repairman to come and fix it.

The good news is that there is an ultimate solution. In this article, we will show you how you can fix your Kenmore 80 Series washing machine without spending too much money or calling in the professionals. So, get ready to take some notes and let's get to it!

1. Identifying the problem

The first thing you need to do is to identify the problem. It can be anything from leaks, strange noises, or machine not starting at all. Whatever the issue is, you need to know first what needs to be fixed before you start doing some repairs.

2. Tools needed

Once you have identified the problem, you need to gather some essential tools to help you in doing the repair. Some of these tools can be a socket wrench, pliers, screwdrivers, multimeter, and wire strippers.

3. Replacing the door switch

If your washing machine won't start or if it stops working in the middle of the wash cycle, the most common cause is the door switch. Replacing a door switch is easy and can be done by following these simple steps:

Step 1: Turn off your washing machine and unplug it from the outlet.

Step 2: Remove the control panel by loosening the screws at the back.

Step 3: Locate the door switch and disconnect the wires attached to it.

Step 4: Remove the old door switch and replace it with a new one.

Step 5: Reconnect the wires and put the control panel back in place.

Step 6: Plug the washing machine back in and try it out.

4. Fixing leaks

If you notice that your Kenmore 80 Series washing machine is leaking, there could be two reasons: a faulty water pump or a clogged drain hose. To fix this problem, follow these steps:

Step 1: Turn off the washing machine and unplug it from the outlet.

Step 2: Locate the water pump at the bottom of the machine.

Step 3: Place a towel under the pump to catch any water that might leak.

Step 4: Disconnect the hoses from the water pump.

Step 5: Remove the pump and inspect it for any damages.

Step 6: If the pump is damaged, replace it with a new one.

Step 7: If the pump is still functioning, check for any clogs in the drain hose.

Step 8: Make sure that the drain hose is properly attached to the pump.

Step 9: Reconnect the hoses and plug the washing machine back in.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, fixing a Kenmore 80 Series washing machine doesn't have to be difficult or expensive. Most of the time, you can solve the problem by identifying what needs to be fixed and following simple steps like replacing the door switch or fixing leaks. By doing this on your own, you can save money and time, and experience the satisfaction of doing something on your own.

However, if after following these steps, you still encounter issues, it's best to seek professional assistance. Don't wait too long and have your troubles compounded. Contact an experienced technician or repairman, and they will have their diagnostics done quickly and reliably.

## Chosen Solution
 I need all part numbers that will work for replacement

 Hi James,
I don't have the answer for you, but I've run into the same sort of situation where I needed a part and wanted to find the maximum amount of compatible part numbers to search for to increase the odds of finding one and give me the most options in terms of price and availability.
First step is to go to an appliance parts website that sells OEM factory parts for your specific model; make sure you're searching by model number. Locate the part number that you need, and any variants or superseded numbers that are also present.
For the next step you can use a general internet search, but I feel like I have better luck in most cases just searching on eBay. Put in the part number(s) you found so far into the eBay search, then go through the listings that come up. There will usually be more part numbers in the listings, so add them to your search as you find them.
Repeat until you feel you have a sufficient quantity of numbers, then you can use them all as the basis for a general internet (Google) search for what you need.
