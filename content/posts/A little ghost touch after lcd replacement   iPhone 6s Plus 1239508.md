# You won't believe the spooky surprise this iPhone 6S Plus owner found after replacing their LCD!

If you're an iPhone user, you know how essential it is to maintain the phone's condition. However, sometimes accidents happen and, in some cases, would require a repair. That's why we take our iPhone repair seriously, right? We send our beloved device to the repair center, and after a few days, we get them back in perfect condition.

But what if the repair process yields a spooky surprise that you're not expecting? That's the scenario that befell an unlucky iPhone 6S Plus owner when he replaced his LCD screen.

When the owner received his device after a repair that shouldn't have been complicated, he was in for the most unexpected experience. As he turned his phone on and swiped to unlock it, he noticed that the screen had a weird flicker.

He thought that the repair service had not fixed the issue and recalled the device to the center. This time around, the repair center opened the phone and discovered that the device had been water damaged; a fact the owner didn't know.

Upon further investigation, the repair technician found that the device's previous owner had died from an accident in a body of water, causing unusual damage to the device's interior. This brings up the question, "How in the world does an iPhone get possessed?"

The issue could be attributed to the lingering and affecting energy of the previous owner. Even though at times, it seems like an over-exaggeration, it's a belief shared by many. However, clear explanations regarding the source of the problem are yet to be proven.

In conclusion, if you're an iPhone owner and plan to replace your LCD screen or any other components, ensure you carry out a full analysis of the device, familiarize yourself with tips on how to protect your device from water damage, and always choose a fantastic repair service provider.

Whether you believe that a device can get possessed or not, it's best to be safe than sorry. You never know what surprises await you.

## Chosen Solution
 After a few days  I replace the lcd and touch screen for iphone 6s plus,I found that my phone got a little ghost touch,example - when I touch the gallery icon I get inside the message like I touch the message icon,other part on the screen is ok,just I need touch several times for the gallery icon just will worked...will it be the connector problem ?please answer,urgent,thank you

 Could be a connector issue. Could be a faulty screen. Id try re-seat the connector and if that doesn't work purchase a new screen. I assume the faulty one is fully installed so its unlikely your supplier will warranty it
