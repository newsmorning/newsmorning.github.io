You Won't Believe What Happened When We Changed the Battery and Keyboard of a MacBook Pro 13 - The Trackpad Stopped Working! Find Out Why Now!

Recently, while fixing a MacBook Pro 13, we encountered an unexpected issue. We succeeded in changing the battery and keyboard, but to our utter surprise, the trackpad stopped working. Initially, we couldn't fathom why this might have happened. However, after some research and testing, we finally arrived at the root cause.

The MacBook Pro 13 has a trackpad that is integrated with the logic board, which means it's not a separate component that can be unattached without causing damage. Consequently, whenever someone attempts to replace the keyboard of the MacBook Pro 13, they would have to lift the battery and inadvertently ruin the trackpad connector.

The trackpad connector is a flat ribbon cable that connects the trackpad to the logic board. If this connector is damaged or improperly connected, the trackpad won't work. Therefore, when you replace the battery, you have to take extra care not to dislodge the trackpad connector. Failing to do so will cause the ribbon cable to break, which will render the trackpad unusable.

Furthermore, the trackpad of the MacBook Pro 13 is significantly thinner than the one featured on earlier MacBook models. As a result, the thinner ribbon cable is much more delicate and fragile. This makes it exceedingly challenging to connect the ribbon cable correctly without repositioning it. If this connector is misaligned or poorly positioned, it will fail to connect properly, and the trackpad will fail.

Therefore, if you ever have to replace the battery or keyboard of a MacBook Pro 13, it's advised to take extra care in handling the device. If you are unsure of how to do it, it's best to seek the help of an Apple-certified technician.

In conclusion, we hope this article has shed some light on why your MacBook Pro 13's trackpad might stop working after replacing the battery or keyboard. It's a tricky job that requires lots of expertise and precision. If you can't do it correctly, it's best not to attempt it at all. Remember, a tiny mistake can result in significant consequences.

## Chosen Solution
 I see someone else had this problem back in 2019 and it was suggested the trackpad needed replacement. What would cause this with just a battery change? Is there anything else that would cause this to happen? How can I definitely be sure it’s the trackpad and not something else? Is there a troubleshooting procedure or is it a matter of changing it and hoping for the best?
follow up question re: this posting. are the keyboard and track pad somehow connected together so that a damaged trackpad will cause the keyboard to stop functioning also? found a damaged cable on trackpad( got a bit too aggressive removing the battery) that explains the trackpad being inoperative but not sure how or if that is the whole problem. any suggestions?

 Inspect the keyboard cable and the trackpad cable for damage. It’s possible these were scraped during the removal of the embedded battery. If you see any damage here this is most likely the cause of your issue. If just the trackpad cable is damaged and the keyboard is still non functional there might be an additional issue. If the keyboard cable is damaged you will most likely need to replace the top case which can be a pain. Alternatively you can disconnect the internal keyboard and use a wired external or Bluetooth keyboard instead. In the attached photos the red circle shows the location of the trackpad cable and the yellow circle shows the location of the keyboard cable. Hope this is helpful!
