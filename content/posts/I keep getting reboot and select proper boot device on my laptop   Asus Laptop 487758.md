## Chosen Solution
 I got a message saying windows encountered a problem with a frowned smile on a blue background.  Now anytime , I try to turn it on it displays : Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key on a black background. Please help , I'm  confused . I have some slides I have to submit as my end of year assessment on it.

 Kennedy Geraldo sounds like your computer cannot find the boot record. Check the computers BIOS to see if it recognizes the drive. If so, check the boot order in your computers bios. Set it to USB and get a bootable USB drive. I usually use a live version of puppy linux to see if I can access the drive and copy all the needed files. After that you can try to reinstall the OS. Of course that will only work if your drive has not failed. If it has, no software will be able to access the files. Let us know what computer you have and what you get when you try this. First priority for you should be to recover and safe those files.
