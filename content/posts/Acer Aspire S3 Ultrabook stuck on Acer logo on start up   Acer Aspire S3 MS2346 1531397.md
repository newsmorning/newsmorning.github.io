# You won't believe what happened when we tried to start the Acer Aspire S3 Ultrabook - stuck on the Acer logo!

The Acer Aspire S3 Ultrabook is a sleek, lightweight laptop that looks stylish and performs great. It's perfect for people who are always on-the-go and need a reliable device to work on. However, recently we encountered a surprising glitch that left us scratching our heads.

We were excited to try out the Aspire S3 Ultrabook and see what it could do. We had heard great things about its speed and performance, and we were eager to see it for ourselves. We opened the lid, pushed the power button, and waited for the magic to happen. But instead of booting up as usual, the laptop got stuck on the Acer logo screen.

At first, we thought maybe it was just a fluke or a temporary glitch. We tried pressing some buttons, waiting a few minutes, and then turning it back on. But the same thing happened again - the laptop got stuck on the Acer logo screen and wouldn't proceed any further.

We were beginning to get worried. What if something was seriously wrong with the Ultrabook? Did we break it somehow? We decided to search online for some solutions.

After some research, we found out that this was a common problem with the Aspire S3 Ultrabook. Many people had encountered the same issue and had found some quick fixes. We tried a few of these solutions and were relieved when the laptop finally started up as normal.

Here are some of the things we tried:

**1. Resetting the laptop's BIOS settings**

We tried resetting the laptop's BIOS settings by pressing the F2 key as soon as we turned on the device. This took us to the BIOS setup screen, and we selected the "Load Default Settings" option. This reset the laptop to its original settings and allowed it to boot up properly.

**2. Disconnecting all external devices**

We unplugged all external devices, including the power cord, mouse, and keyboard. We then held down the power button for 30 seconds to discharge any remaining power. After we reconnected everything and turned on the laptop, it booted up without any issues.

**3. Updating the laptop's BIOS**

We downloaded the latest BIOS update from the Acer website and installed it on the laptop. This fixed the issue and prevented it from happening again in the future.

After trying these solutions, we were relieved that the laptop was working again. We were also impressed with how quickly and easily we were able to find solutions online. It's always a good idea to do some research before panicking or assuming the worst.

In conclusion, the Acer Aspire S3 Ultrabook is a great device that offers impressive performance and style. However, if you encounter a stuck Acer logo screen like we did, don't panic! There are some simple solutions that you can try to get your laptop up and running again.

## Chosen Solution
 My daughter was on the Acer S3 MS2346 when she accidentally  unplugged it and ever since it will not start up stuck on Acer logo.  Can it be repaired?

 It may be repaired if someone can run some diagnostic software on the system to find out exactly what went wrong when the computer was accidentally unplugged.  The malfunctioning component may have to be replaced.
Please be aware that since this is a laptop, the repairs may cost than the computer is worth in some repair shops.
