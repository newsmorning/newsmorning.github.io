It can be frustrating when your Canon PIXMA printer stops working suddenly and displays an error code on the screen. One such error code that users often face is support code B203. This error code mostly shows up while you are printing or trying to print important documents.

If you have also encountered this issue, don't worry - we have got you covered. In this article, we will discuss what support code B203 is and how you can fix this error in just a few simple steps.

## What is Support Code B203?

Support code B203 is a common error code that Canon PIXMA printer users experience. It is usually caused by an issue with the printer's printhead, which may have become clogged or malfunctioned. This error can also be triggered by outdated firmware or corrupted printer drivers.

Whenever the printer displays the B203 error code, it indicates that the printhead has failed. The printhead is an essential component of Canon PIXMA printers that sprays ink droplets onto the paper to form the final printed image.

## How to Fix Support Code B203?

To resolve the Canon PIXMA support code B203 error, you can try the following steps:

### Step 1: Turn off the Printer

If your printer displays the B203 error code, the first thing you should do is turn it off. Press the Power button and let the printer turn off completely. Once the printer is off, remove the power cord and wait for 5-10 minutes.

### Step 2: Clean the Printhead

After turning off the printer, you can clean the printhead to remove any residue or clogged ink. To do this, open the printer cover and remove the printhead. Clean it gently with a soft cloth or cotton swab dipped in warm water.

Make sure you clean the printhead carefully and avoid touching the print nozzles as they can be easily damaged. Once you have cleaned the printhead, let it dry completely before reinstalling it.

### Step 3: Update Printer Firmware

If the above steps do not work, you can try updating your printer firmware. Outdated firmware can cause various printer errors, including support code B203. To update your printer firmware, visit Canon's official website and download the latest firmware for your printer model.

After downloading the firmware, connect your printer to the computer and run the firmware update process. Make sure you follow the instructions carefully and do not turn off the printer during the update process.

### Step 4: Reinstall Printer Drivers

If updating the firmware does not work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the printer drivers. Corrupted or outdated printer drivers can cause various printer errors and reduce the printer's efficiency.

To reinstall your printer drivers, go to your computer's Device Manager and remove the existing printer driver. Once removed, download and install the latest printer drivers from Canon's official website.
