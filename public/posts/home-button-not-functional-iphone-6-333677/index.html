Discover the Surprising Solution for iPhone 6 Users!\nAre you experiencing frustration with your iPhone 6’s home button? Do you find yourself constantly pressing it multiple times before getting a response? You’re not alone! Many iPhone 6 users have complained about the home button being unresponsive or frequently malfunctioning. But fear not, there’s a surprising solution that can save you from the hassle of replacing or repairing your iPhone.\nThe Solution\nThe solution to your iPhone’s home button woes is as simple as enabling the AssistiveTouch feature, which allows you to use a virtual home button instead of the physical one. AssistiveTouch has been created specifically to make using an iPhone easier for those who have trouble with the physical buttons. It is customizable, allowing you to set up your own unique gestures and actions.\nHow to Enable AssistiveTouch\nTo enable AssistiveTouch, go to your iPhone’s Settings and navigate to the General tab. From there, choose Accessibility and scroll down until you find the AssistiveTouch option. Turn on the toggle switch, and you’re done!\nCustomizing AssistiveTouch\nBy default, the AssistiveTouch button will appear as a white circle with a grey square in the middle. You can customize this button to whatever you would like it to appear as. Just go back to the AssistiveTouch screen and choose ‘Customize Top Level Menu’. From here, you can add or remove buttons to your customized menu.\nThere are a variety of things you can do with your virtual home button. You can set it to perform a single tap, double tap, or long press. You can also set it to take a screenshot, activate Siri, or even magnify the screen.\nThe Benefits\nWith AssistiveTouch enabled, you’ll no longer need to worry about replacing or repairing your physical home button. You’ll also be able to see the button no matter what app you’re using on your phone, giving you easy access to all its features with a single tap. Plus, you can customize its appearance and function to better suit your needs.\nConclusion\nIf you’re experiencing frustration with your iPhone 6’s home button, it’s time to try the AssistiveTouch feature. It’s a simple solution that can save you from the cost and inconvenience of needing to replace or repair your iPhone. Your virtual home button will be customizable and easy to use, making using your iPhone a breeze. So, go ahead and give it a try!\nChosen Solution It started with Touch ID failing. Then the home button wouldn’t wake the device, but once it was awake with the power button, the home button would work. Now the home button doesn’t work at all. I took it to uBreak iFix and they tested the home button and it was not the issue. At this point, the phone was 3 years old, so I upgraded to the 7 Plus, but I still have this phone sitting in a drawer. I got the home link cable and replaced that last week, but there still is no function in the home button. Someone on Reddit who claims to be an Apple technician said that replacing the display will fix it, but that doesn’t seem right on the 6 since the home cable isn’t integrated into the display like the 6S is. I’m really only doing this to maybe resell the phone and I just want to know if it’s even worth doing to try to sell it. It’s the 128 GB, so maybe there’s some value there, but if that eaten up in parts cost, I won’t bother.\nThe Reddit Apple’s technician’s suggestion comes from a well meaning place, but also a place of ignorance. When you are an Apple technician, there are only four answers to any problem:\nRestore the software Replace the top assembly Replace the battery Replace the whole phone The iPhone 6 top assembly includes about 8 parts that fasten together with screws (in this example, including all of the glued-together parts that make up the “screen” as one part). The top assembly also includes the home button and and the long flex cable which leads from the home button to the motherboard. Apple’s technicians never take apart this top assembly. They consider the entire top half of the phone to be the “screen,” including your home button and long home flex. So when you bring your phone to an Apple store with either a home button problem or a screen problem, they always change both together. This is also how earpiece speaker or front camera problem are fixed at Apple - by replacing the “screen.” It’s good in that Apple wants to ensure a high level of quality control though more new parts/less labor, but bad in that when you need a $2 speaker or $5 flex, the answer is a $149 “screen repair.” The Apple store is the only option if you want a new home button to include Touch ID. However, the independent store you brought to phone into has already tested a new button for its ability to click. You have already tested a new long home flex. As far as your issues are concerned, having Apple change the whole top assembly will accomplish no more than changing the home/home flex. You may want to visit one more independent that has both parts in stock, just in case a part new part caused this issue to be misdiagnosed. Find a local shop with good reviews that will not charge a diagnostic fee if they cannot fix it. Beyond that, your problem would have to be caused by damage to the home button FPC Connector on the motherboard, or damage to the Touch ID circuit., meaning power is not being sent to your home button in the first place. Try to reball ic u2100\nCheck fpc home (j2118) pin no.2 from top left, if not looping circuit replace R2160.\nIf the screen was ever replaced on the device, I would check the flex cable on the home button for damage. Some repair techs are not re-sticking the home button gasket to the screen, which keeps the home button securely in place. When the home button gasket is not attached to the screen, the home button can begin to spin slightly left or right every time you press the button. This will eventually cause micro tears in the flex cable and eventually lead to a completely torn cable which will not work at all.\n","wordCount":"1080","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brady Lee"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-not-functional-iphone-6-333677/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Your Home Button Driving You Crazy?
