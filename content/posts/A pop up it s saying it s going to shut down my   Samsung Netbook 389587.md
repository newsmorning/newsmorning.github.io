Samsung Netbooks have been around since the early 2000s, and they quickly became a popular choice for laptop users due to their portability and affordability. If you're one of the many Samsung Netbook users out there, you might have noticed a recent pop-up warning that can be quite alarming. This warning indicates that your Samsung Netbook is about to die, leaving you without a laptop.

But, before you panic and rush off to buy a new laptop, there are a few things you need to know about this warning.

Firstly, it's essential to understand that Samsung released this warning as a part of their end-of-life policy. As technology advances, companies like Samsung must phase out older models to make room for new ones. By warning you that your Netbook is about to die, Samsung is simply informing you that it will no longer be providing support or updates for your device. It doesn't mean that your Netbook will stop working immediately or that the device is going to explode. 

However, it would help if you didn't take this warning lightly as the lack of support from the company can lead to some serious issues. Your Samsung Netbook will become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and software bugs. Without updates, you're leaving your device open to potential security breaches. Furthermore, as the software and operating systems advance, the software installed on your Netbook will become outdated, making it impossible to run some of the newer programs.

So, what should you do if you receive this warning on your Samsung Netbook? 

Firstly, you need to back up essential data regularly. With no support for your device, there's no guarantee that your data will remain safe. While it can be annoying to back up regularly, it's crucial as it can save you from losing everything on your device.

Secondly, you may want to consider upgrading your device. While your Netbook may have served you well, it's time to move on to something new. Upgrading to a newer model or a different brand entirely will ensure that you get tech support and updates when needed. It's also an opportunity to improve your device's features, such as better graphics, enhanced performance, and a more extensive battery life.

In conclusion, the pop-up warning that your Samsung Netbook is about to die is not necessarily an emergency. However, ignoring the warning puts your data and device at risk. By backing up your data regularly and upgrading to a new device, you can avoid disastrous consequences. So, if you're a Samsung Netbook user, take heed of the warning, and start considering moving on to a new device.

## Chosen Solution
 A pop-up it's saying it's going to shut down my tablet what can I do

 Hi,
What is the model number of the tablet?
Try starting the tablet in safe mode and check if it still happens. Search online for Samsung (inset tablet model number) safe mode to find out how to do it for your model.
If it works OK in safe mode a downloaded app is the cause of the problem. A downloaded app is one that you downloaded and installed on the tablet and didnâ€™t come pre-installed with the tablet. You would need to uninstall each downloaded app one by one and test the tablet in normal mode between each uninstall until it worked OK. When it does then the last downloaded app that was uninstalled was the culprit.
Alternatively you could try downloading, installing and running an anti-malware app (example only) and check if it finds the cause.
