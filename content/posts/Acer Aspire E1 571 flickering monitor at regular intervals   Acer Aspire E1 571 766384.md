## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
in my laptop Acer Aspire E1-571, the monitor is flickering at regular intervals, as you can see in the following video:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/19K0tiu0...
When laptop is connected to an external monitor or TV (VGA or HDMI), there isn’t any defect.
There is no difference if I move the monitor up and down, it continues flickering at regular intervals.
I can see defect always, during boot or in windows.
Where do you think could be the problem?
Thank you in advance,
Sergio

 Hi @sergio_78
Check to see if it also occurs when in BIOS settings area just to eliminate the remote possibility that it may be an OS problem
It sounds though that it may be a loose LVDS cable connection on the motherboard or the display panel or a faulty LCD display panel.
Here’s the ifixit Acer Aspire E1-571 Repair guide. This will help to gain access to the motherboard and the display panel so that the cable connections can be inspected.
The above is only what I think based on your question and not having seen the video because not everybody has a Google account so that your video can be viewed. Try posting the video direct on ifixit. Here’s how to do this. Adding images to an existing question
