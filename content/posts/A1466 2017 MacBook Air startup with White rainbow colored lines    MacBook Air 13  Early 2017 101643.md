## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I have a model of the MacBook air above that started booting, with chime, and the apple on the back lit, starting  as a white screen with rainbow lines to the right of the screen, then it slowly fades to a screen with black on the top and white on the bottom and the colored lines are still faintly there. I was guessing that there was probably an issue with the internal connector from the mainframe basically to the screen itself.  I have tried all the alt/shift/control/hard reset options and memory resets with no change in the screen.
Two questions -
What is the issue, if anyone can pinpoint it (I have video and picture of the issues as well) with how to correct it?Is there a way to attach a monitor and bypass the laptop screen without being able to access the homescreen?
Thanks.
