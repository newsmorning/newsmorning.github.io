If you are only looking for a webcam for work, there are a variety of budget-friendly options out there, but many of the traditional options can be tough to find right now. If you want to stream gameplay and use a face cam, you will want a camera that can stream at a minimum of 720p.

## Logitech C270i – $56 – 720p
