Introduction

Nintendo Game Boy Advance SP is a gaming device that has been around since 2003. With its unique clamshell design, it revolutionized the way we played games on the go. However, in recent times, some gamers have expressed concern over the charging light on their devices. In this article, we will explore why gamers are freaking out over the charge light going on and off on their Game Boy Advance SP and whether their device is at risk.

The Charge Light on Game Boy Advance SP

The charge light on the Game Boy Advance SP is a small LED light that indicates whether your device is charging or not. When you plug in the charger, the light turns on to indicate that your device is charging. When your device is fully charged, the light turns off. However, some users have reported that their charge light is turning on and off, even when the device is not plugged in.

Why Gamers Are Freaking Out

Gamers are freaking out because they believe that the charge light issue could be a sign of a bigger problem. One theory is that the battery is failing, which could result in the device not charging properly and eventually becoming unusable. Another theory is that the charging port is damaged, which could result in the device not charging at all.

Is Your Device at Risk?

If your Game Boy Advance SP charge light is turning on and off, it doesn't necessarily mean that your device is at risk. The issue could be caused by a loose connection or a faulty charger. It's important to troubleshoot the issue before jumping to conclusions. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Check your charger - Make sure that your charger is working properly. Try using a different charger to see if the issue persists.

2. Clean the charging port - Use a soft-bristled brush or a cotton swab to clean the charging port. Dirt and debris can sometimes interfere with the charging process.

3. Replace the battery - If you have tried the above steps and the issue still persists, it's time to replace the battery. You can purchase a replacement battery online or take your device to a professional repair shop.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the charge light issue on the Game Boy Advance SP is not uncommon. While it can be concerning for some gamers, it doesn't necessarily mean that their device is at risk. By troubleshooting the issue and taking some basic steps, gamers can ensure that their device continues to function properly. Remember to always take care of your gaming devices, and they will provide you with endless hours of fun and entertainment.

## Chosen Solution
 I plug in my charger and the charging light flashes on for about a second before it turns off. I'm pretty sure it's not the charger because it works with another GBA SP, though that one is a slightly different model.
The model that isn't working is the newer one, with the brighter screen. I don't know if that has anything to do with the problem. It's also not the battery because it works in my other GBA SP, the older model.

 Hey Daniel,
Make sure the charger you are using is the proper voltage to charge the device. If it's too little, it will not take a charge, you may see a little light like you said.
The charge cable may not be the problem, it may be the port you are plugging the cable in to. This port is soldered on to the motherboard of the Gameboy, and if it has become loose, you will not be able to charge it with ANY charger. If you have basic soldering skills, this is not a difficult repair, if you do not have an electronic repair background, I would advise selling it for parts, and purchasing another one.
Have a good one, sir. :)

 Bought a few GBA SP’s in a lot a few weeks back, I had this issue with 2 of them. The orange charge-light would come on briefly for about 1 second then turn off. 

Over the last few years I’ve heard everything from “bridge/replace the F1 fuse” to “replace the charging port”, but I think I can safely safe 9 times out of 10 it’s just the battery that’s dead. I just finished fixing  these 2 GBA’s and both of them work fine now that I put in good replacement batteries. The charge light stays on while charging. 

Advice;
- Check the charge port contacts to make sure they’re clean and there’s no bent pins. If the power adapter charge-plug can’t touch the charge-port  contacts of the GBA SP itself, it’s needs to be replaced. Sometimes if the connection is also loose you might need to “bend” the  charging-cable while it’s plugged in to make full contact with the GBA SP’s charging port. If it still works then great, but you’ll probably need to replace it sooner or later if that’s the case. Give it a wiggle, see if that helps. That’ll tell you if it’s the charge port or something else on the board.
- Try a different charging cable.
- Check the connections of the GBA SP charge-port itself to the motherboard. Open it up and look. If it looks like the solder-points have cracked and they’re not making contact, use a soldering iron to lightly ‘touch-up’ the charge port contacts to the motherboard and re-melt the solder that’s available or add some solder, as well as touch up the 4 tiny legs of EM8 just below/near the charge-port itself. EM8 is a main power-regulator for the GBA SP boards from what I’ve figured out, sometimes if that has a bad contact it can disrupt the charging process too.
- Try putting in a new battery, or try with someone else’s battery first to see if their battery will work in your GBA SP. Then you’ll know for-sure that you just need a cheap battery replacement bought online.
New batteries are about 5-20$ depending where you buy them, I generally buy most of my little spare parts from Aliexpress. The shipping can be rough to wait for since most of the products are coming out of China, but the parts I get are generally good and work right. Out of 20 GBA SP batteries I bought in bulk for $1.38 (CAD) each, I had 2 that were a duds. It just happens when you buy something cheap in bulk, once in a while it ain’t gonna work right. 

I’m not an expert, these are just nuggets of experience I’ve had in my years of fixing Gameboys, Gameboy colors, Gameboy Advance SP’s, and the odd DS/3DS. I do this as a hobby, so if anyone can provide a more clear response then please feel free to add more. Hope this helps!

 try taking out the batteries and putting it back then charging it that worked for me

 If it does that it means the battery is full :D I also didn't know that and thought it was broken but it isn't bad IT JUST MEANS THE BATTERY IS FULL

 I bought this from another seller and it worked before, but I tested it now and it does not want to charge up (the light indicator would show but then quickly disappear).

 This happened to me too. Luckily, my brother has another Gameboy advance SP that didn't work except for the battery.  I swapped batteries and it appears to be working  again.

 This also happens when you fry your charger, a bit. I've opened up my charger and can see that the capacitor (if not mistaken) was loose. The solder has melted and loosen up the foot of the capacitor on the circuitry of the charger. I re-soldered it and good to go.
#This should affect all the GBA charged with this particular charger.

 It's most likely the battery is full or the battery is completely dead and you have to swap it with another one

 This happened to me but turns out the charging port on my gba sp was loose. I Discovered this when I shoved the charger when I was frustrated, this could be the problem so try to shove the charger in or something like that.

 Either the battery is already charged or it’s the battery that is not working.

 I have this problem today… jan 12, 2019.. the unit has been stored and forgotten for years, and of course the Battery is dead for sure…  I used the charger I originally use on my Brother’s SP and it charged normally. for some reason mine is not.. why is that? I’m sure that   i never had this problem before…

 Hi, i seem to have a problem with my gameboy advance sp ags 101. The original battery was dead  and i decided to swap it with another gba battery that is working. The thing is the little orange light thats indicating that the gameboy is charging is always oppen even if the gameboy is shut down or not plugged in. what can i do ? I fear that theres an issue with the mother board that just suck all the batteries.

 So I like just had this issue. What I do is move the head piece of the charger around in the outlet until the light flashes orange indicating that it’s charged. Don’t know if this is safe or if it’s efficient but I guess it works.

 had this problem and i just moved the charger while plugged in and eventually it worked lol

 I fixed the issue I was having. It was the EM8 Chip on the board that controls the charging regulation. I replaced the whole port (not easy haha) but think all I needed to actually do was reflow the 4 pins on EM8 to the board with a soldering iron. Hopefully, this helps someone before they replace the whole charge port like I did!!
If you are deciding to replace the port makho on youtube has a good guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYxizt8...

 I had this problem and I just got a q-tip with rubbing alcohol and cleaned up the charger and charging port, and then blew it out with a can of air, and it works fine now.

 Just to put it out there. I had the same issue, turns out the screen’s ribbon cable was dislodged slightly causing the charge light to come on only for a second, reseating it fixed the issue for me. :)

 Hey! I think I have an answer for most of you. 

If the battery swap doesn’t works, open your GBA SP up and be assured that the screen ribbon cable is properly and fully plugged in the motherboard - and that the locks on both side of the ribbon port is properly pushed fully down (or up if it’s not plugged in a perpendicular position). Most of the time when I repair a GBA SP with that flickering thing going on, that’s what is happening.

Also, it sometimes can create a random restart on your GBA, so it’s kind of a sign that your GBA SP doesn’t receive properly the AC/Power from the battery to the screen.

 Mine does the same thing but for 10-15 minutes

 Ok so basically my first gba sp was working fine until it run out of battery and i din't had a charger. So I crafted something different in the battery slot ( i putted a different battery type) and it was working fine. Sice the battery was 3.7 volts i was thinking there would no be some overvoltage or burn insode the gba so it was going fine until one day i tryed to turn it on and it just burned inside. I remond that the right bottom of the gba becamed very hot inside when he died and that all. Today i have a charger and when i try to plug it whit a real gba sp battery this time, the red light turn on and off even if i swap the battery whit another gba sp battery on my first faulty gba sp. ( i have a new one and this time i take good care of it) so yeah i try to see where is the problem on the faulty gba sp now but idk where . what i know is that it maybe resieve to much current flow and it burned somewhere on the power path on the pcb. Sorry if its hard to read, my native language is french.

 Sorry I’m late but this could mean that it’s fully charged. If it wont turn on try spamming the on/off switch decently fast until the green light comes on.

 Just had the same issue with a battery that charged previously. I swapped it out for another and my system was able to consistently charge immediately.

 There is not enough public info about flat batteries..if a battery sits long enough and discharges on it's own it will go flat.
sometimes, specially with newer batteries and lithium, you have to get some juice in them to get them started charging normally.
I sometimes can do this by plugging and unplugging the charger many times then leaving it plugged in for a while and doing it again.
power tools will seem to have bad batteries after sitting a winter etc.  they just need a jump start
