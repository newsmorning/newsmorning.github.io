Title: Is Your iPhone XR a Battery Killer? See How You Can Save Your Battery Life Now!

Introduction:
The iPhone XR is one of Apple's most popular models. It comes with excellent features, sleek design, and an impressive battery life. However, if you are experiencing a shorter battery life, your phone may be suffering from issues that drain the battery faster than usual. If you are wondering how to stop this problem, keep reading.

Body:
1. Find Out What is Draining Your Battery
One of the first things you should do is to find out what is draining your battery. Check the Battery Usage menu in Settings to see which apps are using too much power. Close down the apps when not in use, and disable apps that you don't use regularly.

2. Adjust Screen Brightness and Auto-Lock
Your screen consumes much of your battery life. Reduce the screen brightness, and set it to adjust according to the lighting instead of having it at full brightness all the time. Also, set the auto-lock time to a shorter duration.

3. Turn Off Unnecessary Settings
Several features are constantly running in the background, using power. To save your battery, turn off features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS when you are not using them. Background app refresh is another feature you may need to disable to lower drain rate- it updates apps automatically in the background, and so is one of the biggest battery hoarders.

4. Use Low Power Mode 
Most iPhone models come with a Low Power Mode option. When activated, it puts several settings on hold or reduces their functionality. You can access the Low Power Mode option in the battery settings. This feature can significantly improve your battery life and ensure that you still have a decent charge left when you need it.

5. Get a Battery Case or Power Bank
There are dedicated power banks and phone cases that come with built-in batteries that can charge your iPhone XR. This is a great way to keep your phone charged when you are away from a power outlet.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the iPhone XR is an excellent phone that comes with an impressive battery life. By implementing the tips mentioned in this article, you can save battery charge and ensure that your phone stays powered for longer periods. Try these tips out, and you'll undoubtedly see a significant improvement in your phone's battery life.
