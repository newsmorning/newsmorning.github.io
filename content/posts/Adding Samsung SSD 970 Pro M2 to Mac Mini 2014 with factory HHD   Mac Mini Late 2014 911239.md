Upgrade Your Mac Mini to Lightning Speed with the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2 – See How It's Done!

Are you tired of your sluggish Mac Mini? Do you crave lightning-fast speeds and performance? Well, look no further than the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2. This SSD upgrade can transform your computer and give you the speed and power you need to take on any task. In this article, we will show you how to upgrade your Mac Mini to lightning speed with the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2.

First, let's discuss the benefits of the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2. This SSD offers lightning-fast read and write speeds, thanks to its PCIe Gen 3.0 x4 interface and NVMe 1.3 technology. The 970 Pro M2 also comes with Samsung's Dynamic Thermal Guard, which ensures optimal performance and prevents overheating. Additionally, this SSD is durable and reliable, with a five-year warranty and an endurance rating of up to 1,200 terabytes written.

So, how do you upgrade your Mac Mini with the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2? First, you will need to make sure your Mac Mini is compatible with this SSD. The 970 Pro M2 requires an M.2 slot, so you will need to check your Mac Mini's specifications to see if it has one. Most recent Mac Minis do have an M.2 slot, so you should be good to go.

Once you've confirmed compatibility, you will need to purchase the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2. You can find it at most major electronics retailers, such as Best Buy, Amazon, and Newegg. Make sure to choose the right capacity for your needs – the 970 Pro M2 comes in 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB options.

Next, you will need to open up your Mac Mini and install the SSD. This can be a bit tricky, so we recommend seeking out a professional if you are not comfortable with computer hardware. However, if you are handy with a screwdriver, you can follow these steps:

1. Shut down your Mac Mini and unplug all cables.
2. Flip the Mac Mini over and remove the four rubber feet on the bottom.
3. Use a Torx screwdriver (size T6) to remove the eight screws under the rubber feet.
4. Carefully lift the bottom plate off of the Mac Mini. Be mindful of the ribbon cables connected to the board.
5. Locate the M.2 slot on the logic board (it should be near the RAM).
6. Insert the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2 into the slot at an angle and gently press it down until it clicks into place.
7. Reassemble the Mac Mini by reversing the steps above.

Once you've installed the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2, you will need to reinstall macOS. You can do this by connecting a bootable macOS installation drive and following the on-screen instructions. Make sure to choose the new SSD as the installation drive.

And that's it! You've successfully upgraded your Mac Mini to lightning speed with the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2. Enjoy your newfound speed and performance, and get ready to tackle any task with ease.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi everyone,
I've an old Mac Mini (2014) with the original “Apple HHD“ HD.
I’d like to upgrade it for better performances installing an SSD but since i’m frightened of taking apart the whole machine i’m considering to buy a SAMSUNG SSD 512 GB 970 PRO M. 2
I have two questions though:
1) Is the Samsung SSD 970 Pro M2 PCIe suitable for my mac mini?
2) Is it possible to have both original HHD and the mentioned PCIe installed in the machine or it’s better to replace the old HHD with a brand-new SSD?
Thank you in advance

 Actually I upgraded my mini (i5 2.6Ghz, 8gb RAM) with Samsung 970 pro myself. It was super easy: I bought an adapter for 8$ (with free shipping and tools) and installed it with this nvme added to it. In my mini, it works just perfectly, with speeds just above the 700 MB/s (that’s only because of mini bus limitations). But it’s still 2 times faster than my simple SSD which I have in the place of the old HDD.  And now I have two discs in place. So I just love this solution, as it made my mac mini much more usable, at least for a few years ahead.

 Sadly, Apple uses a different connector than the M.2 blade SSD’s. While some have managed to use an adapter to convert a M.2 SSD to work I really don’t recommend it.
While Apple SSD’s are a bit more expensive I would recommend you go with one of them or either a OWC or Transcend custom SSD’s which better match the Apple SSD’s
Here’s a good source of info and supply of the custom Apple SSD’s The Ultimate Guide to Apple’s Proprietary SSDs and here’s the guide to follow Mac mini Late 2014 SSD Replacement

 Unlikely without an adapter, best would be to get a good SSD with SATA interface.
You can only have 1 disk (either SSD or HDD) . Read the guide carefully - Step  34
