# You Won’t Believe What Happened When I Accidentally Unplugged My Switch Lite’s Power Cable from the Motherboard!

As a proud owner of a Nintendo Switch Lite, I always make sure to take care of it by cleaning it regularly and keeping it away from any harmful situations. However, just last week, something unexpected happened that left me in disbelief. I accidentally unplugged my Switch Lite's power cable from the motherboard, and what followed was a rollercoaster of emotions.

It all started when I was casually playing my favorite game on my Switch Lite. Suddenly, the battery ran out, and the device shut down completely. I plugged in the power cable to recharge it, but then I noticed that the USB-C port wasn't working correctly. Despite numerous attempts, the device wasn't charging, and I couldn't understand why.

In a panic, I decided to check if the power cable was damaged, and that's when I made the fatal mistake of unplugging it from the motherboard. As soon as I did that, the device went blank, and I thought I had completely ruined it.

With a heavy heart, I took the Switch Lite to a professional repair shop, expecting the worst. However, what happened next left me in complete shock. The repairman attached a different power cable to the device and turned it on, and voila! It was working perfectly fine, just as before.

I couldn't believe my luck, and the repairman explained that the Switch Lite's charging mechanism resets as soon as the power cable is unplugged. This meant that everything was back to normal, and my device was perfectly fine.

In hindsight, I realize that I had nothing to worry about, but it was a scary experience nonetheless. Sometimes, things can go wrong even when we take all the necessary precautions, but it's important to remember that there are always solutions.

In conclusion, unplugging your Switch Lite's power cable from the motherboard might sound like a terrifying experience, but it isn't the end of the world. Take a deep breath, seek professional help if needed, and remember that things will eventually work out. After all, a Switch Lite is more than just a device; it's a source of entertainment and joy that's worth any trouble that might come its way.

## Chosen Solution
 I was changing the joysticks in my switch lite and when I went to disconnect the power cable the entire connector separated from the motherboard. The first thing I did was look up if I could buy a replacement motherboard, but that would cost as much as the console itself and I simply can't afford to spend that much money. I am trying not to panic but I don't know what else to do.

 You just broke the solder joints and luckily your pads are intact. If you buy a cheap soldering iron you can solder it back and it will work again.
