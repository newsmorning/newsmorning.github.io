# Never Get Stranded Again! Simple and Easy Guide to Replacing Your 2014 Toyota Highlander Key Fob Battery

As a Toyota Highlander owner, you know how important it is to always have a functioning key fob. Without it, you could get stranded in a strange place, unable to start your vehicle or even get inside of it. That's why it's so important to take good care of your key fob - and to replace your battery before it dies.

Replacing your 2014 Toyota Highlander key fob battery is actually a lot easier than you might think. With just a few basic tools and a bit of know-how, you can have your key fob back up and running in no time. Here's what you need to know:

## Step One: Get the Right Battery

The first thing you'll need to do is figure out which type of battery your key fob uses. In most cases, a Toyota Highlander key fob will use a CR2032 battery. You can find these batteries at most hardware stores or online retailers.

## Step Two: Locate Your Key Fob

Next, you'll need to locate your key fob. This can be a bit tricky, as the Highlander key fob is relatively small and easy to misplace. Check your pockets, purse, and other bags, and be sure to look in all of the usual places where you keep your keys.

## Step Three: Open the Fob

Once you've located your key fob, it's time to replace the battery. To do this, you'll need to open the fob. You can do this by pressing the release button located on the back of the fob. The battery compartment should spring open, allowing you to remove the old battery.

## Step Four: Remove the Old Battery

Using a small screwdriver, carefully remove the old battery from the fob. Be sure to take note of which side of the battery is facing up - this will be important when you insert the new battery.

## Step Five: Insert the New Battery

Take your new CR2032 battery and insert it into the battery compartment, making sure to match the positive and negative sides correctly. Once the new battery is in place, you can close the fob back up.

## Step Six: Test Your Key Fob

Finally, it's time to test your key fob. Press the lock or unlock button to make sure that it's functioning properly. If everything works as it should, you're good to go!

By following these simple steps, you can replace your 2014 Toyota Highlander key fob battery and ensure that it's always functioning properly. So the next time you're out on the road, you can rest easy knowing that your key fob won't let you down.
