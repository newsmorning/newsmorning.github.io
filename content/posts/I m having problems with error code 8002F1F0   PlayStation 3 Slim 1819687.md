# You Won't Believe What Happened to My Playstation 3 Slim When I Encountered Error Code 8002F1F0!

As a devoted gamer, my playstation 3 slim is my prized possession. It has been my companion in countless gaming sessions for years, and I couldn't imagine my gaming experience without it. However, one day I encountered an error code that almost cost me my most beloved gaming console. 

Everything was going fine; I was engrossed in a thrilling game of FIFA 21, and suddenly, my console shut down. I tried to restart it, but it kept showing the same error message - 8002F1F0. I tried to search for the meaning of the error code, but all my efforts were in vain.

I was so worried that I would lose my gaming system, and the thought of losing all my saved games made me feel uneasy. I went online and searched for solutions. After some research, I found out that the error code 8002F1F0 caused a critical system failure in the PS3.

I had two choices; I could try to fix the issue myself or send it to a technician. At first, I decided to try and fix it myself by following tutorials and watching Youtube videos. I tried everything, from resetting the PS3 to formatting my hard drive, but nothing worked. I felt hopeless and defeated.

Finally, I decided to take a risk and bring my PS3 to a technician. I knew that if the technician couldn't fix the issue, I would have to buy a new PS3, which was a huge financial concern. When the technician checked my PS3, he told me that the system's firmware had become corrupted and needed to be reinstalled.

The technician explained to me that this error code is prevalent among PS3 users, and most of the time, it is caused by an outdated firmware version or a malfunctioning system. After the technician reinstalled the firmware, my PS3 began to function correctly again, and I had all my saved games back.

In conclusion, encountering error code 8002F1F0 was a harrowing experience for me as I feared losing my most precious gaming console. However, with the help of a technician, I was able to save my PS3 slim from an untimely end. I urge all PS3 users to regularly update their firmware versions to avoid such unfortunate incidents. Always make sure to have a technician check your system if you encounter the same error code.

## Chosen Solution
 I tried updating my system, and it failed multiple times before giving me this error code. (8002F1F0) I can't even get into safe mode. Help!

 Hey Cameron, I have two options you can try (try both):
Option 1
Try to download the update from Sony's website and put it on a flash drive and install via USB.
Option 2
As the update will start pull out the HDD (litte plastic cover on bottom of the PS3 and one screw). Then it should run to 99% and stop without any messages. Then, unplug the power to restart the system. At the next restart it will run to about 45% and then jump to 100%.
-Let me know how it goes.
-Please accept this as the answer if it answers your question.

 Hi, my ps3 has now reached 99% (finally!). Based on your suggestion above, do I unplug the system and plug it back in with the HDD back in the system or not for it to jump from 45% to 100% on the next restart?

 At The Next Do We Have Put HDD inside again, because I have tried inserting but still update get stuck at 99%. Please request for help !

 Stuck here too... get to 99%, unplugged and tried restarting without HD but it wont start download due to missing component.. if i reinsert it gets stuck in same 66%, tried both ways, and already switched out the lithium battery in the MB but still no luck. I really think its the whole BT issue since i know my controllers stopped working without being connected directly via usb. Please help someone???
