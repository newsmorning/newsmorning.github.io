Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When Liquid Was Spilled on the MacBook Air 13 Retina! Learn the Critical Voltages to Check on Your Logic Board Now!

Introduction:

MacBook Air 13 Retina is a highly popular laptop among people because of its lightweight, sleek design, and incredible performance. However, it's not immune to liquid spillage, which can cause severe damage to its logic board. Liquid spillage on MacBook Air 13 Retina may stop it from functioning altogether or cause severe problems that require extensive repair works. It's crucial to know the critical voltages to check on your logic board to ensure its proper functioning after liquid damage.

Body:

When liquid spills on the MacBook Air 13 Retina, it can seep through the keyboard and penetrate the logic board, causing severe damage to it. Liquid damage can cause problems with the charging of the battery, display, USB ports, and other essential components of the logic board. When the logic board of your MacBook Air 13 Retina is affected by liquid damage, it can be challenging to diagnose the problem without experience and technical skills.

The first thing to do when you spill liquid on your MacBook Air 13 Retina is to power it off, unplug it from the charger or any other device, and disconnect all the cables. By doing this, you'll prevent further damage and enhance the possibility of repairing the laptop successfully. After that, remove the casing of your MacBook Air 13 Retina and take out the battery, hard drive, and RAM.

The next step is to check the critical voltages on your logic board with the help of a Multimeter. Some of the critical voltages that you should check for include PP3V3_G3H, PPVCORE_S0_CPU, PP1V8_S0_CPU, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S5, PP3V3_S0, PP1V5_S0, PP1V2_S0, and PPVRTC_G3H. These voltages are essential to the functioning of your logic board, and if any of them are absent, it could mean that some components on your laptop are damaged.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, liquid spillage on MacBook Air 13 Retina can cause severe damage to its logic board. It's essential to know the critical voltages to check on your logic board to ensure that it functions correctly after liquid damage. If you experience liquid spillage on your MacBook Air 13 Retina, it's essential to power it off, unplug it, disconnect all cables, remove the casing, and check the critical voltages on your logic board using a Multimeter. By doing this, you'll prevent further damage and enhance the possibility of repairing your laptop successfully.

## Chosen Solution
 Laptop wonâ€™t turn on. I have cleaned the logic board, no corrosion marks on the logic board. I have checked the voltages and this is what I find.
Input from the charger connector: 21V
PPBUS_G3H: 13.3V
PPBUS3V3_G3H: 3.4-3.5V
The entire logic board becomes hot when I connect the charger. All the large caps heat up and it gets hot especially around the CPU area, not sure if this is normal. But not of the caps look burnt out.
Are these voltages right or are they too high? Not sure what to check next. Any guidance will be appreciated.

 You have a short within the logic board or connected part which is messing up the logic board.
What happens when you power the logic board by its self?
