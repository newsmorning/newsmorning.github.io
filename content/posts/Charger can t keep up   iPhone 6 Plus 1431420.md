Is Your iPhone 6 Plus Running Low on Battery? This Charger Just Can't Keep Up!

If you're an iPhone 6 Plus user, chances are you've experienced the frustration of running low on battery power while on the go. And while you may have tried various chargers, you may still find that your phone doesn't charge as quickly as you'd like. This is a common complaint among iPhone 6 Plus users, but luckily there are solutions to help extend your device's battery life.

One of the primary culprits of slow charging on the iPhone 6 Plus is simply the size of its battery. At only 2915mAh, the battery in the iPhone 6 Plus is smaller than many other smartphone batteries, which can make it difficult for the phone to hold a charge for long periods of time. Additionally, as the battery ages, it may become less efficient, which can further worsen charging times.

Another common cause of slow charging on the iPhone 6 Plus is the type of charger being used. While Apple's own charger should work fine, many third-party chargers simply aren't equipped to handle the high power output required to charge the iPhone 6 Plus quickly. If you're using a charger that's designed for a smaller or less powerful device, it may simply be unable to keep up with the demands of your iPhone 6 Plus.

So, what can you do to speed up the charging process for your iPhone 6 Plus? There are a few different solutions you can try, depending on your needs and preferences.

First, consider upgrading to a higher-capacity battery. While this won't necessarily make your phone charge faster, it will allow you to go longer between charges, which can be a big help if you're frequently on the go. There are a number of aftermarket battery options available for the iPhone 6 Plus, ranging from relatively inexpensive third-party batteries to more expensive options from reputable manufacturers.

Another option is to invest in a high-output charger specifically designed for the iPhone 6 Plus. These chargers typically offer outputs of 2.4 amps or more, which should be sufficient to handle the high-power demands of your device. There are a variety of different chargers available, but you'll want to look for one with a good reputation and plenty of positive reviews.

Finally, you may also want to consider making some adjustments to your phone's settings to help preserve battery life. For example, turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use, reducing screen brightness, and closing background apps can all help to conserve your phone's battery life and reduce the amount of time it takes to charge.

In conclusion, if your iPhone 6 Plus is struggling to hold a charge or charge quickly, there are steps you can take to address the problem. From upgrading to a higher-capacity battery to investing in a high-output charger, there are a variety of solutions available to help you get the most out of your device. By being strategic about your usage and taking advantage of available resources, you can help keep your iPhone 6 Plus powered up and ready to go whenever you need it.

## Chosen Solution
 I drive for Uber eats. Lately with my phone plugged into my car and the Uber app open and the screen lit at about mid brightness the charger can’t keep up with the battery drain.  I have tried the tips for less power usage in ios11 and that helped but it till can’t keep up.  A batt app says I’m charging and the battery has about 87% capacity left.
Will a new battery fix this problem?  Any other tests?

 You can go to 3utools.com and download a free program to your computer. Then, connect your phone and it will sync to the program and give you your battery health. Click on the link near results to expand a detailed description of your battery.
Also, using an auto charger can (and will) eventually effect the U2 (Tristar) IC chip on your logic board and will effect charging circuit. You may experience No Charging at all, Slow charging or Fake charging.
I would recommend getting a Power inverter installed in your car...or even one that plugs into your cigarette lighter so you can use a original charger plugged into it to keep your phone charged or find an apple auto charger, not a knock off charger as they will cause this issue too.
In short, you may need a new battery, test it... You could have a defective charging port or need micro soldering repair of your Logic board charging IC (Tristar)
