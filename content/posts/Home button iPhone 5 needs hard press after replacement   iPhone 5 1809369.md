Title: Stop Pressing Your Luck! Shocking Truth About iPhone 5 Home Button Replacement!

Introduction:

The home button of an iPhone is one of the most frequently used parts of the device. After continuous use, the iPhone 5 home button may become unresponsive, fail to click, or get stuck, which can be frustrating. While some people choose to replace the home button on their own, it is not always the best option. This article will explore the shocking truth about iPhone 5 home button replacement.

Body:

Firstly, home button replacement is not an easy task. Many DIY videos on YouTube may make it seem effortless, but it requires a lot of skill, patience, and the right tools. If you do not have the appropriate knowledge or experience, you risk damaging other essential parts of your device. Moreover, if you break any parts during the replacement process, you may end up causing more damage than the initial problem.

Secondly, using counterfeit home buttons may lead to more significant issues. Some people try to save money by purchasing cheaper non-Apple brand home buttons. These counterfeit products may work at first but may cause more serious issues down the road. Non-Apple parts usually do not undergo the same rigorous quality tests as genuine parts, so there's no guarantee about the quality of the product.

Thirdly, replacement of home button on an iPhone 5 is a sensitive issue that could affect the warranty of your device. iPhones come with a limited warranty, which is void if the device has been tampered with or if unauthorized repairs were made to it. Apple will refuse to service devices that have been opened without authorization even if the new home button was bought from them. The voided warranty means you will be responsible for any future issues that arise with your device.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, if your iPhone 5 home button is giving you trouble, it's best to have it repaired or replaced by a professional. Trying to replace it yourself is risky and may result in more problems than solutions. Using non-Apple brand home buttons may save you money initially, but can create issues down the road. Finally, remember that any unauthorized repair or modification will void the warranty of your device. So, stop pressing your luck and opt for a professional repair rather than attempted replacement.

## Chosen Solution
 So I was trying to replace my rear camera and ended up screwing the home button. I bought another and after replacing it it works for a day and then I have to press really hard for it to register a click. I open it lift up the two golden prongs that stick up and it works again for a day or so going back to hard presses. Is there a part I can replace or a fix anyone found for those pesky prongs? Which I think are my problem.

 Do you have your original button? Compare the two. I've had several replacement buttons for the Iphone 5 which have been to large, causing issues when I screw the metal plate down all the way. A quick solution is, before putting the phone back together, screw a little bit with the metal plating over the button. Loosen it / tighten it until it feels normal again. In your case it sounds like the plate is to loose, requiring you to press down hard for the button to get contact with the metal plate.
Fixed the problem for me anyways, hope it works for you as well. If the button is much larger/smaller than the original I'd suggest returning it.
