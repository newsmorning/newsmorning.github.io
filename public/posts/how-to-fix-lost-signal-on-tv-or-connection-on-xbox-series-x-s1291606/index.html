Now that they are fresh from the box, they come buggy, mostly showing n signal when laughing games.\nGo through the solutions to the issues and resolve your problems Even before the official launch, Microsoft announced possible issues with Xbox Series X|S.\nProbably spotted during tests, some of the bugs don’t really have a workaround for now.\nIf you have issues with Xbox Series X|S with no signal on TV, then check the solutions we provided below.\nDownload Restoro PC Repair Tool that comes with Patented Technologies (patent available here).\nClick Start Scan to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems.\nClick Repair All to fix issues affecting your computer’s security and performance\nRestoro has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.\nMicrosoft has warned since a few days ago about issues that might spoil the gaming experience for several users. Luckily, they also offer reliable fixes.\nIf you’re connecting the console to a 4K/120hz smart TV, using the EA Play/BBC iPlayer app, or trying a DVD/Blu-ray into the console, you might encounter on Xbox Series X|S no signal on TV, see this troubleshooting advice first.\nHow do I fix Xbox console common issues? 1. Lost signal to TV HDMI error with 4K 120Hz + VRR According to Microsoft, on 4K 120Hz TVs that also support VRR, one might encounter signal failures or corrupted images when the Xbox is configured for 4K120+VRR. The issue occurs with LG, Samsung, or Vizio TVs, but not exclusively.\nSolution:\nMake sure your TV has the latest firmware installed. Also, check that your TV is connected to the Internet and that Automatic Updates are enabled. Try resolution variations with/without VRR: Go to Setting \u003e General \u003e TV \u0026 display options\u003e Video Modes and check/uncheck the box for Allow variable refresh rate. Modify the resolution and refresh rate from TV \u0026 Display options \u003e Display section. Try 1080p/120hz + VRR or 1440p/120hz + VRR. Disable VRR on the TV altogether if the corrupted image persists. Additionally, you can perform a video mode reset and reset your resolution as shown in this troubleshooting article. 2. EA Play or BBC iPlayer app won’t launch/install In case the EA Play or BBC iPlayer app won’t launch or install on your new console, there is no fix, unfortunately. It seems that this is a matter of compatibility.\nGo to Setting \u003e General \u003e TV \u0026 display options\u003e Video Modes and check/uncheck the box for Allow variable refresh rate. Modify the resolution and refresh rate from TV \u0026 Display options \u003e Display section. Try 1080p/120hz + VRR or 1440p/120hz + VRR. However, Microsoft is working with its app partners for a quick solution.\nWant to play full games included with your EA Play subscription? No problem; access them in My Games \u0026 Apps \u003e Full Library \u003e EA Play.\n3. Dark HDR captures Another known issue is that HDR captures might appear too dark on the two consoles.\nOnce again, there is no workaround suggested yet, only a promise for a future fix.\n4. Black screen when inserting DVD/ Blue-ray This is actually a recurring issue with Xbox consoles: the screen turns black after inserting a DVD or Blu-ray disc.\nSolution:\nJust remove the disc from the console, restart your Xbox Series X|S, and then re-insert the disc. The issue should be fixed.\n5. Pixelated frames on the PeacockTV app Last but not least, users might see occasional pixelated frames when using the PeacockTV app on their console.\nThis is yet another unsolved issue, that Microsoft experts are still trying to fix in a future update.\nAs seen, some of the problems are acknowledged by Microsoft, yet with no workaround. This can only mean that manufacturer will release patches pretty soon, with one of the updates to come.\nUntil then, we hope that your gaming experience won’t suffer much.
