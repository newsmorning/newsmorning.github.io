Title: SHOCKING! Litom Led Solar Lights' Battery Replacement FAILS! Find out why they're not turning on!

Introduction:
In the world of outdoor lighting, solar lights are considered to be one of the best sources of energy-efficient lighting solutions. They use a small solar panel and a battery to power their LED lights, making them eco-friendly and cost-effective. While solar lights are easy to install and use, they can sometimes encounter issues, such as not turning on. One popular brand that has been recently getting attention for having battery replacement issues is the Litom Led Solar Lights. In this article, we will take a closer look at why Litom Led Solar Lights' battery replacement fails and what you can do to prevent this from happening.

What are Litom Led Solar Lights?
The Litom Led Solar Lights are a series of solar-powered outdoor lights made by Litom, a popular brand in the lighting industry. Litom Led Solar Lights are made with high-quality materials, including a durable plastic housing that protects the solar panel and battery from the elements. These lights utilize advanced technology that allows them to turn on and off automatically, thanks to a built-in sensor that detects the level of ambient light outdoors.

Why do Litom Led Solar Lights' battery replacements fail?
One of the biggest issues with Litom Led Solar Lights' battery replacement is that the battery compartment is challenging to access. In most cases, the battery compartment is located inside the light's housing and secured with screws, making it difficult to remove when it is time to replace the battery. As a result, some users may end up damaging the battery compartment or the wire connected to the solar panel while trying to remove the battery.

Another reason why the battery replacement fails is that some replacement batteries do not match the specifications of the original battery that the solar light uses. If the replacement battery is not the right size, voltage, or amperage, it may not work correctly or at all. This can cause the solar light not to turn on, even if the battery is brand new.

How to prevent Litom Led Solar Lights' battery replacement from failing?
To prevent Litom Led Solar Lights' battery replacement from failing, there are several things you can do. First, make sure to purchase the correct type of battery that matches the specifications of the original battery that came with the light. You can do this by checking the information on the battery or by referring to the user manual that came with the solar light.

Second, be careful when removing the battery compartment from the light's housing. Use the appropriate tools, such as a screwdriver, and avoid pulling on the wires connected to the solar panel. Doing so can cause the wire to break or disconnect, which can render the solar light useless.

Conclusion:
The Litom Led Solar Lights' battery replacement may fail if not done correctly. The factors that contribute to this issue include the difficulty in accessing the battery compartment and using the incorrect replacement battery. To avoid such problems, it is essential to purchase the right battery and handle the battery replacement with care. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Litom Led Solar Lights will continue to provide you with reliable and energy-efficient lighting that lasts for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 Litom LED solar light is not coming on. I replaced the internal 18650 battery. When I power it on it stays lit for few seconds. The LEDs will also come on when going through the three timer settings. The only problem is that it will not come on when dark. Thanks in advance.

 Have  had intermittent problems like this on 3 solar lights but finally solved it by cleaning what looked like a very clean sensor with Autosol polish, been working great for 2 weeks now.
