Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When You Fix Error 53 on Your iPhone 6 - Home Button Disaster!

Introduction:
If you're an iPhone user, you're probably familiar with Error 53. It's a problem that can occur when a user attempts to update their iPhone software. This error can leave users frustrated and seeking out a solution. However, what most users don't realize is that attempting to fix Error 53 can lead to an even bigger problem. In this article, we'll explore what happens when you fix Error 53 on your iPhone 6 and how it can result in a home button disaster.

What is Error 53?
Before we dive into the potential disaster that can come with fixing Error 53, let's first understand what it is. Error 53 is an issue that can occur when the Touch ID sensor and its corresponding cable are damaged or replaced. It's a security feature built into the iPhone that ensures no one can access the device without the owner's fingerprint. Error 53 is Apple's way of protecting the security feature from being tampered with.

What happens when you try to fix Error 53?
When users attempt to fix Error 53, they may replace the damaged Touch ID sensor and cable. However, doing so will cause the iPhone's home button to no longer function. This is because the home button and the Touch ID sensor are paired together through a unique identifier that is programmed into the phone's hardware. Attempting to replace the Touch ID sensor will result in this pairing being broken, rendering the home button useless.

Why is a non-functional home button a disaster?
The home button is essential to navigating an iPhone, whether it be closing out of apps or returning to the home screen. Without a functioning home button, users will find it nearly impossible to use their iPhone. They will have to rely on using assistive touch, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.

Is there a solution to this problem?
Unfortunately, once the home button has been rendered useless, the only solution is to have it replaced by an authorized repair technician. The cost of this repair can be high and may not be covered by Apple's warranty. Additionally, if the phone has been tampered with in any other way, this may void the warranty altogether.

Conclusion:
Error 53 can be a frustrating issue for iPhone users, but attempting to fix it can lead to an even bigger problem- a home button disaster. It's important to understand the potential consequences before attempting to repair an iPhone with Error 53. If in doubt, it's always best to seek out a qualified repair technician to avoid any further damage to your device.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi folks,
So I had my screen of my iPhone 6 replaced by a third party. As I know the phone will only work with the original home button it was placed in the new screen. Though after the replacement the touch id did not work, and strangely the home button didn't work to wake the phone, though when using the phone (after waking it with on/off) the home button did work.
Then I tried to update the firmware and got error 53. This means the original home button was not detected. Though, as I was 100% sure I had the original home button I replaced the flex cable for the home button en tried to restore the phone and it worked.
But still the home button does not work. not to wake the screen and now it even does not work using the phone after waking it with on/off. When trying to register touch id, it detects my thumb making contact but errors at registering.
What should I do? is the button itself broken? Why did it help to replace the flex cable?

 I would try undoing the flex cable and reconnecting it, If not you could try replacing the flex cable that runs behind the screen plate. I would also check the home button for tears as well, if torn it could be game over,

 Most likely home button has a tear in the cable. They tear VERY EASY. I have had numerous home buttons rip or tear just from popping the connector off. It takes very little to tear this cable. When you are removing the Touch ID it is best to take a heat gun and SLIGHTLY heat the Touch ID Flex Cable  so that it is not so Brittle and can Flex.....
