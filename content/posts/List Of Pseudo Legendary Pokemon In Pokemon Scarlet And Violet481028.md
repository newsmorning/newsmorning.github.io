- Garchomp
 - Dragonite

Unfortunately, Metagross and Kommo-o do not make an appearance in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. But they might return for a DLC or Tera Raid Battle event.
 
Baxcalibur is the new pseudo-legendary in Scarlet and Violet. This Dragon/Ice dual-type Pokemon is the final evolution of Frigibax found in Glaseado Mountain. This powerhouse has a massive base Attack stat of 145. Along with that, it has the “Thermal Exchange” ability. This makes it a formidable Pokemon against fire types as well. If Baxcalibur is hit with a Fire-type move, this ability will increase its Attack stat even higher. To get this beast, you can either start leveling up your Figibax or catch an Arctibax and evolve it.
As we mentioned, some of these are exclusive to a single version.
