If you're like most iPhone users, you rely on your device to stay connected, organized, and entertained throughout the day. So when your device needs repairs, it can be frustrating and disruptive to your routine. But what if you're experiencing a stalled repair, and you're not sure what's wrong or how to fix it? 
One possible culprit could be a mystery part that you may not have noticed before. Here's what you need to know to identify this mystery component and get your repairs back on track.

##The Mystery Part: What is it?

The mystery part in question is a small, rectangular component that sits near the top of the iPhone 11 Pro Max's logic board. It's commonly referred to as a "power IC" or "power management IC," and it's responsible for regulating the flow of power throughout the device.

While the power IC is a crucial component of the iPhone's power management system, it's also one that most users never think about. That's because it's a part that's typically only replaced by technicians during repairs, and it's not something that you'll find in your iPhone's user manual.

##Why it Matters for Your Repair

If your iPhone 11 Pro Max has been experiencing power-related issues, such as battery drain, restarting, or not turning on at all, the power IC may be to blame. This means that repairing or replacing the power IC is essential to restoring your iPhone's functionality.

However, because the power IC is a delicate and intricate component, it's not something that should be handled by the average user. Attempting to replace the power IC on your own could not only damage your device further but could also be hazardous to your safety.

Instead, it's best to seek out a qualified repair technician to identify and replace the power IC for you. This will help ensure that your device is repaired safely and effectively, and that you can go back to using your iPhone as normal.

##How to Get the Help You Need

If you're experiencing a stalled repair on your iPhone 11 Pro Max or suspect that the power IC may be causing power-related issues, it's essential to seek out professional help. You can do this by reaching out to your local Apple Store or authorized Apple service provider.

These repair centers have the tools, expertise, and experience needed to identify and repair power-related issues on your iPhone. They can also help you determine whether the power IC needs to be replaced, and can handle the replacement process safely and effectively.

Don't let a mystery part keep you from getting the repairs you need for your iPhone 11 Pro Max. Seek out the help of a qualified repair technician to get to the bottom of the issue and get your device back in working order.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I’m trying to replace a iPhone 11 Pro Max charge port and there is this square piece of board that looks like it’s attached to the flex of the charge port.
the new charge port flex doesn’t have this piece of board with it. How do you transfer it over? Can you buy this piece of port separately? What does the board do on the flex? Thanks everyone

 It looks like a connector bus or something. I’m a little surprised the new one doesn’t have it. At any rate, make sure you’re using a premium port and not an aftermarket one. The X and above will only work with a premium or OEM one. So if you inspect the small circuitry on the new port next to the old one and they don’t match, odds are you have an aftermarket port and will experience bootlooping issues. If need be, order a premium port from Mobile Sentrix.
