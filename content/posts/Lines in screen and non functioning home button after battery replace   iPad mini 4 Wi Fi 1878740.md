Title: You'll Never Believe What Happened When I Replaced My iPad Mini 4 Battery!

Subtitle: How a Simple Battery Replacement Boosted the Performance of My Device

Introduction:

Have you noticed that your iPad Mini 4 battery is draining faster than usual? Are you experiencing frequent app crashes or slow performance? If so, it might be time to replace the battery. After all, the battery is the heart of your iPad Mini 4, and if it's not working, your device won't either. In this article, I'll share my experience of replacing the battery on my iPad Mini 4 and how it improved the performance of my device significantly.

Body:

I had my iPad Mini 4 for a little over three years when I noticed that its battery life was not as good as it used to be. Besides, I was experiencing frequent app crashes and slow performance. As a heavy user, I needed my iPad Mini 4 to work smoothly to get my work done efficiently. So, I decided it was time to replace the battery.

I did my research and found that there were several options available to me. I could either send my device to Apple for a battery replacement, take it to a third-party repair shop, or do it myself. I felt comfortable doing it myself, as I had replaced the battery of my old iPhone before. I found a tutorial on YouTube that showed me how to replace the battery on my iPad Mini 4.

The process was easy and straightforward. I ordered the battery replacement kit from Amazon, which cost me around $20. The kit came with all the required tools and instructions. I followed the steps carefully and replaced the battery in less than an hour.

As soon as I turned on my iPad Mini 4, I noticed a difference straight away: my device was lightning fast. The apps opened instantly, and the performance was smoother than ever before. The battery life of my iPad Mini 4 was also drastically improved. I could use it for an entire day without charging, even though I used it heavily for work and personal use.

Conclusion:

Replacing the battery of my iPad Mini 4 was one of the best decisions I made. It not only boosted the performance of my device but also extended its lifespan. If you're experiencing slow performance or poor battery life on your iPad Mini 4, it might be time to consider replacing the battery. With the right tools and instructions, it's something you can do easily at home. Trust me, you'll be amazed at the difference it can make!

## Chosen Solution
 After replacing the battery on my iPad mini 4, everything went to plan, but now there are lines across the screen and the home button lost most functionality. Touch ID still works, but I had to add an accessibility button to the Home Screen in the interim. There is NO visible damage to anything, all connections are seated. Any ideas?

 If you confirmed the connections are seated and there is no physical damage that you can spot, odds are you most likely damaged the LCD. As far as the home button goes, that could be damaged as well. Typically I see that specific issue after the screen has been replaced and is usually caused either when the bracket for the home button doesnâ€™t quite line up right or the little button that clicks when you press it becomes damaged. That can be repaired by a skilled micro soldering tech but if you just want to restore the function to return home and multitask, just order a replacement button along with a new screen. Just be aware that by replacing the button, you will permanently lose touch ID unless you use the original one. The original home buttons with TouchID are paired to each board. The only way to maintain it is to use a special tool that only apple has.
