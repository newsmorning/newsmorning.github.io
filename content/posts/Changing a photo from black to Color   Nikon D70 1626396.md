# You won't believe the stunning transformation of this black and white photo after using Nikon D70 to add a pop of color!

As photography continues to evolve, it is no wonder that camera manufacturers such as Nikon develop cameras that can add a pop of color to a black and white photo. In particular, the Nikon D70 camera is one such camera that can enhance the beauty of a black and white photo.

Recently, a black and white photo of an old building caught the attention of Don, a professional photographer. The black and white photo was a beautiful depiction of the building's structure, but Don decided to use the Nikon D70 camera to add a pop of color to the photo.

Using the Nikon D70, Don added a vibrant orange color to the windows of the building, a deep green hue to the foliage surrounding the building, and a warm brown color to the bricks. The pop of color transformed the photo from a lifeless black and white image to a stunning work of art.

The D70 is one of Nikon's most popular cameras and has several features that make it a great camera for adding a pop of color to a black and white photo. One of the most notable features of the D70 is the color cast control feature. This feature allows the photographer to adjust the hue of the image to create a unique look.

Another feature of the D70 is the ability to shoot in RAW, which allows the photographer to capture more detail and color information in the image. This means that when the photographer adds a pop of color to a black and white photo, there is less loss of color information.

In conclusion, the Nikon D70 camera is an excellent tool for adding a pop of color to a black and white photo. With its color cast control feature and ability to shoot in RAW, the D70 can transform a lifeless black and white photo into a stunning work of art. Indeed, the stunning transformation of the black and white photo of the old building that Don captured proves that the D70 is a must-have camera for any serious photographer.

## Chosen Solution
 I took some photos using my Nikon D70. It was one of those moments that needed a quick grab the camera and shoot. Unfortunately I must have turned the mode dial either the last time I put my camera away or when I took it out to shoot. I usually keep my camera in Auto Mode but somehow it got turned to Portrait Mode when I took the photos. I was trying to take photos of a very rare large Ram on a rocky outcrop. It was standing tall very close to me and was magnificent.  I was so excited to be able to capture such a rare photo. However, when I got home and downloaded the photos everyone was totally black. I noticed my camera was in Portrait Mode. Is there any way to save the photos, turning them from black to what should have been fantastic photos?  My camera takes very sharp, crisp, vibrant color photos most of the time. Can they be saved???

 Steven I honestly don't feel that the camera being in Portrait mode has anything to do with your black images.
Have you verified that there actually are images on the card?
Did you have a lens cap on the lens?
If anything, portrait mode would have given you a well exposed image. So I don't think that is the cause of the dark image.  Verify that an exposure actually took place, but since you say they are black more than likely there is no hope.  Sorry.
