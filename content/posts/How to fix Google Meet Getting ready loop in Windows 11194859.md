# Is Google Meet driving you crazy? Discover the ultimate fix for the 'Getting Ready' loop in Windows 11 now!

Are you tired of facing the 'Getting Ready' loop every time you try to join a meeting on Google Meet? We know how frustrating it can be when you have an important meeting to attend, but technical glitches prevent you from doing so. But don't worry, we have a solution for you. In this article, we will guide you on how to fix the 'Getting Ready' loop issue in Windows 11 for Google Meet.

Before we begin, let's first understand why this issue occurs in the first place. The 'Getting Ready' loop occurs when the audio and video settings of your system are not properly configured. Whenever you enter a meeting on Google Meet, the system tries to access your audio and video devices, but since they are not properly configured, it keeps looping in the 'Getting Ready' phase.

Now, let's move on to the ultimate fix for this issue. 

## Step 1: Check whether the audio and video devices are properly configured

The first step in fixing this issue is to check if your audio and video devices are properly configured. To do this, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open the Settings app in Windows 11
2. Click on the 'System' option
3. Click on the 'Sound' option
4. Under the 'Input' and 'Output' sections, make sure that the correct audio and video devices are selected

## Step 2: Check if Google Meet has access to your audio and video devices

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Click on the three dots at the top right corner to open the menu
3. Click on 'Settings'
4. Scroll down and click on 'Privacy and security'
5. Click on 'Site settings'
6. Look for 'Microphone' and 'Camera' options under 'Permissions'
7. Make sure that Google Meet is allowed to access the microphone and camera

## Step 3: Clear Cache and Cookies in Chrome

The last step is to clear the cache and cookies in Google Chrome. This can help in resolving any issues that might be preventing Google Meet from working properly. To do this, follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Click on the three dots at the top right corner to open the menu
3. Click on 'Settings'
4. Scroll down and click on 'Advanced'
5. Under 'Privacy and Security', click on 'Clear browsing data'
6. Select 'All time' under the 'Time Range' option
7. Select 'Cookies and other site data' and 'Cached images and files'
8. Click on 'Clear data'

Meeting with Gmail has proven to be a successful integration for Google since it has made the service far more accessible to many of the company’s most loyal customers.
 
Furthermore, because Google Meet can be accessed directly from a browser window, the inconvenience of downloading and launching a separate application has been avoided. 
 
Sadly, Meet users have stated that the service has not always lived up to the billing and have experienced unexpected loading screens and delays. 
 
We have prepared below a list of solutions you can take in order to fix the Getting ready loop issue right after we understand why the error occurred in the first place. Follow along!
 
### Why does the Getting ready loop happen?
 
In the event that you find yourself caught on the loading screen for an interminable period of time, waiting for the Connecting icon to stop spinning, you might be inclined to ask yourself why does it happen.
 
While pinpointing the exact reason for the problem is difficult, if not impossible, we suspect that the entire problem is due to a faulty network connection.
 
When you request that Google Meet host a meeting, the service checks that all of the necessary hardware and network requirements are met before beginning the session. 
 
If one or both of the participants fails to perform under duress, the session will not be able to begin, and Google Meet will remain stuck on the Getting ready page. 
 
Moreover, if this is the case, we may be able to resolve the problem without causing shambles by using the trial and error method.
 
## How can I fix Google Meet Getting ready loop in Windows 11?
 
### 1. Check your Internet connection
 
If there is a connection problem, it is critical to rule out the most serious possibility on the list, an unreliable Internet connection, before proceeding. The most common reason for connectivity problems is a shaky connection, which occurs more often than you might think.
 
Before proceeding further down the list, make sure to troubleshoot your Internet connection. It’s as simple as going to a video streaming service and watching one or two videos to see if they’re playing smoothly.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

Alternatively, click on the WiFi icon from your taskbar to see whether you are connected to the Internet or not. If it turns out you aren’t, choose a network and connect to it.
 
Otherwise, if you are connected to a network already but the videos you tried to watch aren’t loading, you should unplug and replug your router.
 
### 2. Replug the camera
 
One of the most prevalent annoyances associated with video chatting and conferencing has got to be running into webcam difficulties. Google Meet, in particular, has become well-known for being plagued by the issue.
 
As a result, it’s usually advisable to unplug the camera and reconnect it to check if anything has changed in the meanwhile.
 
If you’re working on a laptop and don’t have access to an external webcam, you could delete your webcam driver and restart your computer to have the driver reinstalled again.
 
### 3. Reinstall the webcam driver
 
- Right-click on the Start icon then click on Device Manager to open it.
 - Now locate the Camera option, expand it then right-click the driver and choose Uninstall.
 - Restart your computer and it will automatically reinstall the camera driver.

### What are the advantages of using Google Meet?
 
Google Meet is a free service available to all Google users. Participants in the free edition are limited to a total of 100 people. 
 
A further advantage is that the time limit for free users is 60 minutes, as opposed to Zoom, which has a 40-minute meeting limit for its free edition. 
 
Of course, because it is organically integrated with other Google services, people who already have Google accounts will be able to quickly begin using Google Meet without any difficulty.
 
An additional benefit of using Google Meet is that it is really straightforward to use. It is as simple as clicking or tapping on a link to participate in a meeting. 
 
It should be noted that the platform’s default video resolution for both incoming and outgoing video feeds is 360p. The resolution, on the other hand, can be changed to 720p. 
 
In addition, users can individually adjust the resolution of the send and receive feeds, allowing them to have greater control over their data usage. 
 
Google’s global IT infrastructure, which has been in place for many years, provides assurance of security. Keep in mind that the organization adheres to internal and legal standards in order to protect data privacy, digital properties, and the interests of its user community.
 
It employs encryption to protect video calls, brute force attack avoidance tactics, and multi-factor account login and recovery to keep users’ information safe.
