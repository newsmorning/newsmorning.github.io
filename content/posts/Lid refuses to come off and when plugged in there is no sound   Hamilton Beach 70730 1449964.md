You Won't Believe What Happened When We Tried to Use the Hamilton Beach 70730 - Lid Stuck and No Sound!

Recently, we got our hands on the Hamilton Beach 70730 food processor, which had been on our wishlist for quite some time. Excited to see what it could do, we eagerly unpacked it and set it up. However, things did not go as smoothly as we had hoped.

As we began to use the food processor, we noticed that the lid would not come off after we were finished. We tried twisting and turning it, but it remained stubbornly stuck. This was frustrating because we needed to clean the machine and get it ready for our next use.

After a brief online search, we discovered that this was a common problem with the Hamilton Beach 70730. Apparently, some customers had experienced the same issue, and there were several solutions to try. We began attempting the fixes one by one.

First, we tried placing the food processor in the fridge for an hour to see if the cool temperature would loosen the lid. Unfortunately, this made no difference. Next, we tried tapping the lid with a spoon to dislodge it, but this also did not work.

Finally, we resorted to using a hammer and screwdriver to pry the lid off. This was a risky choice, but we were determined to get the machine open. Thankfully, the lid finally came off, but that was when we noticed that there was another problem with the food processor - it was not making any noise.

We checked to make sure that the machine was plugged in and turned on, but still, there was no sound. We tried running it for various lengths of time and even switched out the blades, but nothing seemed to work.

At this point, we were incredibly disappointed with the Hamilton Beach 70730. Not only did it have a lid that would not come off, but it was also not functioning properly. Given that the machine cost us a considerable sum of money, we expected better.

In conclusion, our experience with the Hamilton Beach 70730 was less than satisfying. While the idea of having a food processor to make our lives easier was exciting, the reality was that we encountered multiple issues with the machine. We hope that the company can address these problems and improve their product for the sake of future customers.

## Chosen Solution
 I got this as a gift 2 months ago. I set up the processor based on the instructions then plugged it in...the processor did not work at all.
Now I am trying to pull down the machine and the LID is stuck and will not move even though I have tried turning it both clockwise and anti-clockwise.
PLEASE HELP

 Sometimes those bowls can be put on in the wrong position, in which case the  safety switch will prevent it from operating.  Check manual and compare the position of handle with your unit.  If it doesn't match, that is the problem.  Some extra force might be required to remove bowl that is put on in the wrong position.
