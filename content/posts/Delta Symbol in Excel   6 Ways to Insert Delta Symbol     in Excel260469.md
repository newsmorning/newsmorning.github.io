Unlocking Excel's Secret Weapon: 6 Mind-Blowing Ways To Add Delta Symbol!

Excel is one of the most widely used software tools in the world of business and finance. It makes the lives of analysts, accountants, and statisticians much easier, allowing them to manipulate large quantities of data with ease. However, while many are well-versed in Excel's basic features, there are some hidden gems that can take your Excel game to the next level. One such gem is the ability to add the delta symbol (Δ) to your Excel spreadsheets. Here are six mind-blowing ways to do it:

1. The keyboard shortcut method: This method is the quickest and easiest way to type the delta symbol in Excel. To do it, simply press the "Alt" key and type "0184" on the numeric keypad. This will insert the delta symbol into the cell.

2. The insert symbol method: This method involves using Excel's "Symbol" tool to insert the delta symbol. To do this, click on the "Insert" tab, then click "Symbol". In the Symbol dialog box, select "Symbol" in the "Font" drop-down menu, then scroll down until you see the delta symbol. Click on it, then click "Insert".

3. The copy-paste method: This method involves finding the delta symbol online, copying it from a website or document, and pasting it into your Excel spreadsheet. Simply locate the delta symbol, highlight it, right-click and select "Copy", then position your cursor in the desired cell in Excel and right-click and select "Paste".

4. The AutoCorrect method: This method involves using Excel's AutoCorrect feature to automatically replace a specific set of characters with the delta symbol. To do this, click on the "File" tab, then select "Options". In the "Excel Options" dialog box, select "Proofing", then click "AutoCorrect Options". In the "AutoCorrect" dialog box, enter a set of characters (such as "dlt") in the "Replace" field and the delta symbol in the "With" field. From now on, whenever you type "dlt" in a cell, Excel will replace it with the delta symbol.

5. The conditional formatting method: This method involves using conditional formatting to add the delta symbol to a cell based on a certain condition. For example, if you want the delta symbol to appear in a cell if the value in another cell is greater than 50, you can set up a conditional formatting rule to do this. To do this, select the cell you want to apply the formatting to, click on the "Home" tab, then click "Conditional Formatting". Select "New Rule", then select "Use a formula to determine which cells to format". Enter the formula you want to use in the "Format values where this formula is true" field, then click "Format" and select the delta symbol as the formatting option.

6. The custom number formatting method: This method involves creating a custom number format that includes the delta symbol. To do this, select the cell(s) you want to format, right-click and select "Format Cells". In the "Format Cells" dialog box, click on the "Custom" option under "Category". In the "Type" field, enter the custom number format you want to use (such as "0.00Δ"), then click "OK". From now on, any number you enter into that cell will be displayed with the delta symbol.

In conclusion, the ability to add the delta symbol to your Excel spreadsheets can add an extra layer of professionalism and sophistication to your work. By using one of these six methods, you'll be able to impress your colleagues, clients, and bosses with your Excel skills. So go forth and start adding those deltas!

Now let us discuss each of the methods in detail with an example.
 
### Method #1 – Insert Delta from Insert Option
 
Excel has many symbols in its arsenal. Using the “Insert” option, we can quickly insert the delta symbol.
 
Subsequently, it has a delta symbol with a center filled with black color.
 
- We must first go to the “Insert” tab. Under the “Insert” tab, find “Symbols” and “Symbol.”  Now, we may see the symbols window.  Next, from the “Subset” drop-down list in Excel, choose “Greek and Coptic.” As soon as we select this option, we may see the “Delta” symbol.  Next, we must click on “Insert” to insert the delta symbol. As a result, we got the delta symbol in cell A1. This delta symbol looks like a triangle with a center filled with nothing. To insert the delta symbol with a filled black color in the middle, we must select “Geometric Shapes” under “Subset in the symbols window.” And under “Font,” we must choose “Arial.”

 

 
As a result, we got the delta symbol in cell A1. This delta symbol looks like a triangle with a center filled with nothing.
 
### Method #2 – Insert Delta by Shortcut Key
 
The quick way to insert a Delta symbol with the shortcut is by using the shortcut key in excelUsing The Shortcut Key In ExcelAn Excel shortcut is a technique of performing a manual task in a quicker way.read more. For example, to insert the second delta symbol, i.e., “triangle with filled color,” we need to use the following keys.
 
- We must first select the Excel cell where we want to insert the delta symbol. Next, hold the ALT key and press 30 from the number keypad on the keyboard.

 
Note: 30 should be pressed from the number keyboard, usually located at the right end of the keyboard.
 
### Method #3 – Insert Delta by Changing the Font Name
 
We can also insert a delta symbol without any filled color by changing the font name. First, we must enter the text “D” in the targeted cell.
 
Now change the font name to “Symbol” to get the delta symbol without filling in the center.
 
So, we got a delta symbol. So text value “D” equals the delta symbol in the font name “Symbol.”
 
### Method #4 – Insert Delta by CHAR Formula
 
As we are aware, we have the Char function in excelChar Function In ExcelThe character function in Excel, also known as the char function, identifies the character based on the number or integer accepted by the computer language. For example, the number for character "A" is 65, so if we use =char(65), we get A.read more to insert special characters with numbers supplied to it in Excel.
 
In the targeted cell, we need to open the Char function.
 
Then, we must enter the number 114 and press the “Enter” key to get the character “r.”
 
We must change the font name to “Wingdings 3” to get the delta symbol without fill.
 
To get the delta symbol with center fill, we must change the Char function number from 114 to 112.
 
So, 112 in the Char function is a delta with fill.
 
### Method #5 – Insert Delta by Using Excel AutoCorrect Feature
 
Probably most people are not aware of Excel’s autocorrect feature. Using this feature, we can insert the delta symbol by entering the text per our wish.
 
In settings, we need to specify the text that we need to type. Then, follow the below steps to insert delta through autocorrect in excelAutocorrect In ExcelExcel's AutoCorrect feature automatically corrects commonly misspelt words, extends a short phrase to a full sentence, and even pops up a full form of an abbreviation.

Step 2: Now, in Excel, we must click on File >>> Options.
 
Step 3: We need to go to the “Proofing” and “AutoCorrect” options in the next window.
 
Step 4: In the below window, paste the copied delta symbol in the “With” box.
 
Step 5: In the “Replace” box, we must type the text as per wish.
 
Step 6: Now, we need to click on the “Add” button to add to the “Autocorrect” option, click on “OK,” and close the window.
 
Step 7: Now, we must return to the worksheet, type “ABCD” in capital letters, press the “Enter” key, and see what value we get in cell A1.
 
Rather than getting “ABCD,” we got a delta symbol here.
 
Since we have set the autocorrect option of typing the text “ABCD,” we put the autocorrect value as a delta.
 
### Method #6 – Custom Number Formatting with Delta Symbol
 
In dashboard creation, we have seen delta symbols with different colors. We will show simple data with how to insert delta symbols in Excel using a custom number format in excel.Custom Number Format In Excel.Excel custom number formatting is nothing but making the data look better or visually appealing.

For this data, first, find the variance column.
 
Step 1: To find the variance column, we must insert the formula:
 
 Variance = Actual – Target
 
Step 2: Now, select “Variance” data and press Ctrl + 1 to open “Format Cells” options.
 
Step 3:  In the “Format Cells,” the window goes to “Custom,” and we must choose the type “General Δ.”
 
Step 4: Then, we must press “OK.” Therefore, we will get a delta symbol with numbers.
 
But this is not the ideal way of showing the delta symbol. Both positive and negative numbers are indicated with an upward delta symbol, so we need to show positive variance numbers in the upward delta and negative variance numbers in the downward delta. We must copy these to apply two delta symbols ▲▼.
 
Step 5: Select the “Variance” column and open the “Format Cells” dialog box, then go to “Custom” and apply a format like the one below.
 
Step 6: Now, we must press “OK” to apply the formatting. We will now see the upward delta symbol for positive variance and the downward delta symbol for negative variance.
 
Step 7:  We can still apply colorful formatting for these variance numbers. If the variance is positive, we can use a “Green” color and use the “Red” color for negative variance values.
 
So, for this, below is the formatting code.
 
Thus, it will apply to the formatting below.
 
### Things to Remember
 
- The delta symbol comes in two ways: a filled delta and another is an empty delta.The CHAR function can insert both kinds of delta symbols in Excel.The delta symbol is used in the dashboard, created with eye-catching colors. To insert the delta symbol in Excel, ALT + 30 is the shortcut.
