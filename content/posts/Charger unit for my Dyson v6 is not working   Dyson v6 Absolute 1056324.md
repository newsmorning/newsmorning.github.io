Are you experiencing issues with your Dyson V6 Absolute's charger unit? It is a common problem faced by many users after continuous use. Read on to find out if your charger unit is failing and what steps you can take to fix the issue.

Symptoms of a Failing Charger Unit

The Dyson V6 Absolute's charger unit is an essential component of the cleaning process. It takes around three and a half hours to fully charge the vacuum, which then provides around 20 minutes of uninterrupted cleaning time. A failing charger unit can seriously disrupt your cleaning routine.

The first sign of a failing charger unit is that the battery won't hold a charge. Even after charging the unit for the recommended amount of time, the battery doesn't last as long as it should. This is a clear indication that the charger unit is not doing its job properly.

Another symptom of a failing charger unit is that the LED light on the unit doesn't illuminate when you connect the vacuum to it. This could imply that the charger unit is not receiving power or that the charging pins on the vacuum or charger unit are not making proper contact. 

Steps to Fix a Failing Charger Unit

If you are experiencing any of the symptoms listed above, there are some steps you can take to fix the issue. First, check the power outlet and power cable. Ensure that the power cable is plugged in properly and the outlet is functioning correctly. If the outlet is not working, try plugging the charger unit into a different power outlet.

If the power outlet isn't the issue, check the charging pins on the vacuum and the charger unit to ensure that they are clean and making the correct contact. If they are not, clean the pins gently with a dry cloth and try charging the vacuum again. 

If these steps don't work, it's time to consider replacing the charger unit. You can purchase a replacement charger unit online or from your local Dyson store. The cost of a replacement charger unit will vary depending on where you purchase it.

Conclusion

A failing charger unit can be a frustrating problem to deal with. However, by following the above steps, you can fix the issue or replace the charger unit and continue enjoying your Dyson V6 Absolute's excellent cleaning capabilities. Keep in mind to always maintain the vacuum and its components to ensure its optimal use.

## Chosen Solution
 There are no blue lights on the charging unit when I put my vacuum in to charge. I’ve checked the power cord and it seems ok.

 There are usually two answers to faulty rechargeable items - battery and related charging circuitry, the charging unit. The easiest check if familiar with a multimeter or digital voltmeter would be measuring the charger itself. Most chargers are plug-in units like cellphone chargers while others have a mounting base with the charging unit within it and having two chrome plated pins, a male/female connection for power or small metal plates. Most chargers are ac-to-dc voltage converters and polarized to prevent reverse voltage issues. Ac-ac converters reduce wall socket voltage to a safer low ac voltage. These chargers have ac-to-dc voltage conversion built into the appliance. Using a DVM set  to either dc or ac and measuring the pins or socket terminals ( labeling specifies the output voltage in AC or DC) can determine if the charging unit is faulty or not.  If the charging unit outputs correct voltage then the appliance is faulty. It’s presumed the vacuum unit wasn’t dropped  that may damage internal wiring that can render it unable to recharge. If the vacuum unit was dropped, a wire may break or disconnect. This may be a simple repair.
A rechargeable vacuum cleaner using lithium batteries may have its charging circuitry either in the charging base or within its vacuum unit as circuitry is miniaturized. If the vacuum doesn’t accept a charge then the unit’s charging circuitry may be damaged or one of the lithium batteries failed. Repairs are either thru Dyson or independent repair people capable of repairing them. Rechargeable lithium batteries  require special handling during troubleshooting and repairs. When inadvertently short circuited, they have a tendency to continue into a runaway state resulting in near instant overheating and erupting into flames as it self consumes with ts own supply of oxygen generation  making them extremely difficult to extinguish. Examples of lithium battery fires; Tesla electric vehicles, laptop computers, cellphones and spare lithium batteries used in vapes, igniting in pants pockets due to not having the terminals encased in a protective carrying case. Once rechargeable lithium battery overheats, many self ignite into a runaway fire, consuming batteries and whatever it powers.
