# You Won't Believe the Shocking Consequences of Kaspersky Being Added to the US List of National Security Threats!

In recent years, Kaspersky has been one of the most trusted and widely used cybersecurity solutions across the globe. However, the company’s fate seems to have taken a downturn as it was branded a “national security threat” by the US government.

The concerns with Kaspersky stem from allegations that the company is involved in shady dealings with the Russian government. The fear is that that the Moscow-based company could use its software to snoop on sensitive US government systems and steal top-secret data.

The US government has taken an aggressive stance to protect its interests, and the addition of Kaspersky to the list of national security threats is just one of the measures being taken. Already, several government agencies have been ordered to stop using Kaspersky products and services.

So, what are the consequences of all these actions?

### Loss of Trust in Kaspersky

The first and most obvious impact of this development is the loss of trust in the Kaspersky brand. With the US government labeling the company a national security risk, many customers will be wary of using Kaspersky’s software or service. This is especially true for government agencies, as they cannot afford to take risks with sensitive data.

### Damage to Kaspersky's Reputation

Kaspersky’s brand reputation has been seriously impacted by this development. The company has long been respected in the cybersecurity industry, but the allegations of being a threat to national security will undoubtedly tarnish the brand's image. This could lead to significant losses in revenue and a decline in market share.

### Long-term Legal Issues

The allegations against Kaspersky could have long-term legal repercussions for the company. The US government could launch investigations or lawsuits against the company or its employees, which could lead to massive financial penalties. This could be a severe blow to the company, as it will have to spend resources defending itself, diverting its attention away from core operations.

### Impact on Global Cybersecurity Industry

The decision to brand Kaspersky as a national security threat can have impacts on the cybersecurity industry as a whole. Other companies that provide similar solutions could also face backlash if they are seen as being untrustworthy in protecting vital data. This could lead to more stringent requirements and regulations for cybersecurity products and services, making it difficult for companies to operate in the market.

### Conclusion

The impact of Kaspersky being branded a national security threat is significant and far-reaching. While the allegations against the company are still under investigation, the outcomes of this move could have long-term consequences on the cybersecurity industry across the world. Kaspersky and the cybersecurity industry as a whole must work together to restore customer confidence and prove that they can effectively protect sensitive data.

According to Bloomberg, the US Federal Communications Commission has added Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab to its list of companies that pose an “unacceptable risk to US national security.” This is the first time a Russian firm has been added to the list, which is dominated by Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE. On Friday, the FCC added China Telecom and China Mobile International USA to its list, in addition to Kaspersky.
 
Jessica Rosenworcel, Chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission, issued a statement. ” The inclusion of China Mobile and China Telecom, as well as Kaspersky Labs, will assist in protecting our networks from threats presented by Chinese and Russian state-sponsored enterprises aiming to engage in espionage and undermine America’s interests.”
 
## What Will Be The Impact Of This Action By FCC?
 

 
Businesses in the United States are prohibited from purchasing items or services from the companies on the list using federal subsidies provided by the Federal Communications Commission’s Universal Service Fund. In addition, many other countries might follow the same steps and this will create a serious impact on the minds of people across the globe.
 
Because the companies are on the “covered list,” money from the FCC’s $8 billion yearly Universal Service Fund cannot be utilized to buy or maintain their products.
 
Telecommunications for rural areas, low-income consumers, and infrastructures like schools, libraries, and hospitals are also supported by the fund. The major impact can be a decline in revenue of Kaspersky until FCC removes it from the list of national security threats.
 
### How Has Kaspersky Responded To This?
 
In a statement on its website, Kaspersky said the FCC’s decision was “based on political considerations” in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and that the business “remains ready to engage with US government authorities to address the FCC’s and any other regulatory agency’s concerns.” The action was “unsubstantiated” and “reactive to the geopolitical context rather than a thorough examination of Kaspersky’s products and services,” according to the company.
 
However, it assured its customers that there will be no impact on its products and services and will continue to serve them as it has been doing for the past several years.
 
### Other Notable Controversies Revolving Around Kaspersky
 
- Russian intelligence allegedly used Kaspersky antivirus software to obtain confidential documents from the National Security Agency in 2017, according to an allegation rejected by the Moscow-based corporation. The corporation admits that it retrieved and analyzed the files, but claims that there was a legitimate cause for doing so, which was the presence of a pirated version of Microsoft Office on the machine. It’s a credible explanation for how the files were returned to Moscow without the corporation collaborating with or being compromised by the Russian government but does strike a doubt.

 
- Furthermore,in 2017, President Donald Trump signed legislation prohibiting the use of Kaspersky Lab within the United States government into law on Tuesday, concluding a months-long push to remove the Moscow-based antivirus business from federal agencies amid concerns it was vulnerable to Kremlin manipulation. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, went on to say that the company’s software posed a “grave risk” to US national security.

President Joe Biden has recently issued a warning about Russian cyberattacks on American firms. This has been stated by the President himself at a time when the world is witnessing the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war. Kaspersky does have a stained record of capturing confidential documents and who knows if Kaspersky can be one of the tools that would be used to carry out those cyber attacks that have been forewarned by the US government.
 
The decision to continue using Kaspersky is something one has to individually decide upon after analyzing and considering all the facts and figures available.
