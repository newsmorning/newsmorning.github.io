Title: Is Your Kenmore Elite He3 Washing Machine on the Fritz? Find Out How to Fix an F02 Error Code Now!

Introduction:
A washing machine is an essential home appliance that plays a vital role in our daily lives. However, with frequent use, it is inevitable to encounter problems, which can be frustrating, especially when you are not sure how to fix them. One of the most common issues that occur with the Kenmore Elite HE3 washing machine is the F02 error code. This error code indicates a draining problem, which can prevent your machine from completing a cycle. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to fix the F02 error code on your Kenmore Elite HE3 washing machine.

Step 1: Check the Drain Hose and Pump
The first thing you should do when you encounter an F02 error code is to check the drain hose and pump. Make sure the drain hose is not kinked or clogged, and the drain pump is functioning correctly. To access the drain pump, you will need to remove the lower front panel of your machine. Once you have removed the panel, you can locate the drain pump at the center of the unit. Check to see if there are any foreign objects obstructing the pump or if the impeller is damaged.

Step 2: Clear Any Blockages
If you find any blockages in the drain hose or pump, clear them. You can do this by using a plastic zip tie or metal clothes hanger to remove the debris. If there is too much debris, you may need to remove the entire assembly and clean it thoroughly. Once you have cleared the blockage, turn on the machine and check if the error code has disappeared.

Step 3: Replace the Drain Pump
If you have checked the drain hose and pump, and there are no blockages, the issue could be a faulty pump. In this case, you will need to replace your drain pump. First, turn off the machine and disconnect it from the power supply. Then, remove the pump assembly from your machine, and replace it with a new one. After installing the new drain pump, turn on the machine and check if the error code has disappeared.

Step 4: Check the Pressure Switch
If replacing the drain pump doesn't solve the issue, you may need to check the pressure switch. The pressure switch is responsible for monitoring water levels in the machine. If it is faulty, it can cause the F02 error code to appear. To check the pressure switch, you will need to access it by removing the top panel of your machine. Once you have located the pressure switch, check if there are any damages or if it is clogged with debris. If it is damaged, you will need to replace it.

Conclusion:
An F02 error code on your Kenmore Elite HE3 washing machine can be a frustrating experience, but it's not the end of the world. By following these simple steps, you can easily fix the issue and get your machine back to its normal functioning. Remember, it's always essential to ensure that your machine is well maintained to prevent faults and damages. This will save you both time and money in the long run, and your machine will serve you efficiently for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I also had an F02 error code. I attempted all the repair possibilties listed....checked drain pump and connections, checked hoses for possible blockage and then replaced pump all together! Tried to wash small load only to have the F02 code again. Still won't work...did the diagnostic test and it gets stuck at C:06. But when I advance the test program control it advances to the end of diagnostic test (C:07 & C:08) with no problem. When I tried to run a normal cylce (with empty washer) the drum doesn't spin like it usually does shortly after turning on. Help!

 ellen, there are a few more things you can check on. First off, and most commonly, check the pressure tube for any obstruction. Clean it out thoroughly. reason for this is "Normal drain will occur until the pressure switch senses no water in the wash tub and there is no foam (suds). The drain pump will operate an additional 15 seconds after the pressure switch reports no water or foam. If the drain routine operates for four (4) minutes and the pressure switch senses any foam (suds) in the wash tub, the Central Control Unit will start the “Kill-Foam” Routine. (See description of this Routine below.) After the Kill-foam Routine is concluded, the Drain Routine will restart. If, after four (4) minutes the pressure switch still senses foam in the wash tub, the Central Control Unit will go into Failure Mode. The digital display will show, F02." So, if a. your hose/tube would be clogged, your pressure switch will not work. B. check your pressure switch and see if that gives you the trouble. You may need to replace it. If any of those are good, it may get expensive. It could mean that you may need a new CPU. Remain optimistic and clean the hose first ;-) Hope this helps, good luck.

 OldTurkey03 is correct:
In my case the machine kept throwing F02 code (drain pump continuously pumping) even after thoroughly cleaning out drain plumbing and filter completely.
Removed pressure tube connector from back of tub housing (must remove rear cover for access) to discover it was completely fouled/blocked. This caused pressure switch to "think" there was still water in tub to be drained, even when empty.
Cleaned pressure tube connector, reassembled, and now machine operates normally again.
