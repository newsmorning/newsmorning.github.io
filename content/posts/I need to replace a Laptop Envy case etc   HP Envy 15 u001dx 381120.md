## Chosen Solution
 I need  to replace the Laptop Envy 15'6 case.
I also need to add 4GB of memory to use it as a 16GB memory laptop.
I also need HP to re-install my original OS Windows 8.0.
The free install of Windows 10 did not work, and Microsoft told me they can not fix it.
And left me with no OS. Just a Laptop that reboots with the HP logo  repeatly.
How long will the above repairs take, and how much will it cost?
Please by email to smytheh@excite.com

 I'd say everything would take you about 10 hours as far as installing windows id give windows 10 another shot id download the windows 10 boot drive installer you can get free here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software... and you'd have to go in the bios settings of your computer to install it its different for every computer so you'd probably have to go into your user manual. Installing the ram will take a matter of minutes just make sure you buy ram that's compatible with your computer. as far as changing the case goes you'd have to go at your own pace but that would probably take me about 4-5 hours.
