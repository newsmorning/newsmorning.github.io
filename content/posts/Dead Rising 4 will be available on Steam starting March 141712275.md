Title: Zombie Apocalypse Alert: Get Ready to Survive with Dead Rising 4 Hitting Steam on March 14!

As the world reels from the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it's hard not to imagine what would happen if a real-life zombie apocalypse were to be unleashed upon us. While such a scenario may seem far-fetched, it hasn't stopped gamers from indulging in the fantasy through popular titles like Dead Rising. And now, the long-awaited fourth installment of the game is finally making its way to Steam on March 14th.

For the uninitiated, Dead Rising is a survival horror game that sees players battling hordes of zombies in an open-world environment. What sets it apart from other zombie games is its wacky tone and over-the-top weapons, such as a giant pink chainsaw and a motorized wheelchair outfitted with machine guns.

Dead Rising 4 takes place 16 years after the events of the first game and stars Frank West, the protagonist of the original Dead Rising. Frank has returned to Willamette, Colorado, where he uncovers the sinister machinations of a government conspiracy involving a new strain of the zombie virus. Along the way, he'll team up with new allies, face off against new types of zombies, and, of course, craft all manner of insane weapons.

One of the biggest improvements in Dead Rising 4 is the reintroduction of a timer system, which was largely absent from the third game. In previous games, players had a set amount of time to complete objectives before the game's true ending was triggered. This added a sense of urgency to the proceedings and forced players to make difficult choices about how to use their time. Dead Rising 4 brings this system back, but with a few tweaks to make it less punishing.

Another new feature in Dead Rising 4 is the Exo Suit, which gives players an added layer of protection and allows them to perform superhuman feats like jumping high and punching zombies with incredible force. It's a fun addition that adds even more variety to the already-chaotic combat.

Overall, the return of Frank West and the focus on timed objectives should make Dead Rising 4 a worthy addition to the series. If you're a fan of zombie games or just looking for a good time, mark your calendar for March 14th and get ready to survive the apocalypse in style.

The zombie survival horror title supports up to four players in a separate co-op campaign mode. Dead Rising 4 marks the return of photojournalist and zombie outbreak survivor Frank West to Willamette, Colorado 16 years after the events of the original Dead Rising. West finds the town under siege from a horde of zombies and the rebuilt Willamette Memorial Megaplex Mall infested with entrails.
 
Capcom said in its announcement:
 
The game publisher added new features to the game, including a new exo-suit that provides superhuman abilities to West and a super stopping power to crush the waves of zombies. Dead Rising 4 also introduces new vehicle customization options.
 
Frank will not only be pitted against the zombie horde but also two new and dangerous kinds of undead creatures as he comes across spry and energetic freshly infected zombies and the dangerously intelligent Evo threat. He will also face a shadowy para-military organization and some not-so-friendly survivors who have their own opinions on how to make it through the zombie apocalypse.
 
Unlike the previous versions of the game, Dead Rising 4 also introduces the more sanitized Maniacs to get rid of the Psychos in the Dead Rising series. You can get a glimpse of the Steam version of Dead Rising 4 via the trailer below.
