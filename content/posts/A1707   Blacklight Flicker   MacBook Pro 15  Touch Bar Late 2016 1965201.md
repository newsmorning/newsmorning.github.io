## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
Just picked up a 2nd User 15” MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (A1707).
I’ve just noticed it sometime seem to go though a state of the blacklight flickering for a minute of so. More when I’m moving the Device (carrying) however if I change the brightness it will flicker for a second. Its not all the time. Just the odd now and then.
Anything I should be worried about?
Update (02/01/2019)
Additionally. I’ve turned off Auto Adjust Brightness and that seem to have stopped the issue. If that help? Is it a know problem?

 Does the whole backlight flicker or do certain areas such as the bottom flicker?
