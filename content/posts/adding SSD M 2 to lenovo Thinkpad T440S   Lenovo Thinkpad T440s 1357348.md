# Reviving Your Lenovo Thinkpad T440S: The One Upgrade You Need to Boost Your Speed and Performance!

If you own a Lenovo Thinkpad T440S, you know that it is a reliable and efficient machine. However, as time goes on, you may notice that it is not performing as well as it used to. This is natural, as any computer will experience wear and tear over time. The good news is that there is one upgrade you can make to your Thinkpad T440S that will give it a significant boost in speed and performance.

The upgrade we're talking about is upgrading your T440S with a Solid State Drive (SSD). While many laptops come with traditional hard drives, which store data on spinning disks, SSDs are a newer type of storage technology that do not rely on mechanical parts. This means they are faster, quieter, and more reliable than traditional hard drives.

By upgrading to an SSD, you will notice a significant improvement in your machine's overall speed and performance. Your operating system will boot up faster, your applications will load more quickly, and your overall computing experience will be smoother and more responsive.

So, how do you go about upgrading to an SSD? The good news is that it is a relatively simple process. First, you will need to purchase an SSD that is compatible with your T440S. There are many options on the market, so be sure to do your research to find the best one for your needs.

Once you have your SSD, you will need to clone your existing hard drive onto the new SSD. This will transfer all of your data, including your operating system and applications, to the new drive. Many SSDs come with cloning software, but you can also find free software online.

After you have cloned your hard drive, you will need to physically install the new SSD into your T440S. This will require opening up your machine, so be sure to follow the instructions carefully to avoid causing any damage.

Once your new SSD is installed, you will be ready to experience the benefits of your upgrade. Your Thinkpad T440S will run faster, smoother, and more efficiently than ever before.

In conclusion, if you own a Lenovo Thinkpad T440S and want to revive its speed and performance, upgrading to an SSD is the way to go. With the benefits of faster boot-up times, quicker application load times, and an all-around smoother computing experience, it's the best upgrade you can make to your machine. So, get started on your upgrade today and unlock the full potential of your Lenovo Thinkpad T440S!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello Dear
how can I add more space in my hard drive, I am planning to buy an SSD M.2 it will work with this laptop or not
Regards

 Here's a good write-up on how to add in a SSD into your system: How to Install an M.2 SSD in the Lenovo ThinkPad T440s. You'll need a SATA/AHCI drive.

 When buying an SSD, be sure to purchase an M.2 drive that is exactly 42mm long, the only length that will fit in the ThinkPad T440s’s narrow slot. Though M.2 is the next-generation of mSATA, it is not backward compatible so you need to make sure the drive is listed as M.2, not mSATA.
You’ll also need a small Philips-head screwdriver.
How to Install an M.2 SSD in the T440s
1. Enter the BIOS setup program by hitting Enter or f1 key repeatedly when the notebook boots.
If Windows loads, you’ll have to restart and try again.
2. . Select Power under the Config Tab.
3. Select Disable Built-in Battery and hit yes when asked to confirm. This will turn the computer off.
4. Place the T440s upside down on a table, with the power off and cord unplugged.
5. Remove the battery by pulling aside the clips.
6. Unscrew the 8 screws on the back using the Philips head screwdriver.
7. Loosen the six screws on the bottom of the system. Lift the cover from the system.
8. Remove the screw from the m2 solid-state drive. Lift the drive from the system.
9. Insert the m2 solid-state drive into the socket. Press the drive down and secure it in place with the screw.
10. Align the bottom cover with the system. Tighten the screws to secure the cover in place.
11. Reconnect the AC adapter to re-enable the built-in battery
12.  Clone Windows 10 to M.2 SSD
If your 2.5” drive is a mechanical hard drive, the M.2 SSD will be a lot faster so you may want to use it as your boot drive.
In order to do that, you’ll want to clone your original drive so that Windows and all your programs get copied over. Before you do, you’ll want to make a full system backup, just in case something goes wrong.

 Yes , unless the m.2 Slot is already taken by UMTS or so
