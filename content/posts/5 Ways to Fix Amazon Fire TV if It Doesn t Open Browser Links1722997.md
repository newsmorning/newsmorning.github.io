# You Won't Believe What Desperate Amazon Fire TV Users Are Doing to Open Browser Links - 5 Proven Fixes Revealed!

Are you one of the many Amazon Fire TV users who have been struggling with opening browser links on your device? If so, you're not alone. This has been a persistent issue for many Fire TV users, and it's frustrating when you can't access the content you need. But don't worry, we've got you covered. In this article, we'll reveal 5 proven fixes that will help you open browser links on your Amazon Fire TV without having to resort to desperate measures.

First, let's take a look at the problem at hand. Many Fire TV users have reported that clicking on a link in a Fire TV app, such as Facebook or Twitter, doesn't take them to the website they want to visit. Instead, it opens a blank page or does nothing at all. This is a known issue and is caused by the Fire TV's lack of a built-in web browser. While you can use voice commands to search the web, this doesn't help when you need to click on a specific link.

So, what can you do to fix this problem? Here are 5 proven fixes that will help you open browser links on your Fire TV:

## 1. Use a Third-Party Browser App

One of the simplest solutions to this problem is to download a third-party browser app, such as Firefox or Silk Browser, from the Amazon Appstore. These browsers will allow you to click on links within Fire TV apps and take you to the website you want to visit. Simply install the browser of your choice and set it as your default browser in the Fire TV settings.

## 2. Use a Shortcut App

Another option is to use a shortcut app, such as Shortcut for Fire TV or Firefox Shortcut. These apps will create shortcuts on your Fire TV home screen that will take you directly to the browser of your choice. Once you've installed the shortcut app, simply select the browser you want to use and create a shortcut. You can then access the browser by clicking on the shortcut on your home screen.

## 3. Use the Amazon Silk Browser on Another Device

If you have another device that has the Amazon Silk Browser installed, such as a tablet or smartphone, you can use that device to open the link and then send it to your Fire TV using the "Send to TV" feature. To do this, open the Silk Browser on your other device, navigate to the link you want to open, and then tap on the "Send to TV" icon. Select your Fire TV from the list of available devices, and the link will open on your Fire TV.

## 4. Use a Keyboard and Mouse

If you have a keyboard and mouse that is compatible with your Fire TV, you can use them to navigate to the link and click on it. This will require you to connect the keyboard and mouse to your Fire TV, which can be done using a USB hub or Bluetooth connection.

## 5. Use a Screen Mirroring App

Finally, you can use a screen mirroring app, such as AirScreen, to mirror your smartphone or tablet screen onto your Fire TV. This will allow you to navigate to the link on your mobile device and click on it, and it will be mirrored onto your Fire TV screen. Once you've installed the screen mirroring app, simply follow the instructions to connect your device to your Fire TV.

In conclusion, there are several ways to open browser links on your Amazon Fire TV without having to resort to desperate measures. By using a third-party browser app, a shortcut app, another device with the Amazon Silk Browser, a keyboard and mouse, or a screen mirroring app, you can easily access the content you need. Give these fixes a try and start browsing the web on your Fire TV today!
