## Chosen Solution
 how do i change the 'minimum requirements' so I can download my QBs

 @suziq sorry but if your computer does not meet the minimum requirements there is no fix. You have to at least tell us what model computer you have, the specs of the one you have and then tell us what requirements you need to download your QB's

 Yep, he's right. The minimum specs is the least amount of hardware capable of running an application, in simple terms. I guess if you want to change minimum spec you will have to buy new hardware, or a new laptop.
P.S. To build a new computer is to save hundreds over a pre-built computer.
