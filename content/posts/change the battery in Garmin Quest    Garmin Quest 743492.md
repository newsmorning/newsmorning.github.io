Introduction

Garmin Quest is one of the most popular GPS navigation devices among motorists. It is an all-purpose device designed to help you navigate, track, and plan routes. However, many owners of the Garmin Quest device are unaware of the importance of replacing the battery. In this article, we will discuss the shocking truth about why you should change your Garmin Quest battery immediately.

Why Replace Your Garmin Quest Battery?

Your Garmin Quest battery is the lifeblood of your device. Without it, your GPS cannot function as it needs to. The battery powers the device, and over time it can start to wear out. When this happens, you will notice that your GPS is not holding a charge as long as it used to, and the battery may die while you are using it.

One of the critical reasons to change your Garmin Quest battery is safety. A faulty battery can lead to your GPS suddenly shutting down in the middle of driving, causing accidents. A dead battery can also make it harder for rescue teams to locate you in case of an emergency.

Another critical aspect is the lifespan of the device and how often you plan on using your GPS. If you use your GPS regularly, the battery may not last as long as you think. It can start to wear down faster, making it challenging to keep the Garmin Quest functioning for a long period.

Finally, the battery can also affect the accuracy of the GPS device. The battery works in concert with the sensors located within the device. If the battery is low or not working correctly, the GPS device will not function as accurately as it should, leading you astray.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you are an owner of a Garmin Quest device, you must replace the battery as soon as you notice signs of wear or malfunction. Ignoring the battery may lead to safety hazards or inaccurate readings, causing you to get lost while driving. By replacing the battery, you can ensure that your GPS device is working correctly, and you can drive with confidence.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Quest since it came out - and LOVE it. Has anyone successfully replaced the internal battery?
Mine is ok at the moment, but I dread the thought it may die and ..what then? Still does 12 hours of GPSing - great on the Motorbike, no wires needed
All the new ones only do 5 hrs when new :(

 This is the only thing I found on it, looks like it's possible but you can't get a battery specifically for it.

 Battery available from Battery.net approx $15.00.  Unscrew metal threads and split case. Unplug battery remove and reglue the replacement battary back in as it was fitted by Garmin.  Great unit and mine is on of the first as well.  Now leave and use it on my Burgman 650 Maxi Schooter.  Just purchased a Garmin 2460LT ($320 Aus) and I think this is better than the Quest was in it's day but not as clear in daylight conditions as the Quest.  To easy.   Regards Ross
