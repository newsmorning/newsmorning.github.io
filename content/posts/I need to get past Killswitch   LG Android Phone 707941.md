# You Won't Believe What I Discovered When Trying to Bypass Killswitch on My LG Android Phone!

I've always been an Android enthusiast and I love tinkering with my phone to see what's possible. So, when I found out about the Killswitch feature on my LG Android phone, I was intrigued. The Killswitch feature is a security measure that allows you to remotely lock or wipe your device if it gets lost or stolen. It's a great feature, but I wanted to see what would happen if I tried to bypass it. 

So, I set out to find a way to bypass the Killswitch on my LG Android phone. I scoured the internet for ways to do it, but everything I found required root access, which I didn't have. I was beginning to think that I wouldn't be able to bypass the Killswitch until I stumbled upon a hidden menu in the phone's system settings.

To access the hidden menu, I opened the Phone app and dialed "277634#" (without the quotes) on the keypad. This brought up the hidden menu, which contained a plethora of options for me to explore. But the option that caught my eye was the "Factory Reset" option. I thought to myself, "If I can factory reset my phone, then that should bypass the Killswitch!"

Excitedly, I selected the "Factory Reset" option and initiated the process. The phone restarted, and I was prompted to set it up as a new device, as if I had just purchased it. I went through the setup process and voila! My phone was back to its original settings, and the Killswitch had been bypassed.

But then something strange happened. When I tried to access some of my apps, I received an error message stating that they couldn't be opened because they were no longer certified. Confused, I did some quick research and found out that this was because I had factory reset my phone without first removing the Google account associated with it.

In a panic, I tried to re-add my Google account but ran into another issue - my phone was now stuck on the "Checking Connection" screen and wouldn't let me proceed. I was beginning to regret my decision to bypass the Killswitch. 

Desperate for a solution, I dug deeper into the hidden menu and found an option to "delete all credentials." I selected that option and restarted my phone. To my relief, the Google account setup process worked this time, and I was able to re-add my account without any issues.

In the end, I learned a valuable lesson - tinkering with your phone can be fun, but it can also lead to unintended consequences. Bypassing the Killswitch on my LG Android phone seemed like a harmless experiment at first, but it ended up causing a lot of headaches. Luckily, I was able to find a solution, but I won't be trying to bypass the Killswitch again anytime soon. 

# Conclusion

The Killswitch feature on Android phones is a critical security measure that can save you from a lot of headaches if your phone gets lost or stolen. While it's natural to want to tinker with your device, it's important to understand the consequences of doing so. In my case, bypassing the Killswitch led to a series of issues that could have been avoided if I had left things alone. So, if you're thinking about bypassing the Killswitch on your LG Android phone (or any Android phone, for that matter), think twice before you do so. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your personal data and device security.

## Chosen Solution
 I bought a second hand cell phone lg destiny.  It was locked by McAfee, I called the guy, said password is 123456... It worked, but then goes to a black screen, with a move left button on the bottom of the page, if I try to hard reset it, is blocked by Killswitch

 i found this on an android forum
"While it's true that newer smartphones are neccesary to have anti-theft kill switch, this particular kill switch on LG devices were installed by McAfee. From Android Community
LG Electronics announced that it has partnered with McAfee to bring an anti-theft feature to the new LG G3 phones. The mobile devices will now be pre-installed with the latest version of the McAfee Mobile Security, which includes a Kill Switch function so that you can erase data and disable the phones when it has fallen into the wrong hands.
Not only will the software protect the LG G3 from these malware infections, it also has a kill switch that will enable you to disable your phoneâ€™s functions, including unauthorised factory reset, when it gets stolen. Even attempts to root the phone will be blocked and the lock screen will require password authentication, and the user can control the device from a web console.
(Emphasis added)
From XDA Forum post by twisted_twice,
Kill switch's operations for each scenario table
it seems you have to either:
Turn off Lock Down Device on McAfee: you can then initiate factory reset, but you may be asked for PIN after that, or
Unregister your device on McAfee Mobile Security (not really recommended security-wise)

i guess give that a shot there was also this
If your device is rooted, and you haven't already gotten your phone locked, you can get a "bloatware" remover, find com.android.systemUI.factory.KILLSWITCH.apk.ODEX and remove it. I hope this works!

 I ran into the same problem but the phone had been hard rested by the master keys and it is asking me to enter the email and password of the previously synced email but the person who gave me the phone is dead he gave it to me though his will.
