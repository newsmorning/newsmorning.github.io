# Rugged 5414: One Simple Hack to Fix Your Damaged Screw Head and Save Your Laptop!

As a laptop user, it’s not uncommon to run into issues that require opening up the device. Whether it’s replacing a part or upgrading a component, accessing the internals of your laptop is often necessary. However, a common issue that arises when trying to open up laptops is the dreaded stripped or damaged screw head. It’s frustrating and can potentially ruin your device if dealt with improperly. 

Thankfully, Rugged 5414, a company specializing in tool and gear solutions, has come up with a simple hack to fix damaged screw heads that you can easily do at home. Here’s how it works.

First, you’ll need to acquire the Rugged 5414 Screw Extraction Tool. This tool is specifically designed to remove damaged screws without causing further damage to the device.

Once you have the tool, insert it into the damaged screw head and turn it counter-clockwise. The Rugged 5414 Screw Extraction Tool works by providing a grip that allows you to turn the screw in the opposite direction despite the damage.

The best part is that the extraction tool doesn’t require much force, so there’s less of a risk of damaging other components of your laptop. Plus, it’s designed to fit into tight spaces, so you can use it on screws located in hard-to-reach places.

By using the Rugged 5414 Screw Extraction Tool, you can save yourself from having to replace an entire component or even worse, having to buy an entirely new laptop, just because a stripped screw head caused irreversible damage.

Moreover, Rugged 5414’s screw extraction tool isn’t just for laptops. You can also use it on other devices like cameras, smartphones, and even car engines.

In conclusion, running into a damaged screw head can feel like a setback, but with Rugged 5414’s screw extraction tool, it doesn’t have to be. The tool is affordable, easy to use, and can save you from potentially costly repairs or replacements. So, if you’re a laptop user or just someone who works with a lot of screws, consider getting the Rugged 5414 Screw Extraction Tool and never fear stripped screwheads again!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello.
I was trying to remove the back cover on my Dell Latitude Rugged 5414 to upgrade the Ram, but two of the screws are too tight and stripped their heads. Can anyone give me some advice to house those screws and remove them? Could you use WD40 or a similar product?


Thanks.

 Hi @yerbito ,
Maybe try using a screw extractor to remove the screws.
Here’s a link that describes how to use them
Here’s a link to the ifixit  Precision Screw Extractor Set
Here’s the owner manual that may help once you have it open. It describes the necessary pre-requisite steps and procedures to remove/replace most of the components in the laptop.
I would never pour/squirt etc any liquids into an electronic device especially if it still had power connected i.e. battery, as you don’t know what damage it may cause. All liquids conduct electricity to a certain degree (except distilled water) and these can create circuit paths between the components that weren’t in the operating design and could damage them.
There is always power on the motherboard in a laptop even when it is switched off. The Power On/Off switch is not a power isolating switch. Its function is to signal the intentions of the user. Think of the laptop as being in an extremely low power state when off and not completely isolated from any power. Even if you removed the battery first (which you should do anyway) there is still a chance of causing corrosion due to the chemical reaction between the liquid and the different metals found on the motherboard. My opinion is that it’s not worth the risk

 This is not a solution but how to avoid this problem in the first place.
Always look at the object for a minute or two BEFORE actually doing anything.Use correct type and size screwdriver.Support the work so it does not move or shift unexpectedly while turning the screwdriver.Watch carefully what you are doing and take your time.  No rushing.  If getting tense pause and take a deep breath.Apply sufficient pressure so that the the screwdriver does not slide out of the screw head while turning thus damaging the screw head.  Too much pressure could damage the case, etc.
This comes with experience. In my early days I also had this problem occur until I learnt the above steps.

 The corner screws on Latitude 5414 are VERY hard to get out. One would think Dell used an impact wrench to tighten them. Same happened to me. Had to drill off the heads.
