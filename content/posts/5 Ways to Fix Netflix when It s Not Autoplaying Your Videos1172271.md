# Is Your Netflix Acting Up? Here Are 5 Genius Hacks to Get Auto-Play Back ASAP!

As a Netflix user, there's nothing more frustrating than settling down to stream your favorite show, only to realize that the auto-play feature is no longer working. If you're experiencing this issue, don't panic - there are several easy hacks you can try to restore auto-play back to normal. In this article, we'll explore five genius hacks to get auto-play back on track.

## 1. Clear Your Browser Cache

Sometimes, browser cookies and cache can cause issues with Netflix's auto-play functionality. To fix this problem, clear your browser's cache and cookies by navigating to the settings menu, selecting the "Privacy and Security" option, and clearing your browsing data. Once you've completed this step, try playing a Netflix show again to see if the auto-play function has been restored.

## 2. Check Your Account Settings

Netflix's account settings can be a treasure trove of information when it comes to troubleshooting issues with auto-play. Visit your account settings page and ensure that both the "Play next episode automatically" and "Autoplay previews while browsing on all devices" options are turned on. If either of these options is turned off, toggle them on and try streaming again to see if it works.

## 3. Use a Different Browser or Device

While Netflix works with most web browsers and devices, there may be compatibility issues that cause the auto-play feature to malfunction. If you've been using the same device or browser to stream Netflix, it might be worth trying a different one to see if that fixes the issue. For example, if you're currently using Chrome, try switching to Firefox or Edge to see if that resolves the problem.

## 4. Update Your Browser

Outdated browsers can cause issues with streaming platforms like Netflix, so it's important to ensure that your browser is up to date. Visit your browser's settings menu and check for any available updates. Once you've updated your browser, retry streaming on Netflix to see if the auto-play function has been restored.

## 5. Contact Netflix Support

If none of these hacks have worked for you, it's time to reach out to Netflix Support. You can contact them through their website or via the Netflix app, and their customer service team should be able to assist you in resolving the issue. They may ask for additional information or troubleshooting steps, so be prepared to provide them with details about your setup and the problem you're experiencing.

In conclusion, experiencing issues with Netflix's auto-play function can be frustrating, but there are several hacks you can try to restore it back to normal. Clearing your browser cache, checking your account settings, using a different browser or device, updating your browser, and contacting Netflix support are all viable solutions to try. Following these hacks will help you get back to streaming your favorite shows in no time.
