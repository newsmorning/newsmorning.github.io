Revive Your Graphics Card: Discover 3 Quick Tricks to Reset Your Graphics Driver Now!

Having a graphics card in your PC or laptop is critical for displaying images, videos, and games. But, graphics cards can also crash, malfunction, or fail for various reasons, resulting in distorted images, error messages, or the infamous Blue Screen of Death. 

One of the most common solutions for graphics card issues is to reset your graphics driver. A graphics driver is software that enables communication between your operating system and graphics card, ensuring that your display runs smoothly. If your driver is outdated, corrupted, or not installed correctly, your graphics card may not function correctly. Luckily, resetting your graphics driver is not rocket science and can be done in a few easy steps. 

In this article, we will share three quick and straightforward tricks to revive your graphics card by resetting your graphics driver.

Trick #1: Update Your Graphics Driver 

The first method to reset your graphics driver is to update it to the latest version. Newer drivers usually fix bugs, improve the graphics card's performance, and come with feature enhancements. Here are the steps to update your graphics driver. 

1. Press Win + X keys on your keyboard and select "Device Manager." 
2. Locate "Display adapters" and expand it. 
3. Right-click on your graphics card and select "Update driver." 
4. Choose "Search automatically for updated driver software." 
5. Wait for your computer to download and install the latest driver. 

Trick #2: Roll Back Your Graphics Driver 

If updating your graphics driver doesn't solve the problem, you can try rolling back the driver to its previous version. This method is useful if the latest driver version introduced new issues or if your graphics card worked correctly before a recent update. Here are the steps to roll back your graphics driver. 

1. Open the Device Manager as described above. 
2. Locate "Display adapters" and expand it. 
3. Right-click on your graphics card and select "Properties." 
4. Click on the "Driver" tab, and select "Roll Back Driver." 
5. Follow the prompts to roll back your driver. 

Trick #3: Uninstall and Reinstall Your Graphics Driver 

If both updating and rolling back your graphics driver don't work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the driver. This method is more radical as it requires removing the driver entirely and deleting all its files. However, it can fix driver conflicts, corruption, or other issues that affect your graphics card. Here are the steps to uninstall and reinstall your graphics driver. 

1. Open the Device Manager as described above. 
2. Locate "Display adapters" and expand it. 
3. Right-click on your graphics card and select "Uninstall device." 
4. Confirm the action, and your computer will remove the driver. 
5. Visit your graphics card manufacturer's website and download the latest driver for your model. 
6. Install the driver following the prompts. 

In conclusion, resetting your graphics driver can help fix various problems affecting the performance of your graphics card. By following these three quick and easy tricks, you can revive your graphics card and enjoy clear, crisp, and visually stunning visuals again. If you are still encountering graphics card problems after trying these methods, you may need to seek further assistance from a technician or your graphics card manufacturer.

If you’re experiencing a black, flickering, or frozen screen, the issue may derive from your graphics driver. If your Windows PC doesn’t detect and fix the problem, here’s how to reset your graphics driver manually.

 
This tutorial will explain what a graphics driver is and how you can reset it on Windows 10 and 11.

 
## What is a Graphics Driver, and Why Should You Reset It?

 
A graphics driver is software that enables your graphics card to interact with your display monitor. In other words, it converts the digital code from your graphics card into the visual display you see on your screen. These exist for all major GPU manufacturers, including AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel.

 

 
Like all software, your graphics driver may experience a glitch and begin malfunctioning. This can result in your display flickering, stuttering, freezing, or going entirely black. In this case, resetting your graphics driver is often enough to solve the issue and get everything working.

 
## 1. How to Restart Graphics Drivers the Quick Way

 
To reset your graphics driver quickly, you can press the Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B. Your screen will briefly go black, and you will hear a beep, then it will return to normal.

 
The actual effect of this keyboard shortcut is unclear, but it is thought to queue telemetry data to send to Windows about a black screen error that the user has experienced. The side effect is that it causes your graphics driver to reset.

 
## 2. How to Reset Graphics Drivers the Foolproof Way

 
While the above shortcut is great in a pinch, it may not always reset your graphics driver. Here’s the proper way to reset your graphics driver:

 
- Right-click the Start menu and select Device Manager. Alternatively, press the Win + R keys, type “devmgmt.msc,” and press Enter.

 
- In the left-hand menu under “Display adapters,” right-click your graphics card and click Disable device.

 
- In the pop-up window, select Yes.

 
- Right-click it one more time and click Enable device.

 
After a few seconds, your driver should reset, and all driver issues should be resolved. If not, proceed to the next step.

 
## 3. How to Reinstall Your Graphics Drivers

 
If simply resetting your graphics driver was unsuccessful, you can troubleshoot the issue by completely reinstalling your driver software. The process is the same regardless of which GPU you have (for instance, if you have an NVIDIA graphics card, there’s no need to use the NVIDIA Control Panel).

 
To reinstall your video drivers:

 
- Open Device Manager as above.
 - In the left-hand menu under “Display adapters,” right-click your graphics card and click Uninstall device.

 
- Now shut down and reboot your PC to finalize the installation. During startup, Microsoft will automatically reinstall your graphics card driver.
 - Next, ensure the display driver is up-to-date by opening Device Manager, clicking Display adapters, right-clicking your graphics driver, and selecting Update driver.

 
## What Should You Do If the Problem Persists?

 
Hopefully, this guide has fixed your display issues. However, if Windows 10 or 11 keeps freezing up after reinstalling your driver software, there may be a deeper problem. Try these troubleshooting steps to discover and fix the issue.
