Is the Nexus 6 Possessed? Replacement Microphones Vanished Without a Trace!

The Nexus 6 has been one of the more popular devices released by Google. However, there have been reports of strange incidents happening with the device. One of which is the vanishing of replacement microphones.

A few Nexus 6 owners have reported that they ordered replacement microphones online, but they never received them. Some have even tried contacting customer support, but no one seems to have an answer as to why their orders were never received. This raises the question: is the Nexus 6 possessed?

One possible explanation is that the devices themselves are at fault. It is possible that the microphones are not compatible with the device, causing them to be rejected or disappear entirely. Another theory is that a bug or glitch in the system may be causing the issue.

Despite these speculations, there has been no confirmation as to the cause of the missing microphones. Google has not released any official statement on the matter, leaving users to wonder if they will ever have their replacement items.

As a Nexus 6 owner, it can be frustrating to deal with technical difficulties such as this. However, it is important to remember that technology is not perfect, and issues like this can arise unexpectedly. In situations like this, patience and persistence are key. It may take some time to resolve the issue, but keep in mind that customer support and various online forums are always available to provide solutions.

In conclusion, the mystery of the vanished Nexus 6 replacement microphones remains unsolved. However, it is important to remain hopeful and remember that the Nexus 6 is still a great device, despite its minor faults. As technology continues to evolve, it is inevitable that devices will run into issues, but with time and effort, solutions can always be found.

## Chosen Solution
 This device needs all three mics on the bottom near the charge port but I’m having trouble finding replacement parts. Does anyone have the numbers off these mics?

 You can buy this phone on eBay that’s broken and chances are that these mics still work.
