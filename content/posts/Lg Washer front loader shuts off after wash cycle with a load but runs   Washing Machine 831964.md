Title: Is Your LG Front Loader Washer Broken? Shocking Reason It Shuts Off After Wash Cycle Revealed!

Introduction:
If you own an LG front loader washer, you may have experienced a frustrating situation where it shuts off after the washing cycle or during the rinse cycle. This issue, though common, can leave you scratching your head wondering what the problem might be. In this article, we will discuss the shocking reason why your LG front loader washer shuts off after a wash cycle.

Section 1: What Is An LG Front Loader Washer?
Before delving into the problem, it is vital to understand what an LG front loader washer is. This kind of washer operates by loading clothes through a door at the front of the machine. It uses less water and detergent compared to top loader washers, making it energy efficient.

Section 2: The Common Issue 
The shocking reason your LG front loader washer shuts off after a wash cycle is due to the accumulation of water in the drum. When you finish washing the clothes, the remaining water in the drum can gain access to the control board of the machine, causing it to shut off as a safety measure. This is a sign that there's a problem with the machine and needs to be checked for safety reasons.

Section 3: How To Fix The Issue 
If there's water accumulated in the drum, you need to drain it first before proceeding to solve the issue. Here are a few things you can do to fix the issue:

1. Manually drain the water from the drum using the drain hose at the bottom of the machine.
2. Clean the lint filter to ensure that the water flows out smoothly without blockages.
3. Check the pressure sensor that determines the water level in the machine. If it's faulty, it can cause the water to overflow in the drum, leading to the shut off.

Section 4: Prevention Of The Issue
As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. Here are a few things you can do to prevent the issue from happening again:

1. Always clean the lint filter before starting a wash cycle.
2. Use the right amount of detergent and water as specified in the owner's manual.
3. Avoid overloading the machine. Divide laundry into smaller loads to ensure that there's enough space in the drum for water to circulate.
4. Always leave the door of the machine open after use to allow air to circulate and prevent mold growth. 

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the shocking reason your LG front loader washer shuts off after a wash cycle is due to accumulated water in the drum. This issue can be solved by draining the water, cleaning the lint filter or checking the pressure sensor. Prevention can also go a long way in ensuring that it doesn't occur again. By following the preventive measures listed above, you can ensure the longevity of your LG front loader washer.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a lg tromm which is a front load washer. This washer appears to not have a belt. The washer fills up and begins wash cycle. About 10-15 of spinning for wash cycle it just shuts off. No codes flash nothing. I believe the machine is ready to stop and drain the water for the next cycle. I can run the machine empty and it cycles through all the cycles wash, drain, rinse, spin. But when i put a load in it it shuts off after the wash cycle is complete

 My guess is that the control board or the motor is failing under load. Most of the Asian brands have everything built into one big control board. The motor can be tested for balanced windings, but the boards are filled with silicone goop so component level testing and repair is impossible. As long as the rotating basket isn't binding up, the load sensing and motor control is part of the control board. There are parts houses that will refund your money if a replacement part doesn't fix your problem.
