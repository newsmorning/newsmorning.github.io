Phablets are something we’d all love to have and hold, yet getting one at a competitive price is not an everyday occasion. If you missed last year’s Note 4, and are in dire need to get something close it, there’s a much better deal you can fall for – the Infinix Note 5. Like you should already know, it comes with a pure Android Oreo in Android One; a metallic unibody that makes it more premium; a stylus pen on the pro-version; as well as some new cool features.
 
The Note 5 sees an implementation of AI scene detection in its camera, meant to help users take better shorts depending on the scenery, especially while on the outside. You will also experience AI-induced bokeh effects especially when taking selfies. This means there is a Face ID somewhere, as well as great camera features within.
 
Infinix Note 5 will also support Google Lens – a new way to search what you see and interact with the world around you.
