# Get Ready to be Hooked on the Hilarious New Indie Game Everyone's Talking About - Pit People from The Behemoth, Now Available for Windows 10 and Xbox One!

Gamers, are you ready to be hooked on a game that will make you laugh and want to keep playing for hours? Look no further than Pit People from The Behemoth, the indie game developer known for their hit games Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater. Pit People is available now for Windows 10 and Xbox One, and it is sure to become your newest gaming addiction.

The Behemoth is known for their quirky humor and engaging gameplay, and Pit People is no exception. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a major calamity has caused massive destruction and devastation. Players take on the role of a nameless blueberry farmer whose town is destroyed by a giant bear. The farmer's wife and son are abducted, and the farmer sets out on a quest to rescue them.

To help you on your quest, you'll recruit a troupe of diverse and eccentric characters, ranging from a pyromaniac cupcake to a space bear in a flying saucer. Each character has its own unique abilities and strengths, and you'll need to plan your battles strategically to defeat your enemies.

The gameplay is turn-based, with battles taking place on hexagonal tiles. You'll need to move your characters strategically around the map to avoid enemy attacks and take down your opponents. Along the way, you'll collect loot, level up your characters, and discover new areas to explore.

But what really makes Pit People shine is its hilarious story and entertaining characters. You'll encounter a wide range of personalities, each with their own unique quirks and traits. The game's dialogue is brilliant, filled with witty one-liners and zany humor that will keep you laughing from start to finish.

The game's hand-drawn art style is also a standout feature. The colorful, cartoonish graphics are a perfect fit for the game's offbeat humor and quirky atmosphere. The game's soundtrack, composed by The Behemoth's in-house composer, is also top-notch.

Pit People is a fantastic addition to The Behemoth's impressive catalog of games. It's a game that's easy to jump into, but difficult to put down. Whether you're a fan of turn-based strategy games or just looking for a fun and entertaining story, Pit People is a game that you won't want to miss. It's available now on Windows 10 and Xbox One, so get ready to be hooked!
