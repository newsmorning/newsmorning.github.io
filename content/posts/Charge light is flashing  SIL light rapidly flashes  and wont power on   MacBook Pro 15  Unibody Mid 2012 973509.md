Now that we know the possible reasons for your MacBook Pro 15 issues let's dive into the solution.

## How to Revive Your MacBook Pro 15

Before you start panicking and thinking about buying a new MacBook Pro, consider the following possible solutions.

### 1. Check the Charger

Ensure that the charger is correctly plugged in and working before attempting anything else. Try charging the device for about 10-15 minutes before turning it on. If this doesn't work, consider purchasing an alternate charger or battery.

### 2. Safe Boot

A Safe Boot is a Mac feature that loads a minimum amount of drivers and software, hence potentially mitigating any issues. To perform a Safe Boot, follow these steps:

* Shut down your MacBook Pro 15.
* Power on the device and then hold down the Shift key until the Apple logo displays.
* Release the Shift key and then let the macOS load completely.
* Restart your device.

### 3. Reset the Controller

Resetting the Controller can help you fix the issue if the MacBook Pro 15 isn't responding. To reset the Controller, follow these steps:

* Unplug the charger and shut down your MacBook Pro 15.
* Locate and press the Shift + Control + Option keys on the left side of the device keyboard, in addition to pressing the Power button simultaneously.
* Hold down these keys for 10 seconds and then release them.
* Reconnect the charger and power on your device.

### 4. Seek Professional Help

If none of the above steps work or if you're experiencing additional issues, consider seeking professional help. Apple Stores, Genius Bars or Authorized Service Providers can help diagnose the issue and provide a potential fix.

## Conclusion

The above steps should help you revive your MacBook Pro 15. However, in case other serious damage or issues are detected, keep in mind that Apple offers technical support through their online resources, by phone, email or scheduling an appointment at one of their stores. Don't panic, it's always worth exploring your options before giving up on your device altogether.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Macbook Pro that has a flashing charge light, and a rapidly flashing sleep indicator light. The charge light flashes green for a second then turns off again. I have gotten into the CPU to reset the RAm to no avail, and no combination of button presses will force turn the computer on
