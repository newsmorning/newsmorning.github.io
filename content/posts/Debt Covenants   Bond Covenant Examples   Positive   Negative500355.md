Introduction:

Bonds are widely used as a way of raising capital for businesses. However, the use of bonds comes with some strings attached, which are commonly referred to as debt covenants. Debt covenants are provisions in a bond agreement that restrict the actions of the issuer, in order to protect the interests of the investors. While debt covenants can be a useful tool, they can also have a negative effect on the issuer's finances. In this article, we will explore the positives and negatives of bond covenants through examples.

Negative Bond Covenant Example:

One of the most common debt covenants is the negative covenant. A negative covenant prohibits the issuer from taking certain actions that could affect the bondholders negatively. For example, a negative covenant may prohibit the issuer from selling assets that are critical to the business operations. Another example is prohibiting the issuer from issuing additional debt. These covenants are intended to protect the bondholders from any actions that might impact the issuer's ability to make timely payments to its investors.

The negative covenants can be detrimental to the issuer's finances, as they limit its ability to make important strategic decisions. A negative covenant that prohibits the issuer from selling assets can prevent the company from reducing its debt levels or raising capital. Furthermore, if the issuer is prohibited from issuing additional debt, it may be forced to rely on equity financing, which could dilute shareholder value.

Positive Bond Covenant Example:

Positive covenants are not as common as negative covenants. However, they focus on the actions that the issuer must take to protect the interests of the bondholders. A positive covenant may require the issuer to maintain certain financial ratios or provide regular financial statements to the bondholders. It could also require the issuer to maintain insurance coverage or provide evidence of compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Positive covenants protect the bondholders' interests by ensuring that the issuer's financial performance is stable and predictable. This is particularly important if the bondholders have invested in bonds that have lower credit ratings. In other words, positive covenants may provide reassurance to investors that they are likely to receive their payments on time.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, it is clear that debt covenants can have both positive and negative effects on the issuer’s finances. Negative covenants can limit the issuer's ability to make important strategic decisions, while positive covenants can provide reassurance to investors that they are likely to receive timely payments. Therefore, it is necessary for issuers to strike a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of debt covenants. Careful consideration of covenants should be taken before issuing a bond as it can affect the finances of the issuer.

## What are Debt Covenants?
 
Debt covenants are formal agreements or promises that are made between different parties like creditors, suppliers, vendors, shareholders, investors, etc and a company that states the limits for financial ratios such as leverage ratios, working capital ratios, dividend payout ratios, etc which a debtor must refrain from breaching.
 
Ideally, when the lenders lend the money to the borrowers, they sign an agreement. And under this agreement, the borrowers have to maintain certain restrictions so that the interest of the lenders is protected.

### Why are debt covenants necessary?
 
In other words, why would bond covenant lenders restrict the borrowers from doing something? The bond covenant lenders don’t want to pressurize the borrowers with rules and restrictions. However, if they don’t bind the borrowers with few terms & conditions, they may not get their money back.
 
It is also important to note that debt covenants also help the borrowers (yes, even after being restricted). When the agreement between the borrowers and the lenders is signed, the terms & conditions are discussed. And if the borrowers abide by the terms, they may need to pay a lower interest rate (cost of the borrowing) to the lenders.

### Debt Covenants Example
 
Let’s say that Icebreaker Co. has taken debt from a bank. The bank has offered the company a $1 million loan stating that until the company pays off the bank the principal plus a 10% interest, the company won’t be able to take any additional loan from the market.
 
The restriction imposed by the bank on Icebreaker Co. would be called a bond covenant. But why would the bank do such a thing? Let’s analyze it.
 
- First of all, the bank would do its own due diligence before lending the amount to the Icebreaker Co.If the bank finds that Icebreaker Co. doesn’t have a good risk-profile, lending a big amount would be risky too for the bank. In this case, if the company goes out and also borrows a million here and another million there and goes belly up, the bank will not get back its money.Thinking about the future risk, the bank may restrict the company from borrowing any additional loan until the loan of the bank is being paid off in full.

 
### Bond Covenants Metrics
 
How do the lenders get to know what bond covenants they need to impose upon the borrower? Here are some metrics that the lenders/borrowers need to look at before imposing bond covenants.
 
- Total assets: A company that has good enough AUM (Assets under Management) would have good financial health (at least on the surface). To know whether a company can pay off its debts, the lenders need to look at the next ratio.

 
- Debt / Assets: This is a simple ratio that every lender needs to look at before lending any money to the borrower. This ratio helps the investor understand whether the company has enough assets to pay off the debts. For example, if they have lower total assets than debts, the company has a big problem. Or else if the company has a pretty lower debt (i.e., 10% of total assets), the company may be playing too safe.
