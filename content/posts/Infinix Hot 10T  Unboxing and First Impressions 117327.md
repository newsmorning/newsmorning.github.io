Are you a serious gamer who's always on the lookout for the latest and greatest gaming smartphone to take your gaming experience to the next level? Then, you're in for a treat! In today's article, we'll be taking a closer look at the Infinix Hot 10T – one of the newest and most exciting gaming smartphones on the market. 
And trust us, we're not exaggerating when we say that this might just be the ultimate gaming beast that you've been dreaming of!

## The Epic Unboxing 

Before we get into our first impressions and actual user experience, let's first take a moment to appreciate the unboxing of the Infinix Hot 10T. The unboxing experience was truly epic and worth capturing on camera. We went through the traditional unboxing ritual of removing the protective plastic wrap from the box and then carefully opening the package.

Upon opening the box, we were greeted with a visually-appealing package that contained the Infinix Hot 10T smartphone, a power adapter, a USB cable, a user manual, and a protective case. The protective case was a nice touch, as it protected the phone from scratches and accidental drops.

The smartphone itself had a sleek and modern design that was very visually pleasing. It had a smooth finish and was comfortable to hold, despite being slightly heavy. We could already feel the power emanating from the phone, and we couldn't wait to get started with our gaming experience.

## Mind-Blowing First Impressions 

Our first impressions of the Infinix Hot 10T were simply mind-blowing. The phone came equipped with a 6.82-inch display that provided an immersive and breathtaking viewing experience. The 90Hz refresh rate made animations smoother and more fluid, and the HD+ resolution ensured that the graphics were crisp and clear.

But that's not all. The phone was powered by a powerful Helio G70 processor that was optimized for gaming. We could feel the difference in performance as we opened multiple apps and games simultaneously without experiencing any lag or slowdown. This was further supported by the 4GB RAM and 128GB storage capacity which allowed us to install our favorite apps and games easily.

The Infinix Hot 10T also had an impressive battery life that lasted us a full day of heavy use. We didn't need to worry about recharging the phone frequently, which was a relief during long gaming sessions.

One of the most standout features of the Infinix Hot 10T is its gaming-specific software optimizations. The Game Mode feature allowed us to optimize the phone's performance for gaming and even doubled as a dedicated gaming assistant. The Smart Turbo feature also provided an additional layer of optimization by clearing memory and boosting performance when needed. These features allowed us to take our gaming experience to the next level by optimizing every aspect of the phone for gaming.

Finally, the phone came with an impressive camera setup that produced stunning photos and videos, even in low-light situations. This ensured that we could capture and share our gaming moments with friends and family seamlessly.

## Conclusion 

The Infinix Hot 10T is undoubtedly one of the best gaming smartphones on the market, and our experience with it only reinforces that belief. From the epic unboxing experience to the mind-blowing first impressions, we were thoroughly impressed with this beast of a phone. Its powerful performance, impressive battery life, gaming-specific optimizations, and stunning camera setup make it the perfect phone for gamers who want to take their gaming experience to the next level.

Infinix Hot 10T was officially made available in Kenya late last week and in this smartphone season, it is easy for such devices, especially those in Tecno and Infinix’s lower-tier to go under the radar, unnoticed.
 
This device comes to join the Hot 10 family of devices, which in turn comes to succeed the Hot 9 devices and the Hot 8 before that. The Infinix Hot 10T comes with a bunch of new and some upgraded features which make it unique in the budget segment of the market. 
 
We bought the Infinix Hot 10T on launch-day and I have been using it ever since and here’s my unboxing and initial impressions.
 
The box is typical Infinix with bold colors and branding and in it, you get the following.
 
- 1 x Infinix Hot 10T1 x 10W power brick and 1 x micro-USB charging cable1 x Sim injector toola plastic casea flimsy screen protector

 
The design of the Infinix Hot 10T is very thoughtful and sleek but still very ‘traditional’.  The device is primarily made of plastic (obviously), and has an interesting pattern on the back which should help with grip. I have only been using it with the case on so I can’t really talk on the effectiveness.
 
A quick walk around the device, the left hand side houses the SIM tray which holds two SIM cards and an SD Card. The bottom features a headphone jack, a micro-USB port, and a speaker grille while the right side has the volume rockers and the power/lock button.
 
The 6.8’’ Dot Display is large enough to cater to all your multimedia needs including watching music videos, streaming movies or music but the 720p display gave a lower pixel density than  I would like.
 
Infinix Hot 10T also has Bluetooth Audio share 2.0, and Dirac Stereo Sound Effect.
 
Infinix Hot 10T has a 90Hz refresh rate so you not only enjoy scrolling the web or social media but also playing your favorite games. This is my first encounter with 90Hz and I didn’t really feel the difference between 90Hz and regular 60Hz.
 
It has a back fingerprint sensor and face unlock at the front for bio-authentication, both are pretty fast but you might want to tame your expectations on the face unlock’s security.
 
The Infinix Hot 10T has a square-shaped camera sensor at the back but only has 3 sensors with a blank slot in the array. The flash is housed in a separate location just below the square.
 
On the software side, the Infinix Hot 10T runs Android 11-based XOS 7.6 Dolphin out of the box. 
 

 
On top of most of the Android 11 features, Infinix added software enhancements and customization features with XOS 7.6 such as this side panel you scroll over to get tools like the screenshot feature or apps for easy multi-app switching.
 
Running the show is the Helio G70 processor and a Mali G52 GPU coupled with 4GB of RAM and 128GB/4GB of RAM and 128GB onboard storage. I have the 4+64GB variant and most of my daily tasks are handled with no fuss.
 
For the photography enthusiasts, the Infinix Hot 10T comes with a 64MP main sensor, a 2MP depth sensor and an AI camera. Selfies and face unlock is done with a 8MP teardrop camera sensor.
 
There are a bunch of built-in modes that we shall highlight more in our full review so stay tuned for that. You can shoot video at 720p,1080p and 2K at 30fps.
 
For me, the star of the show is the 5000mAh battery. I had the device set to 90Hz full time and still, I was able to last about a day and a half of normal usage and Hotspot tethering before the device gave out. I regularly got 8-9 hours of screen-on-time, a first for me in a long time.
 
Sadly though, the micro-USB charging maxes out at 10W, at least with the included charging brick. Considering that this is a massive 5000mAh cell, this took ages, at least for someone like me coming from 33W super-fast charging on Samsung Galaxy A70.
 
## Pricing and Availability
 
Infinix Hot 10T is available in retail stores across the country at KES 15,500 for 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, while 4GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage goes for KES 17,500.
 
Knowing Kenyan stores, this price might be inflated slightly or you might get a discount depending on where you choose to purchase your device. 
 
We’re working on the full review so be on the lookout for that sometime soon.
