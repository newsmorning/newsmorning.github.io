# DISASTER! I Connected My Behringer Vmx200 Mixer to the WRONG Voltage - You Won't Believe What Happened Next!

Have you ever made a mistake you wish you could take back? That's what happened to me recently when I tried to use my Behringer Vmx200 Mixer with the wrong voltage. The results were not pretty.

The Behringer Vmx200 Mixer is a powerful piece of audio equipment that allows you to mix music, vocals, and other audio sources. It's a must-have for any DJ or music producer who wants to take their workflow to the next level. But, like most electronic devices, the Behringer Vmx200 Mixer is designed to work with specific voltage levels.

In my case, I made the mistake of using the wrong voltage when connecting my mixer. I won't go into the details of how it happened, but needless to say, the results were catastrophic. As soon as I powered up the mixer, I heard a loud pop, followed by a plume of smoke that emerged from the device.

I was horrified. I had just destroyed my beloved mixer, and I had no idea how I was going to replace it. But things only got worse from there. The next thing I knew, my entire audio setup was malfunctioning. The speakers were crackling, the amps were overheating, and even my computer was acting up.

I quickly realized that I had caused a surge in the electrical system, and that surge had damaged every component in the audio setup. It was a complete disaster, and one that could have easily been avoided if I had just paid closer attention to the voltage requirements of my mixer.

But all was not lost. After taking a deep breath and assessing the damage, I was able to start rebuilding my audio setup, piece by piece. I had to replace my mixer, my speakers, and my amps, but I also took the opportunity to upgrade my equipment and invest in higher-quality components.

It was a painful experience, but it taught me a valuable lesson. When working with electronic devices, it's critical to pay attention to the voltage requirements and make sure everything is properly connected. A simple mistake can lead to costly and irreversible damage.

In the end, I was able to come back stronger from my disastrous mistake. My new audio setup is better than ever, and I've learned to appreciate the importance of safety and caution when working with electronic devices.

So if you're a DJ or music producer, take my advice and always double-check the voltage requirements before connecting any equipment. Trust me, you don't want to learn this lesson the hard way.


## Chosen Solution
 So I pluged my Behringer mixer to a 220v power outlet here in Chile but it was the US version.

I opened it and checked on everything, the fuse was broken, I changed it and it still doesn't work.
This is how everything was.

The first part seemed OK.

Next it was connected to a power transformer (it seems OK as well).

Then this part which is all the outputs on the back.

And from there to the big board which I think is where the problem is.


That kind of looks fried.


There is a knob in the other side.
There are some few other places that looks a brownish like that but not as much  as that knob.
I have no knowledge in electronics apart from building a pc and changing modular things in my phone haha, so if someone could tell me what the problem might be or how to check to eliminate other possibilities it would be greatly appreciated.

 @jotitax post an image zooming in to the area you circled. this looks like it may have been worked on before. Could be just flux from a previous repair. Post an image of the label on top of the transformer so we can see what we are dealing with. Measure the voltage on the transformer and it looks like an AC transformer so make sure you measure in AC mode.
