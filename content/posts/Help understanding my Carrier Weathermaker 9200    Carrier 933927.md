## Chosen Solution
 I have 2.  One upflow, the other downflow.  Upflow works great, using it for comparison.
Downflow max temp at floor vent is 70 degrees- varies a couple degrees from vent to vent).  (Upflow vents are around 90 degrees)
I can see blue flame at the “sight portal”.  There is/was a smell similar to burnt resistor in the house. Checked furnace areas easily accessible to me for source found none. Fan runs

 Hi @d544
Not sure if this information is relevant to your particular model variant (58MCA and 58MXA) but check if there is a LED fault code display on the control board or if not if there is any obvious component damage on the board at all. (see p.9-10 on the document linked).
What is the full model number of the unit? Perhaps check if there is a product info label on the unit somewhere (on the back?) rather than the brand/model name on the front.
Knowing the correct model number will help to find the correct spare parts if there is a faulty part that needs replacing.
