# Revolutionary New App Shakes Up Kenya's Transportation Industry - Say Goodbye to Overpriced Rides Forever!

The transportation industry in Kenya is known for its high prices and unreliable services. But with the arrival of a new app, things are about to change. The app, called "Ride Connect," is set to revolutionize the way people in Kenya commute, making it easy, affordable and reliable.

Ride Connect is a ride-hailing app that enables passengers to connect with local drivers in real-time. The app works by matching passengers with nearby drivers, who offer safe and reliable rides at fair prices. The app's GPS tracking system ensures that both passengers and drivers can always locate each other with ease.

One of the most striking features of Ride Connect is its pricing system. Unlike other ride-hailing apps in Kenya, Ride Connect does not hike up prices during peak hours or when demand is high. The app charges a flat rate, regardless of the time or day of the week, making it the most affordable option for commuters in Kenya.

The app has also introduced a rewards program that incentivizes users to invite friends and family to use the app. Users earn points for each successful referral, and these points can be redeemed for discounted rides. This program not only helps users save money but also expands the Ride Connect network, making it even more accessible and reliable.

Ride Connect has also taken measures to ensure the safety of its users. All drivers must pass a rigorous background check before joining the platform. The app's rating system enables passengers to rate drivers after each ride, ensuring that only the best drivers stay on the platform.

The app's user interface is user-friendly, making it simple and easy to use. Users can book rides with just a few clicks, view their driver's profile, and track their ride in real-time. The app's customer support team is also available 24/7, providing assistance and resolving issues promptly.

Ride Connect is set to shake up Kenya's transportation industry, providing a reliable, affordable, and safe option for commuters. With its fair pricing, rewards program, and stringent safety measures, Ride Connect is quickly becoming the go-to option for Kenyans looking for a hassle-free commute. Say goodbye to overpriced rides forever and welcome the revolutionary Ride Connect app.

inDriver came to Africa last year in November when they set up shop in Tanzania, followed by South Africa this year in April, and now the service is in Nairobi where they claim to already have over 5,000 drivers on board.
 
The company says they’ve been running tests in Nairobi to collect feedback, and the data shows that prices became more attractive for passengers. They claim that passengers using the app pay on average 20% less than with other services. 
 
With other Taxi Apps, prices can vary depending on peak hours, traffic, and one’s request history. For example, an estimate can be 300 shillings, but because of traffic, delays, or even just an influx in demand, you may end up paying over 500 shillings. inDriver’s Real Time Deals model is looking to change that as you agree with the driver beforehand. 
 

 
## How does inDriver Work?
 
The app’s Real Time Deals model combats algorithms used by other ride-hailing companies, which rack up prices because of peak hours, traffic and request history. inDriver allows passengers to set their own fare for their chosen route. Nearby drivers who receive notice of ride requests have three choices – accept the fare offered, ignore the offer or bargain for a higher price.
 
The inDriver service is already operating in South Africa and  Tanzania. Representatives of the app claim that they have already connected more than 5,000 drivers in Nairobi, with dozens of new drivers being registered daily. In an effort to attract more drivers to sign up with them, inDriver is not charging drivers any commission.
 
The inDriver app is already available for Android and iOS and we’ll be testing the service in the next coming days.
