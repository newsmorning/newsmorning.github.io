Have you ever made a mistake with your electronic device that changed everything? Well, I certainly have, and I'm here to share my story of how I accidentally "bricked" my iPad 4 Wi-Fi, but ended up discovering a whole new world of possibilities.

It all started when I wanted to update my iPad's software to the latest iOS version. I had never updated it before and I thought it would be a good idea to keep my device current. However, I failed to realize that my iPad 4 was not eligible for the latest iOS update.

I went ahead with the update anyway, and before I knew it, my iPad was frozen on the Apple logo screen. I tried resetting it, but nothing seemed to work. I searched online for solutions and found that I had "bricked" my iPad, meaning that it was rendered useless and couldn't be fixed through normal means.

I was devastated. My iPad was an essential part of my life, and now it was gone. But, I refused to give up on it just yet.

After scouring the internet for hours, I stumbled upon something called "jailbreaking." I had never heard of it before, but it seemed like my only option to revive my bricked iPad. Jailbreaking is a process that allows users to gain access to the root file system of their iOS device, which provides more control over the device than the standard operating system.

I was hesitant at first, as I had always been wary of tampering with my device's software. But, I decided to take the risk and attempt to jailbreak my iPad.

It took some time and research to figure out how to jailbreak my device properly, but after a few failed attempts, I finally managed to do it. And, to my surprise, my iPad was no longer bricked. In fact, it was now more functional than ever before.

Jailbreaking allowed me to customize my iPad in ways I never thought possible. I was able to download and use apps that were previously unavailable on the App Store, and I had more control over the device's settings and features. I even increased its battery life by disabling unnecessary processes.

I never would have discovered this new world of possibilities if it wasn't for my mistake of bricking my iPad. Sometimes, mistakes can lead to unexpected and even beneficial outcomes.

In conclusion, my mistake of updating my iPad 4 Wi-Fi to an ineligible iOS version ended up changing my relationship with my device for the better. I never would have considered jailbreaking my device before, but now I can't imagine using it without the added functions and customization options. So, the next time you make a mistake with your electronic device, don't give up hope. You might just discover a whole new world of possibilities.

## Chosen Solution
 I have broken off the square 5 wire connector next to the home button ribbon cable, and all the soldered leads are no longer attached. How to repair?
I have attached two pictures from the guide. I mistook the connector as the picture was a little too small to see, only after "prying up the flap" did I discover I pried up the soldered connector.
Is this repairable or have I junked my new iPad 4th ten pride and joy?
Here are pictures where the connector is shown as right next to the cable connectorâ€¦

 The connector can be replaced but the leads may need to be re-routed. It is a difficult repair, you could ruin it further if not done carefully
