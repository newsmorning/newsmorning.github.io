# You won’t believe what music lovers are downloading now – Deezer’s universal app for Windows 10 is finally here!

If you’re a music lover who’s on Windows 10, we’ve got some exciting news for you. Deezer, the global music streaming service, has finally released its universal app for Windows 10. With the release of this app, you can now enjoy streaming your favorite tracks directly from your desktop or tablet, without having to access the Deezer website or rely on third-party apps.

Deezer, which has a user base of over 16 million music enthusiasts, is widely popular for its extensive music library and personalized playlist recommendations. It offers high-quality audio streams, curated content, and an easy-to-use interface that allows users to access their music quickly and easily.

Now, with the launch of the universal Windows 10 app, Deezer has expanded its reach even further by making it easier for Windows 10 users to access the service. The app has been designed specifically to cater to the needs of Windows 10 users, with features such as Live Tiles, Cortana voice commands, and a streamlined user interface that provides quick access to search, favorites, and recently played tracks.

One of the best things about the Deezer app is its integration with Microsoft’s Groove Music Pass, which allows users to create and listen to playlists from both services in one place. This gives users the ability to enjoy a vast library of music, spanning multiple genres and artists, right from their Windows 10 device.

Another advantage of Deezer’s universal app is that it’s available on all Windows 10 devices, regardless of screen size or form factor. Whether you’re on a desktop, laptop, tablet or phone, the app will automatically adapt to your device’s screen size, providing a user-friendly and consistent experience across all platforms.

In conclusion, the release of Deezer’s universal app for Windows 10 marks a significant milestone for both companies, as it allows users to stream their favorite tracks with ease, and provides access to an incredible library of music. With its intuitive user interface, personalized playlist recommendations, and integration with Microsoft’s Groove Music Pass, the Deezer app is a must-have for music lovers on Windows 10.

Back in December 2015, Deezer announced its new Windows 10 official Universal app. And the Preview version of Deezer’s Windows 10 app finally hit the Windows 10 Store now, more than two months after the announcement.
 
We expected the app to arrive earlier, since Deezer said that it will be released a few weeks after the announcement, but even now, it’s not too late for all Deezer users to enjoy using their favorite music streaming services on their Windows 10 devices.
 
Deezer Windows 10 app is now Universal!
 
The main reason Deezer decided to develop a brand new app, instead of just upgrading the existing one, is that the previous Deezer app isn’t a Universal one, which means that users have to use a different app on every Windows device. Features of the app also varied on every device. 
 
But the new Deezer Windows 10 app is Universal, which means that you can use the same app, with same features, and same design on every Windows 10 device. This is the reason why most developers decide to build a new app for Windows 10, because Microsoft imagined Windows 10 to be a single operating system for all devices, and all apps must work in accordance with that.
 
Besides making the app Universal, Deezer also redesigned the app, with revamped content pages, a new tab bar, and all your favorite music packed into “My Music”. Deezer also changed the update policy, which means that we should expect updates for the app more often. More updates often mean new features, and by knowing the fact that the app is still in its Preview phase, Deezer Windows 10 app will probably become even better and more functional in the future.
 
There’s still no word about Cortana integration with Deezer in Deezer’s app release notes, but since this is a serious service, with a lot of users, Cortana integration is a must, because all other major Windows 10 apps already have it.
 
Windows 10 now running on over 200 million devices around the world, so making its service available on Microsoft’s platform could be an enormous boos for Deezer, since a lot of its users, and potential users are running Windows 10.
