Restart the computer and a new keychain will be created using your current system password. If you have forgotten you whole system password then you will need to reset it using your System Restore disk Is your “Keychain password” the same as your “Administrator password”, the one you use to install software? Or do you have a user account a Mac OS X machine where someone else is the system administrator? If you’re the administrator and you’ve forgotten the password to the login keychain and the administrator password, I am afraid you’ve permanently lost the contents of your keychain. However, you can recover from the situation without reinstalling the entire OS. First, reset the administrator password using the Mac OS X disc:\nInsert the Mac OS X Install disc and restart the computer. When you hear the startup tone, hold down the C key until you see the spinning gear. When the Installer appears, choose Utilities \u003e Reset Password. Follow the onscreen instructions to change the password. Quit the Installer and restart your computer while holding down the mouse button to eject the disc. After the Mac has restarted, you’d normally now need to change the password for the keychain called “login” to match the new admin password, but since you’ve forgotten it you’ll need to delete the old login keychain. Do the following steps: Open Keychain Access, located in /Applications/Utilities. Choose Keychain List from the Edit menu. Select the “login” keychain. Click Delete (the “-” button). The login keychain will now be empty. The next time the keychain is needed you’ll have to manually enter the appropriate password and then you’ll be asked if you want to store the password in the keychain http://en.kioskea.net/forum/affich-73393… Thanks again guys :))) Looking forward to hearing from you soon Annie :))) emory ","wordCount":"1286","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-26T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-26T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Paige Coleman"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/i-need-a-complete-power-cable-adapter-ibook-g3-12-1348221/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Electrify Your Life with This Must-Have Power Accessory for Your Ibook G3 12 - Get Your Complete Power Cable Adapter Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-26 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 26, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1286 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Paige Coleman</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=electrify-your-life-with-this-must-have-power-accessory-for-your-ibook-g3-12---get-your-complete-power-cable-adapter-now>Electrify Your Life with This Must-Have Power Accessory for Your iBook G3 12 - Get Your Complete Power Cable Adapter Now!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#electrify-your-life-with-this-must-have-power-accessory-for-your-ibook-g3-12---get-your-complete-power-cable-adapter-now>#</a></h1><p>The iBook G3 12 is a classic laptop model that has been well-loved by Apple fans through the years.
