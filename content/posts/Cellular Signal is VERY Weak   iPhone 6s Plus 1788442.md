Is Your iPhone 6S Plus Signal Weaker Than Ever? Discover the Shocking Truth!

If you're a proud owner of an iPhone 6S Plus, you may have noticed something strange lately - your device's signal feels weaker than ever. This can be frustrating, especially when you rely on your iPhone to stay connected to the world. But what's causing this sudden issue? And is there anything you can do about it?

The first thing you should know is that you're not alone. Many iPhone 6S Plus users have reported weaker signals, particularly after upgrading to the latest version of iOS. So what's causing this phenomenon? The answer is more complicated than you might think.

One theory is that the iPhone 6S Plus simply doesn't have the best antenna performance. When compared to other smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 or the LG G5, the iPhone's antenna falls short in terms of signal strength and range. This means that even a small drop in performance can have a significant impact on your device's signal.

Another theory is that the latest version of iOS is to blame. Apple has been known to release updates that inadvertently cause problems for users, and this could be one of those cases. Some users have reported that their signal worsened after installing iOS 10.3, which begs the question - did Apple accidentally break something in the code?

So what can you do if you're experiencing weaker signal on your iPhone 6S Plus? Here are a few tips:

1. Update your carrier settings. Your carrier may have released an update that improves your device's signal. To check for updates, go to Settings > General > About and wait for a message to appear.

2. Disable Wi-Fi calling. Wi-Fi calling can actually interfere with your device's cellular signal, so turning this feature off might help. To do this, go to Settings > Cellular > Wi-Fi Calling and toggle the switch to off.

3. Try resetting your network settings. This will wipe out all of your saved Wi-Fi networks and passwords, as well as any cellular settings you may have customized. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.

4. Consider using a signal booster. Signal boosters can be helpful in improving your device's signal, especially if you live in a rural area or a place with poor reception. Just make sure to choose a booster that's compatible with your device.

In conclusion, weaker signal on your iPhone 6S Plus may be frustrating, but there are ways to address it. Whether it's the antenna performance or a software issue, you can take steps to improve your device's connectivity. And who knows - maybe Apple will release a fix in the near future.

## Chosen Solution
 I rebuilt my entire phone and after putting it together the WiFi was not working so I replaced all the antennas. This fixed my WiFi issue but now I get terrible service. Which of the three antennas is for cellular service? Everywhere I look all three are described as the network/wifi/bluetooth antennae (so which one is it for each operation?)
Also my camera was bad before rebuilding so I replaced it ... the first time replacing it seemed to work fine ... then I had to take it out to look at the antennas and after re-installing it it now vibrates again ... i'm hoping this is because the camera got damaged at some point during the de-installation/re-installation process.
Thanks for the help!

 Hey!
First of all, here is the cellular antenna:

It sits directly above the WLAN/Bluetooth-Antenna.
I also replaced the housing about one year ago and did not noticed any issues with the cellular connection. But I also can imagine a bad-quality housing COULD cause it.
If you are sure the cables are connected correctly and have no option to test another cellular antenna I would try to use your old housing to test if it works fine there. Yes, it is a LOT of ugly work to but all back, but finally you can find out if the issue is the housing or the phone.

 I would try disconnecting all of the antennas and cleaning anywhere they need to make conductive contact on both the male and female sides of each connector using a q-tip and 99% isopropyl. I have experienced finger grease interrupting both wifi and cell signal just from touching a connector while plugging it in.
