# You Won't Believe What Showed Up On My iPod Nano 7th Generation Screen - Click Here To Find Out! 

As technology evolves, we continue to see the integration of newer and better features onto electronic devices. The iPod Nano 7th generation is one such device that has proven its worth in the modern world. Recently, however, something quite unusual happened with my iPod Nano 7th generation. I was so amazed that I couldn't help but share it with the world.

Firstly, let's talk about how the iPod Nano 7th generation is such a cool device. It comes with an incredibly lightweight and slim design, which is perfect for music lovers who are always on the go. Additionally, its 2.5-inch touchscreen display is pretty solid, allowing you to have a seamless navigation experience, and the battery life is impressive by any standards.

Now, let's get back to the story. One day, while scrolling through my music playlist, I noticed something odd on the screen - a small black dot, about the size of a period, appeared. At first, I thought it was a scratch on the display since I always carry my iPod Nano in my pocket with keys and other items. However, as if by magic, the dot started to expand, and within a few seconds, it had formed a perfect circle. At this point, I was utterly shocked and intrigued.

Without further ado, I clicked on the dot, and to my surprise, it was a tiny game called "Pong" - a classic video game from the early '70s. The game worked just like the original, but it was much smaller and designed for the iPod Nano's touchscreen.

I could hardly contain my excitement! I had no idea that such a game was present on my device, let alone for it to appear the way it did. I tried to search for information about this game on the iPod Nano 7th generation, but I couldn't find anything.

The game was so addictive that it forced me to keep playing it in my spare time. It was quite fascinating to witness the evolution of technology through the integration of classic games on modern devices.

In conclusion, I can say that this experience has made me appreciate the iPod Nano 7th generation even more. The little device packs a surprise game that you won't find in any other gadget - what an unexpected delight! Who knows, maybe there are other secrets hidden within the device, waiting to be discovered.

So, if you're an iPod Nano 7th generation owner, take some time to explore your device; you might find some hidden, intriguing features that you never knew existed!

## Chosen Solution
 How can I remove it? if not DIY, how much is the parts?

 Before you replace the lad try rubbing it out.
I fixed my screen by starting on the middle of the line and rubbing to the edges it doesn't happen right away but each time I used it more of the line was gone I only rubbed it a few minutes at at time.
It took a few days of this till the line was gone but it was worth it.

 Usually resolved by replacing the LCD, well always out of my experience but I'm sure sometimes it could be Board Related. First thing I'd try would be a LCD change, this isn't sold on Ifixit yet so here's a link:

From eBay UK but if you look I'm sure it will be on eBay.com as well.
Please read through this guide before ordering, it will show you how complex it is and it will be up to you to decide whether you can do it or not.
