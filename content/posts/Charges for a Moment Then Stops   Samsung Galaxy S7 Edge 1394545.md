Title: You Won't Believe Why Your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is Charging Just to Quit! Find Out Now!

Are you frustrated with your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge's charging issues? Does your phone charge only to quit seconds later? If you answered yes to both questions, then you're probably curious about what's causing the problem. In this article, we're going to discuss the possible reasons behind your phone's charging issues.

Firstly, charging problems with your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge could occur due to a dirty charging port. Technically, this issue could happen to all types of smartphones. Sometimes, dirt, dust, or debris accumulate inside the charging port, affecting the connection of the charging cable. If your phone's charging port is dirty, then you won't be able to charge your device, or the charging process will take a long time. To fix this issue, you can simply clean the charging port with a toothbrush or compressed air.

Secondly, your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge could be charging and stopping because of a faulty battery. Lithium-ion batteries tend to lose their capacity over time, leading to degraded performance. If your phone's battery becomes worn down, it won't be able to retain enough charge to power your device. You might notice that your phone's battery drains faster than usual, even when it's on standby. To solve this problem, you'll need to replace your phone's battery with a new one.

Thirdly, charging issues could be due to a damaged charging cable. A faulty or damaged charging cable will cause your phone to charge and discontinue the process. One way to test if your charging cable is working well is by trying it on another phone or device. If your charging cable is indeed the problem, then you need to replace it with a new one.

Lastly, our Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge charging problem could be due to a damaged charging port. This issue often happens when the charging port has been modified, or if the charging cable is mishandled. A damaged charging port won't properly connect to the charging cable, thereby causing charging issues. To fix this issue, you'll need to bring your phone to a professional for repair, or you can opt to replace the charging port on your own.

In conclusion, charging problems with your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge are frustrating, but there are various ways to resolve them. Whether it's a dirty charging port, a faulty battery, a damaged charging cable, or a damaged charging port, knowing the cause of the problem is the first step to finding the right solution. Keep in mind that some solutions require professional help, so don't hesitate to seek assistance if you're not confident in fixing the issue on your own.

## Chosen Solution
 Hey fixers!
so i lost my phone when i was out drinking and fortunately it got found. since i have it back, when i charge it  it shows the charging logo on the screen but after a few seconds the screen gets a bit brighter and then stops. so it doesnt go to the screen where you see the battery with the percentage in there or the led light which is usually red when it charges in the top right corner.   (the phone was out of battery life since having)
What i have tried (with no succes):
-battery replacement
-cleaning charging port
-look for water damage
is this a charging port problem? i cant try wireless because i dont have it.
or maybe a motherboard or display problem?
Thanks in advance and cheers!

 What happens when you try to hold the power button for about 10 seconds while it's plugged into the charger?
