Are you thinking of transforming your WordPress site into a fully functioning WordPress membership site? Choosing the right WordPress membership plugin is vital for your business and its opportunity for growth.
 
Membership sites let you control who has access to downloads, forums, and online content. Only those who have registered as a member will have permission. 
 
Other reasons to having a membership site (say, for creating an online course or community group) include:
 

 
- Helping to establish you as the authority in your nicheGenerating income from paid subscriptions Growing and engaging your email list

 
This article will outline and compare WordPress membership plugins to help you make an educated decision about which one is best for you.
 
## Things To Consider
 
When choosing the best membership WordPress plugin, consider the following:
 
- Is the plugin compatible with other WordPress plugins you’re using? It is well-known that often plugins don’t play well together and can cause functions to stop working and can even break a site. Test the plugin on a local installation or a sandbox environment before installing it on your live website.What specific features and functionality do you need? The WordPress membership plugin you choose should provide you with the ability to create and design the site to your specifications.How easy is the plugin to use? Unless you plan on hiring a programmer to run and manage your membership site, make sure the plugin is user-friendly and you understand how to use it.

 
## S2Member
 
S2Member is a feature-rich WordPress membership plugin. The name of the free version is Framework. It integrates with PayPal Website Payments.
 
Other features include restricting content by posts or pages, categories, and post types. You can also restrict:
 
- Specific URL fragmentsFile downloadsContent snippets within postsStreaming media

 
Additional features include:
 
- Custom login welcome pagesEmail templatesIP restrictionsStrong protections

 
While S2Member’s Framework (free) version comes with a robust set of features, it does limit the membership levels to four.
 
For more levels and additional functionality, choose from one of the two premium upgrades. The Pro Version costs $89 one-time for a single-site license. Pro for unlimited sites costs $189 one-time.
 
S2Member’s Pro versions include everything from Framework plus:
 
- Content drip featuresCustom profile fields, pages, and one-step registrationCoupon and gift registration codesOther payment integrations such as Authorize.net, Stripe, ClickBank, and PayPal Pro, in addition to PayPal

 
If you’re first starting with a membership site, try the free version. If it works for your needs, you can always upgrade to the Pro version later.
 
S2Members have access to extensive documentation and a support knowledgebase. Email-based support is also available to Pro users.
 
Compared to some other WordPress membership plugins, S2Member is a little more difficult to learn.
 
## MemberPress
 
MemberPress is one of the most popular of all WordPress membership plugins. It is also easy to use and feature-rich.
 
If you are not tech-savvy and want to set up and manage your own membership site, MemberPress is a plugin you should check out.

There is no free version of MemberPress and no free trial. They do, however, offer a 14-day money-back guarantee. There are three pricing levels:
 
- Basic $149/yearPlus: $249/yearPro: $349/year

 
Because MemberPress only accepts the most popular payment gateways, if you live in a country that doesn’t support these gateways, this WordPress membership plugin won’t work for you.

Designed for subscription products, premium content membership sites, and associations, Paid Membership Pro is a free plugin to add a new revenue source to your website.
 
Customize your membership site to fit your business needs with features such as:

If you need more extensive features like affiliate tracking and an approval process for membership, Paid Membership Pro has over 60 free and paid add-ons.
 
Some of the more advanced features require coding. So, if your business requires configurations such as pro-rating adjustments for upgrades, you will need to either be a programmer or have access to someone who understands code.
