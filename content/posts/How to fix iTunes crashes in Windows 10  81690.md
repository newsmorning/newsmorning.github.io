iTunes crashes are a common occurrence for Windows 10 and 8 users. While it is true that iTunes has a reputation for being a bit buggy, most of these issues can be solved by making sure that your Windows operating system is up-to-date and that your iTunes software is running smoothly. In this article, we will go over some of the top tips for fixing frustrating iTunes crashes on your Windows 10 and 8 devices.

## Check for Updates

One of the most common reasons for iTunes crashes is outdated software. Make sure that your iTunes software is up-to-date by checking for updates regularly. To do this, open iTunes and click on Help > Check for Updates. This will automatically search for the latest version of iTunes and install it on your computer if necessary.

It is also important to keep your Windows operating system up-to-date. To do this, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and click on Check for Updates. This will ensure that your operating system is running smoothly and that any bugs are fixed.

## Disable Compatibility Mode

Sometimes, iTunes crashes on Windows 10 and 8 devices because it is running in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode is a feature that allows older software to run on newer versions of Windows. However, it can cause issues with newer software like iTunes. To disable compatibility mode, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the iTunes icon and select Properties.
2. Click on the Compatibility tab.
3. Uncheck the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for".
4. Click Apply and then OK.

## Disable Auto-Sync

Auto-sync can also cause issues with iTunes. This feature automatically syncs your devices with your iTunes library when they are connected. However, it can cause iTunes to crash if it is running while you are trying to sync your devices. To disable auto-sync, follow these steps:

1. Open iTunes and click on Edit > Preferences.
2. Click on the Devices tab.
3. Check the box that says "Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically".
4. Click OK.

## Reinstall iTunes

If all else fails, you may need to reinstall iTunes on your Windows 10 or 8 device. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Uninstall iTunes by going to Control Panel > Programs and Features and clicking on iTunes. Then, click on Uninstall.
2. Download the latest version of iTunes from the Apple website.
3. Install iTunes by running the downloaded file.

In conclusion, iTunes crashes on Windows 10 and 8 devices can be a frustrating experience. However, most of these issues can be solved by making sure that your software is up-to-date, disabling compatibility mode and auto-sync, and reinstalling iTunes if necessary. By following these top tips, you can say goodbye to frustrating iTunes crashes once and for all!

This is a new computer so I never had a chance to try itunes under windows 8. However when I installed it for windows 8.1 it initially seemed to work until I tried to log in to my account.
