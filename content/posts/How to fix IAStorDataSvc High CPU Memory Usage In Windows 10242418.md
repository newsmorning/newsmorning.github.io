Say Goodbye to Slow Windows 10: Get Rid of Iastordatasvc High CPU Usage With This Quick Fix!

Are you tired of slow performance on your Windows 10 PC? Is the iastordatasvc process hogging your CPU and slowing you down? If you answered yes to these questions, then read on because we have a quick fix for you!

Firstly, let's understand that Iastordatasvc is a service that is related to the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver. This driver is responsible for storage management and could improve your system's performance when used correctly. However, when the driver is not working optimally, it can cause high CPU usage, slowing down your PC. Fortunately, there are ways to fix this issue.

The first step to get rid of Iastordatasvc high CPU usage is to disable the service. Follow the steps below:

Step 1: Press the "Windows Key" and the "R" key simultaneously to open the Run dialog box.

Step 2: Type "services.msc" into the dialog box and hit "Enter".

Step 3: Scroll down to the "Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology" service.

Step 4: Right-click on the service and select "Properties".

Step 5: Under the "General" tab, change the Startup type to "Disabled".

Step 6: Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes.

By disabling the service, you have stopped it from running in the background and hogging your CPU resources. However, this is not a permanent solution as it only stops the service from running when you boot your PC. If you want a more permanent solution, you need to update your Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver.

You can update your driver by following these simple steps:

Step 1: Open the Start menu and type "Device Manager" in the search bar.

Step 2: Click on "Device Manager" to open it.

Step 3: Locate the "Storage controllers" category.

Step 4: Right-click on your Intel (R) Rapid Storage Technology controller and select "Update driver."

Step 5: Click on "Search automatically for updated driver software." Windows will automatically search for the latest driver and install it.

Once you have updated your driver, you can re-enable the "Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology" service by following the steps above and changing the Startup type to "Automatic."

In conclusion, fixing Iastordatasvc high CPU usage is not complicated. By disabling the service or updating your driver, you can get rid of the issue and improve your system's performance. Therefore, don't tolerate slow performance any longer but follow the steps outlined above to get your PC running smoothly again!

There are many processes in our computer which consume high CPU memory usage. These processes can lead to applications and software crashing now and then or even computer functioning slow.
 
On the face of it, these processes don’t look harmful, and in most cases, to be honest, it’s some defect in them, which causes issues. One such process is IAStorDataSvc, which is not a harmful process in itself. Still, sometimes it can take a toll on your CPU usage, which is essential to take necessary steps to either disable IAStorDataSvc or take other measures, which we shall discuss in this blog.
 
What Is IAStoreDataSvc 32 bit?
 
IAStoreDataSvc can be translated as Intel Data Service, which is used by Intel Rapid Storage Technology. It gives you faster access to your frequently used programs. This process sometimes consumes 60%-85% of CPU. While otherwise intended to enhance computer performance, it is because of this CPU usage that it further deteriorates the performance of your computer.
 
Note: When IAStorDataSvc consumes more CPU, it might be an outdated firmware or infected.
 
## How To Tackle IAStoreDataSvc High CPU Usage?
 
In a scenario when IAStoreDataSvc consumes more CPU power, it’s time to put a strap on the situation. And, here are some ways to do just that –
 
### 1. Uninstall Intel Rapid Storage Technology With The Help Of Control Panel
 
Since now we have an idea that the reason for the IAStorDataSvc high CPU issue could be Intel Rapid Storage Technology, you can uninstall it from the Control Panel.
 
- Type Control Panel in the Windows search bar and click on Open
 - Click on Programs and Features
 - Select Intel Rapid Storage Technology from the given list of programs
 - From the top, click on the Uninstall button

 
But, what if you stumble upon a situation where your Control Panel is not working properly or not working at all? Worry not! We’ve got your sorted.
 
### 2. Quickest Way To Deal With The Issue
