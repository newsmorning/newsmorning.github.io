TITLE: SHOCKING! Discover the REAL Reason Why Your Ematic Funtab2 Won't Charge - You Won't Believe It!

    Are you a parent struggling to charge your child's Ematic Funtab2? Have you tried everything but still can't get it to charge? Well, we have some shocking news for you - the problem may not be the tablet at all!

    The Ematic Funtab2 has been specifically designed as a child-friendly tablet. It has a 7-inch display, a camera, and preloaded with educational games and apps. However, it has one major flaw - it only works with the charger that comes in the box. Yes, you read that right, it only works with that specific charger.

    The Ematic Funtab2 charger has a unique voltage output of 5 volts and 2.5 amperes. This means that if you try to charge the tablet with any other charger, it may not charge at all or charge very slowly. This is because the tablet needs a specific voltage and amperage to function properly.

    So, if you have been using a different charger to charge your child's Ematic Funtab2, you may have damaged the tablet's charging port, battery, or both. This could explain why the tablet won't charge at all or why it takes forever to charge.

    To avoid this problem, it's crucial that you use only the charger that comes in the box to charge the tablet. If you lose the charger or it gets damaged, you can order a replacement charger from the Ematic online store.

    In conclusion, the reason why your Ematic Funtab2 won't charge may not be the tablet's fault after all. It could be because you have been using the wrong charger all along. So, always remember to use only the charger that comes in the box to charge the tablet, and save yourself the headache of dealing with a broken charging port or battery.
