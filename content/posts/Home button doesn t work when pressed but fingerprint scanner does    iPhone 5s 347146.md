# You Won't Believe Why Your iPhone 5S Home Button Fails - But Here's How to Fix It!

Have you been experiencing issues with your iPhone 5S's home button lately? If so, you're not alone. Many iPhone 5S owners have reported problems with their home button, from it not responding to touch to it feeling mushy or stuck.

So why does this happen? Believe it or not, the problem isn't necessarily with the button itself. It's actually caused by a buildup of debris or gunk underneath the button, which can interfere with its function. Over time, the accumulation of dirt and grime can cause the button to become less responsive or even stop working altogether.

But before you panic and rush off to the Apple store for a costly repair or replacement, there's good news: you can often fix the problem yourself. Here are a few things you can try to restore your home button back to its former glory:

## 1. Clean the area around the home button

First and foremost, try wiping away any dirt or debris that might be clogging up your home button. Use a soft, lint-free cloth (like a microfiber towel) to gently clean around the edges of the button. Be careful not to press too hard or get any moisture inside the button, as this could cause further damage.

## 2. Use a toothbrush

If simply wiping away the grime doesn't do the trick, you can try using a toothbrush to gently scrub away any stubborn debris. Dip the toothbrush in a small amount of rubbing alcohol, then use circular motions to clean around the button. Again, be gentle and avoid getting any liquid inside the button.

## 3. Recalibrate the home button

Sometimes, the problem with your home button may simply be a calibration issue. To recalibrate the button, follow these steps:

1. Turn on your iPhone and open any default app (like the Clock app).
2. Press and hold the power button until the "slide to power off" slider appears.
3. Release the power button and hold down the home button for about 5-10 seconds, until the app closes and you are returned to the home screen.

This should recalibrate your home button and hopefully fix any responsiveness issues.

## 4. Enable AssistiveTouch

If all else fails, you can always enable AssistiveTouch. This feature provides a virtual home button on your iPhone's screen, which you can use instead of the physical button. Here's how to turn it on:

1. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility.
2. Scroll down to the Interaction section and tap on AssistiveTouch.
3. Turn on the AssistiveTouch toggle.

Once enabled, you can use the AssistiveTouch button to access the home screen, activate Siri, or perform other gestures that would normally require the physical home button.

In conclusion, while a failing home button on your iPhone 5S can be frustrating, it doesn't necessarily mean you need to shell out big bucks for a repair or replacement. With some simple cleaning and recalibration steps, you can often restore your button to its former glory. So don't give up hope â€“ try these tips and see if they work for you!

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced the screen for a 5s and when I was done, the home button wouldn't respond when I clicked it. But then my client tried to click it and it responded to his fingerprint and unlocked the phone.
Can't find anything about this anywhere. It goes against everything I know about iPhone 5s home button flex cables. It's ridiculous.

 Yea make sure it's seeded in the socket correctly and look for damage on the socket were it plugs in.
Could be you damaged the button when removing

 Hello Ryan on the back of the home button there is a small black nub, if it is flush with the back of the home button it will not work, if it is raised then there is another problem, it may need replaced.
Word of warning if you replace the home button your 5s the Touch ID will never work as every handset has its own personal button.
Hope this helps

 I have the same problem, and I know now that I misplaced the screen shield screws, because I had the bluescreen issue, but put screws back where they belong and seemed to work fine except for the home button. Finger scanner works, but not the home button. Are there any traces on motherboard under that screen screw that is related to home button or am I chasing my tail here. Tried reconnecting xx amount of times to no good. Tried swapping home button to no use , then the finger scanner died too ofcourse so put stock home button back so at least the scanner is working now. Should I go aheadand change the Lightning dock connector that home buttons connect too, or do you guys think its related to motherboard trace issues??

 Ryan, did you ever find a solution to this? I am having the same issue after replacing my battery.

 Hi, I have same problem, Home button doesn't work when pressed but fingerprint scanner does. Also, The home button WORKS when the screen is open in any position. Could it be something on the cables?
Thanks
