Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Plugged in My Samsung TV - Find Out What Went Wrong Here!

Introduction
I had been patiently waiting to upgrade my TV and when I finally got my hands on the latest Samsung TV model, I was beyond excited. After unboxing it and plugging it in, I was anticipating the crystal-clear picture quality and immersive sound experience. But to my disappointment, the red light turned on, and the screen stayed black. I was pretty sure I had followed all the instructions correctly, so I wondered what had gone wrong. After some troubleshooting, I was able to identify the problem, and I'm here to share my experience with you.

Main Body

What's Up With the Red Light?
If your Samsung TV has been plugged in, and the red light is on but the screen remains black, that could mean one of several things. Firstly, it could mean the TV has a faulty power supply. The TV's power supply is responsible for providing the necessary voltage to turn on the TV, and if it's not working correctly, the TV won't turn on. Another reason the red light could remain on is due to a burnt-out bulb. If the TV has been used for an extended period, it's worth checking the bulb. You can usually find the bulb at the back of the TV, and its location will vary depending on your particular TV model. If the bulb is burnt out, you'll need to replace it.

Check Your HDMI Cable
If you have confirmed that the TV's power supply and bulb are both fine, it's time to check the HDMI cable. Using a different HDMI cable, plug it into the TV and see if it works. If the cable you used previously was damaged, using a new one will resolve the issue. If the new cable works, toss the damaged one and continue enjoying your Samsung TV. If it doesn't, then it might be the HDMI port that is problematic.

Faulty HDMI Port
It's not uncommon for an HDMI port to develop faults, especially if it's been overused. To check if the HDMI port is the problem, switch HDMI ports on the TV and see if the problem is resolved. If the screen comes on with the new HDMI port, then the initial HDMI port might be faulty. If you're not lucky, and neither of the HDMI ports works, then it's time to try out the next solution.

Reset Your Samsung TV
Sometimes, all your TV needs is a simple reset. Hold the power button down on the TV's remote until the TV turns off. Wait a few seconds and turn the TV back on. If the screen remains black, switch off the TV again, and unplug it from the power source. Leave it for a few minutes before plugging it back in and turning on the TV. With any luck, the TV will reset and start working correctly again.

Conclusion
Finding out your Samsung TV won't turn on the first time you plug it in can be frustrating. However, before you call in the professionals, or start planning to return it to the store, try out the above solutions. It could be a minor issue that's quickly fixable, saving you time and money. If none of the above solutions work, it's best to contact Samsung customer support, and they will be able to provide with expert assistance.

 @nickyyy we would need to know what the exact model of your TV is. right now it does sound like either a bad power board or bad main board. Remove the back of your tV and take a look with the power board first. Check all the fuses on the board for continuity and power. Post some pictures of all of your boards so we can see what you see.
