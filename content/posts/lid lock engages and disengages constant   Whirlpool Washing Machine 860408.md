Is your Whirlpool washing machine possessed? Discover the bizarre reason behind the constant lid lock engagement and disengagement!

If you own a Whirlpool washing machine, you may have noticed that the lid lock on your machine engages and disengages constantly during the wash cycle. This may be strange and even concerning to new owners, but there is a logical and necessary explanation for it.

Whirlpool washing machines use a special lid lock mechanism that keeps the lid securely closed during the wash cycle. This lock mechanism is important because it prevents any accidental spills or injury while the machine is in use. However, the lock mechanism is designed to disengage during certain parts of the wash cycle, such as during the rinse and spin cycles.

During the rinse and spin cycles, the Whirlpool washing machine needs to drain any remaining water from the drum before proceeding with the next stage of the cycle. This is where the lid lock mechanism comes into play. To ensure that the machine drains properly, the lid lock will disengage temporarily to allow the water to drain out. Once the machine has drained the water, the lid lock will engage again, ensuring that the lid remains securely closed during the rest of the wash cycle.

It's important to note that the lid lock disengagement is a normal part of the Whirlpool washing machine's functionality. It does not mean that the machine is malfunctioning or possessed in any way. However, if you notice that the lid lock is engaging and disengaging excessively or at irregular intervals, it may indicate a problem with the lock mechanism itself. In this case, it's best to contact a qualified technician to diagnose and repair the issue.

In conclusion, if you own a Whirlpool washing machine and notice that the lid lock is engaging and disengaging continuously during certain parts of the wash cycle, don't be alarmed. This is a normal and necessary function of the machine's lid lock mechanism. However, if you suspect that there is a problem with the lock mechanism, it's best to seek the help of a qualified technician to resolve the issue. With proper maintenance and care, your Whirlpool washing machine will continue to serve you well for many years to come.

 Hi,
Here's the tech sheet for the washer.
Run the diagnostics as described in the tech sheet, to find out whether the problem is a lid switch fault (F5 E1) or a lid lock fault (F5 E2).
There's a code chart in the tech sheet that shows how to decode the lights to know what the error code is:
Fill/Sensing + Rinse + Done = F5,
Done = E1.
Fill/Sensing + Rinse + Done = F5,
Spin = E2
In any event unless it is a wiring problem between the control board and the lid lock assembly (see wiring diagram in tech sheet) or a fault in the control board, most probably the lid lock assembly will need to be replaced. The lid switch is also in the lid lock assembly
Here's a link to a supplier that may help, as there's a video in the page that shows how to replace it.
If you determine that the problem is in the lid lock assembly, search online for W11307244 to find suppliers that suit you best.
