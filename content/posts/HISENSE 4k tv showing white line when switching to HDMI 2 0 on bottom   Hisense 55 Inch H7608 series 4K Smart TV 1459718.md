## Chosen Solution
 When I switch to HDMI 2.0 for gaming on my XBOX ONE X, i see a large white line on the bottom of my screen as seen here. https://i.gyazo.com/303721cefe0d901a6442... it flashes rapidly but turns off instantly as soon as i switch off the HDMI 2.0 feature ...its only when i put that..this weird flashing line appears on the bottom of my screen - anyone have any idea what that is?

 Just so you know it only happens when you switch from a 4k game to a non 4k game
soon all the games will be 4k problem gone
if you do have the white line just restart the Xbox or go to settings video output and change the color depth to 24 and then change it back to 32 or whatever

 I know this is super old. But if you disable YCC4:2:2 then the tv will display 4k HDR content without the wite line. I have a Sharp Aquos (made by Highsense) and it has the same issue. Forcing my PS4 to display in YUV420 and disabling YCC4:2:2 in my Xbox One S settings fixed the problem
You also need to make sure the HDMI port is set to Enhanced 2.1
