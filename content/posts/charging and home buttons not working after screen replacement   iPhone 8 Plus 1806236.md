# WARNING: Screen Replacement Could DESTROY Your iPhone 8 Plus Charging and Home Buttons!!!

Replacing the screen of your iPhone 8 Plus can be a daunting task, especially if you're doing it yourself. But, did you know that a simple mistake during the replacement process could destroy your device's charging and home buttons?

There are many horror stories of people who have attempted to replace their iPhone screen only to find that the device's charging and home buttons no longer work. This isn't just an inconvenience, it's a major issue that can render your phone useless.

So, what exactly causes this problem? Well, there are a few things that can go wrong during a screen replacement that can cause damage to your iPhone 8 Plus's charging and home buttons.

Firstly, if you're not careful, you can accidentally bend or damage the ribbons that connect the charging and home buttons to the device's logic board. This can happen if you're not careful when removing the old screen or if you apply too much pressure to the device during the replacement process.

Secondly, if you're not using high-quality replacement parts, you run the risk of damaging your device's charging and home buttons. Cheap or knock-off parts may not be built to the same standards as Apple's original parts, which can cause compatibility issues and eventually lead to button failure.

Lastly, it's important to note that attempting to replace your iPhone 8 Plus's screen yourself can be dangerous if you're not experienced or familiar with the process. Without proper knowledge of the device's inner workings, you could end up causing damage that could cost you more money in the long run.

So, what can you do to avoid damaging your iPhone 8 Plus's charging and home buttons during a screen replacement?

Firstly, it's best to leave the task to a professional if you're not confident in your abilities. An experienced technician will know exactly how to remove the old screen and install the replacement without causing any damage to other parts of the device.

Secondly, make sure you're using high-quality replacement parts. While they may be more expensive than knock-off parts, they're worth the investment if it means avoiding potential damage to your device's buttons.

Lastly, if you do decide to attempt a screen replacement yourself, make sure you do your research and follow step-by-step instructions carefully. Take your time and be gentle with the device throughout the process to avoid causing any unnecessary damage.

In conclusion, screen replacement is a task that should not be taken lightly. If you're not careful or don't know what you're doing, you could end up causing irreversible damage to your iPhone 8 Plus's charging and home buttons. So, before attempting a screen replacement, make sure you're well-informed and prepared to deal with any potential issues that may arise.

## Chosen Solution
 hi, so i’ve recently replaced the screen on my iPhone 8 Plus, and now i’m facing the following problems with it:
it’s only charging wirelessly, tho the Lightning port is giving audio signals to the headphones.the home button is not working, but Touch ID does.
what do you suppose is the problem?
Update (10/08/2019)
also, it turns off by it seld when shaken or moved too much

 Charger port might need replacement
The home button could be effected or if you have another screen to try it on to see if old screen isnt completely broken test it on the old

 The loss of home button functionality while retaining the use of Touch ID is likely caused by damage to the IC that is on the home button. To resolve this you could either bring it to Apple for a screen replacement (where they’ll replace the home button with the whole display) for $219.00CAD or you can order a replacement home button from JC or HX  and you’ll regain the home button, but lose Touch ID functionality.
As far as the charge port issue,  it could be some damage to the flex cables that is preventing charging but allowing audio, you’d have to connect a working chargeport to the phone and see if there’s any change.
Hope this helps!
