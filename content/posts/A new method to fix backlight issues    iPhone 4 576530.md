# Unlock the Secret Solution to Solve iPhone 4 Backlight Problems - You Won't Believe How Easy It Is!

Are you tired of dealing with iPhone 4 backlight problems? If you own an iPhone 4, you may have experienced a situation where the backlight isn't working. You might think it's a complicated issue, but the solution is so easy that you won't believe it. 

In this article, we'll explore the secret solution to fix iPhone 4 backlight problems in no time. 

## Understanding iPhone 4 Backlight Problems 

Before we can fix iPhone 4 backlight problems, we first need to understand what causes this issue. The backlight is the component that illuminates the LCD screen, and it can fail due to several reasons, including:

- Software bugs
- Damaged hardware components
- Water damage
- Power issues

The most common cause of iPhone 4 backlight problems is damaged hardware components. This can be due to wear and tear, physical damage, or even exposure to heat. 

## The Secret Solution to Fix iPhone 4 Backlight Problems 

Now that we know what causes iPhone 4 backlight problems, let's take a look at the secret solution to fix them. 

The solution is so simple that you can do it at home without the need for professional assistance. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Turn off your iPhone 4: Start by turning off your iPhone 4 by pressing the power button located on the top right corner of the device.

2. Remove the Battery: Once your iPhone 4 is turned off, remove the back cover and the battery.

3. Locate the backlight component: Locate the backlight component at the bottom of the circuit board. It's the small rectangula part with a copper coil wrapped around it.

4. Apply pressure: Gently apply pressure to the backlight component with your fingers. You can use a pair of forceps if you're not comfortable using your fingers.

5. Reassemble: Reinsert the battery and the back cover, then turn on your iPhone 4. The backlight should be working correctly now.

It's that simple! Applying pressure to the backlight component can fix the connection problem and make the backlight work again. 

## Final Thoughts 

iPhone 4 backlight problems can be frustrating, and some people may think that fixing the issue is complex. However, as we've seen, the solution is elementary and requires no professional help. 

By following the steps outlined above, you can fix your iPhone 4 backlight problem in no time. However, suppose the problem persists or you're not comfortable performing the solution yourself. In that case, it's highly recommended to take your iPhone 4 to a professional technician for repair. 

We hope this article has helped you unlock the secret solution to fix iPhone 4 backlight problems. Share this article with your friends and family who may be experiencing similar issues with their iPhone 4.

## Chosen Solution
 My iPhone 4 incurred full water damage (all indicators are pink) however the only issue is the backlight.
The issue is most likely due to the coil and IC.
Sending the phone in would cost me $100 at least to repair without guarantee, and a replacement would cost $199 through Verizon.
I don't have a 100x microscope nor steady hands to solder a new coil and/or IC.
After further research I found the LED backlight cable from the front screen and was wondering if I could run those cables outside of the phone and power them to an external battery with a regular on/off switch.
The idea is that I would turn on both the phone screen and the backlight separately (it's a slight hassle but saves a lot of money.)
How much voltage would I need for the 6 LEDs?
What revision would I need to make to my plan?
-Thank you

 Oh my now I don't have any ideas but what you are planing Is a little crazy just to save a few bucks. All you might need is just a new screen as the other probobly got damaged with the water.
I would try a new screen before you start Frankensteing the iPhone 4

 Draden , in principle I like the idea. I would not even think about applying power to the coil or the IC, just to the connector. Pin 2,4, and 6 are for the backlight. As for how much voltage, you could use a 5V power supply and a potentiometer, start off at 0V and go up until it works. In practice it's a bit more complicated, you can't just apply power to the coil etc. By the time you have done the microsoldering and have it all figured out, and if you do not power surge any other component on the logic board, it will cost you more than a new display. Great approach nevertheless. Hope this helps, good luck

 Just replace the screen and you will be fine :)

 The backlight coil generates something around 15V-20V--so I would consider this plan dangerous.
Why would you think it would cost $100 for a backlight repair?  You can surely get this done for more like $50.
good luck!

 Hi Draden!
I see this post is super old, but I just arrived here from randomly looking posts and wanted to share a bit, maybe someone stumbles here looking for solutions. And, as what I’m going to tell applies for many mobiles, welp! I’ll just share.
So! As much as I likes your crazy Frankenstein idea, I’ve to tell you that it falls quite fast into the crazy part only :). There are a bunch or reasons for your plan to possibly burn your phone down, and in the best of the situations, just make the underlaying problem worse.
The phone backlight works quite straight forward in terms of components, as you will only find 5 parts concerning directly the backlight:
The power management ICThe coilThe diodeThe FilterAnd the LCD connector.
Most of the time the problem resides in one (Or many) of the last 3 (The diode, filter or connector). I’ve read many times that the problem can be on the coil, but every time I’ve encountered a backlight problem’s never the coil. So, just start looking at this three bad boys before getting it with the coil, as it’s quite a sturdy guy.
Usually, when there’s water damage there’s water corrosion on the LCD connector, and always the most affected connectors are the ones related to the backlight, as the pins are carrying around 20v on them, making them usually black and burned more easily damaged. If this is the case, you may need to clean and reflow the contacts.
The second part to check would be the filter, as they are usually the culprit when the backlight isn’t working… Almost always. The filter is a small black and silver ceramic component, usually sitting near the lcd connector (In some iPhones, or iPads, there can be more than one… But for the iPhone 4 and 5 there’s only one for sure). Take you multimeter and test the continuity on this piece, if you get no continuity, then you got your felon (You can usually SEE the damage too, as the ceramic splits, or breaks, and sometimes you can see a little point of the silver solder below). Just take that bastard out and replace it, in case that you can’t do that (Many times they get stuck, really stuck) just create a jumper there with a tiny piece of conductor. This will fix the issue, but maybe you’ll see some small flickering from now on in the backlight when calling, as this is what that filter worked out.
Third, but not last, there’s the backlight diode (Sometimes… Weirdly named “Backlight IC” but… it’s not an IC, just a diode). To find it just follow back the way of the filter, use your multimeter to get continuity from it to the next component looking like a… welp, a diode! When you find it, just test it like you would test a diode with the multimeter (On diode testing mode) and also get note of the direction of it (this is very important!), if it’s damaged, replace it using the same direction the old had.
If after testing with a GOOD, checked, perfect screen, still doesn’t work, then you can continue down the line and check the coil (It’s never the coil) or the IC, both rarely fail. Just test the coil for continuity and change if needed… And if the coil is ok, and then the IC is the problem… Just… Take it to repair or buy a new Mobo. As reflowing this is too complicated without a lot of experience and good tools.
I hope this helps!
Cheers!
