You Won't Believe the Shocking Truth About Your iPad Air LTE's Cellular Network Connection Issues Under OSX 12.1.3!

If you own an iPad Air LTE and have been experiencing cellular network connection issues on your device since upgrading to OSX 12.1.3, then you're not alone. Many other users have reported similar problems, and there's a shocking truth behind it all.

According to several sources, the issue has arisen due to a bug in the operating system's cellular data settings. Apparently, the "Wi-Fi Assist" option, which is designed to improve internet connectivity on the iPad, has been causing the device to drop LTE signals, and instead, switch to slower 3G or a disconnected state.

Apple designed Wi-Fi assist to keep up a consistent internet experience without interruptions by automatically switching to cellular data when you have a weak Wi-Fi connection. However, this process unintentionally interferes with the LTE network connections, causing iOS 12.1.3 users to experience terrible cellular network experiences.

Despite the numerous reports, Apple hasn't yet provided an official statement refusing to acknowledge the issue or provide a timeline for a fix. And this is unsettling news, given that the problem continues to persist for many users.

The good news is that you can take certain steps to address the connection issues on your iPad Air LTE. Simply turning off the Wi-Fi Assist option can help eliminate the problem temporarily, while more permanent fixes are found.

To disable the Wi-Fi Assist option on your iPad Air LTE, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings app on your device
2. Tap on the "Cellular" option
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and toggle the "Wi-Fi Assist" setting to off

Disabling Wi-Fi Assist ensures that your cellular network connection isn't hampered. It also ensures that the device isn't frequently switching between Wi-Fi and cellular whenever you’re in a weak Wi-Fi location.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing cellular network connectivity issues on your iPad Air LTE, there may be an underlying issue due to the Wi-Fi Assist setting. While Apple is yet to provide a permanent fix to this problem, disabling the Wi-Fi Assist setting is an excellent way to temporarily address the issue. This approach is effective for maintaining a consistent internet experience without any interruptions.

## Chosen Solution
 I had raised this question a week back and may be it was too confusing to attract any notice and draw any answer.  Sorry about that.
The issue is related to ipad air 5 (wifi+lte) with latest osx (12.1.3). I am trying to connect it to the Jio net in India with a Jio 4G SIM card using a “Jio 4GVoice” calling app. I try the following.
·      SIM card is put in the system
·      WIFI is selected (through a personal network)
·      Mobile Data is switched “ON”  (in Settings)
·      Network selection is set to “Automatic
·      LTE is enabled (in Mobile Data options)
Under Settings>General>About  the Carrier is shown as “Jio 35.0 and Network is shown as “Not Available”. Selecting network manually (to Jio4G) has same effect.
 
·      Resetting network and rebooting repeatedly or switching Airplane mode On and Off  has no effect.
·      Change to a different network (AirTel India) has the same effect > Network not available.
·      Followed all steps as suggested in

From various discussions it appears the network data needs to be updated. For Jio it should be Jio 35.1 instead of Jio 35.0. It probably could be set under Profiles & Accounts. Somewhere it is also suggested to change the configuration. But I don’t know how. Thanks.

 From what I see, I’m not even sure if the LTE functionality is working in the first place, or if it is even compatible.
Is it a Model 1475 or 1476?
Do you have any example of working model 1475 or 1476 on given networks?
