Is Your iPod Touch 5 Screen Cracked? This Mind-Blowing Hack Will Save You Hundreds on Repairs!

If you're the proud owner of an iPod Touch 5, you know how frustrating it can be when the screen cracks. It's not just unsightly, it can also impair the touchscreen functionality of your device. But the cost of repairs can be steep – upwards of $100 or more, depending on where you take it. 

However, there's a hack floating around the internet that claims to fix cracked iPod Touch 5 screens for a fraction of the cost. Is it too good to be true? Let's take a closer look.

First, let's talk about how the hack works. It involves using ordinary toothpaste to fill in the cracks on your screen. Apparently, the toothpaste has just the right consistency to smooth out the cracks and make them less visible. Some people also report that the toothpaste can somehow reinforce the screen, making it less likely to crack again in the future. 

So, is this hack actually effective? Well, it depends on the severity of the crack. If it's a small crack or scratch, you might see some improvement. But if your screen is seriously cracked, it's unlikely that toothpaste will be able to fully repair it. Additionally, if you apply too much pressure while buffing the toothpaste onto the screen, you could inadvertently make the crack worse or damage the touchscreen further. 

Overall, while the toothpaste hack might be a useful solution for small cosmetic issues, it's not a long-term fix for serious screen damage. If you rely heavily on your iPod Touch 5, it's probably best to take it to a professional repair shop to get the problem addressed properly. 

That said, there are a few things you can do to prevent your screen from cracking in the first place. One is to invest in a quality screen protector – these can absorb some of the impact in case your device falls. You can also purchase a protective case to help cushion your iPod Touch 5. 

In conclusion, while the toothpaste hack might be an interesting experiment, it's not a reliable fix for serious screen damage. If your device is vital to your everyday life, it's worth considering a professional repair or taking preventative measures to protect your screen.

## Chosen Solution
 I dropped My iPod touch a while ago but i remembered i had pictures from a trip on it so i tried to transfer  them onto my computer. I couldn’t because my screen was popping out and i had many lines going through it. I couldnt enter my password anymore. Can i do anything to fix the screen?

 You could try replacing the display:
iPod Touch 5th Generation Display Assembly Replacement
But it does say it's difficult to carry out. I'm sure there would be someone in your area who can do the repair for you, then you'd be able to get your photos off and have a working iPod again!
