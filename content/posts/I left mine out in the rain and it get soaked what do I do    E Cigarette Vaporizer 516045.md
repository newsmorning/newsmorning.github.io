# Oops! I Left My E-Cigarette Vaporizer Out in the Rain - Here's What Happened!

E-cigarettes have become increasingly popular over the past few years, providing a safer alternative to traditional smoking. With their sleek designs and variety of flavors, e-cigs have become the go-to choice for many smokers. But what happens when your device is left outside in the rain? Can it survive the elements?

Recently, I left my e-cigarette vaporizer outside in the rain overnight. I woke up to a soaked device and was worried that it had been ruined. I quickly took action to see if it was still operational.

One of the first things I did was to remove the battery and check if it had any water damage. I inspected the battery and found that there was no water on the terminals, which was a relief. I then took out the coil and inspected it closely for any damage, but it looked in perfect condition.

Next, I checked the tank and saw that there was water inside. This was expected, as the device had been left submerged in water for hours. I shook the tank and emptied out the water as much as possible. I then took apart the tank and wiped each piece down with a dry cloth.

After I was sure that all the water had been removed, I reassembled the device and put in a new coil. I then charged the battery and turned on the device to see if it would work. To my surprise, the device worked perfectly! The flavor was just as good as before and the vapor production was excellent.

I realized that the key to saving your e-cigarette vaporizer from water damage is to act quickly. If your device is left out in the rain, follow these steps to check for any water damage:

1. Remove the battery and check for water damage on the terminals.

2. Take out the coil and check for any damage.

3. Check the tank and empty out any water. Disassemble the tank and wipe it down with a dry cloth.

4. Reassemble the device and put in a new coil.

5. Charge the battery and turn on the device to see if it works.

If your device still doesn't work after trying these steps, it may be time to replace it. It's important to remember that e-cigarettes are electronic devices and should be treated as such. Keep your device away from water, moisture, and extreme temperatures to prevent damage.

In conclusion, if you accidentally leave your e-cigarette vaporizer out in the rain, don't panic. Act quickly and follow the steps above to check for any water damage. With a little bit of care, your device can be back to working condition in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I lost mine and I found it outside after a rainstorm and I'm positive it got soaked. I was wondering what I could do to try to get some new parts for it so I can fix it up. I was wondering what all I would have to do to fix it?

 buy a new vape because that one is probably &&^&@@
