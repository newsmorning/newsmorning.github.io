Title: You Won't Believe the Shocking Reason Why This Red Line is Taking Over Your TV Screen!

Opening Statement:
For years, people have been enjoying the wonderful world of TV, filled with many different programs and channels. However, people have been noticing the appearance of a red line that slowly invades their screens over time. It seems to come out of nowhere and takes over the entire TV, causing inconvenience to many viewers. But what is the reason for this red line? Is it a technical malfunction, or is there something more sinister happening behind the scenes?

Introduction:
The TV has become a staple of modern life, providing viewers with hours of entertainment and information. The last thing anyone wants is for their enjoyment to be interrupted by a red line that slowly takes over the screen. This is a common problem, but many people don't know what is behind it. In this article, we will explore the shocking reason why this red line is taking over your TV screen.

The Cause:
The red line that appears on your TV screen is actually a phenomenon known as "burn-in." It occurs when a particular image or color is displayed on the screen for too long. The pixels in that part of the screen wear out faster than the rest, and this results in a permanent line that remains on the screen. This is most common on older plasma and CRT TVs, but even modern OLED and LCD TVs are not immune to it.

The culprit behind the burn-in is the "channel logo." Many channels have their logos burned in on the top left or right corner of the screen. These logos are usually present throughout the entire broadcast, and if you watch that channel for an extended period, the image will be "burned" onto the screen. This is why the red line takes over your TV screen, as it is the result of the channel logo causing burn-in.

The Consequence:
The long-term effects of burn-in can be detrimental to the lifespan of the TV. The burned-in image remains on the screen even when switching channels, and it can be distracting to the viewer. The constant display of the same image or color can lead to the TV screen aging faster than usual. This means that the TV will have a shorter lifespan compared to other TVs that do not suffer from burn-in.

The Solution:
The best way to prevent burn-in is to avoid long-term exposure to a particular image or color. However, this is not always possible, especially if you are watching your favorite program. One temporary solution to prevent burn-in is by enabling the "screen saver" feature on your TV. This feature displays a moving image on the screen when there is no input source, preventing any static image from being displayed on the screen for too long.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the red line that takes over your TV screen is a result of the channel logo causing burn-in. The best way to prevent this is to avoid long-term exposure to a particular image, but it is not always possible. However, enabling the "screen saver" feature on your TV can help prevent burn-in and ensure that your TV screen will last longer. So next time you see the red line taking over your TV screen, you know what is causing it and how to prevent it!

## Chosen Solution
 I have a 32 inch element that has a red line running  vertical right in the center. Any help would be greatly appreciated because we're moving and can't avoid another TV at the moment

 @mitchell52 single lines are usually related to a failed source TAB. That is where the orange flat ribbon cable  that are bonded to the panel come loose and make no contact. you can try to apply some light pressure on the ribbon cable right where that line is. If it disappears it is a failed bond. Usually not a DIY repair but sometimes applying pressure with some good tape can help.
Add some pictures of what your display shows so we can see what you see. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that. Also, what exact model is your TV
