While it promises to promote better learning and collaboration, it also comes with strict control from the administrators. A desperate student noted that he could not escape the admin control on his school-issued HP Chromebook 14, and he wonders if there is any hope to gain control over it.\nThe HP Chromebook 14 is a popular device among schools because of its easy navigation, low price point, and Google apps options. However, when it comes to the strict admin control, it becomes more like a ball and chain than a helpful tool. Students are limited in what they can access and what they can do without the admin’s permission, making it difficult to use the device for personal use or anything beyond academic research.\nThe desperate student in question shared his predicament. He is a college student who uses the HP Chromebook 14 for his daily academic work. With the lockdown in place because of the pandemic, he had to rely on the device for entertainment as well. He stated that “I cannot do anything; it’s like living in an information jail.” He elaborated that sites like Netflix, YouTube, and other entertainment channels are blocked by the admin, and there is no way he can access them without permission.\nMoreover, he expressed that it is difficult to work on projects outside of school with the same device because of the admin control. With so many restrictions, the HP Chromebook 14 feels like an incomplete device that hampers productivity and creativity.\nSo, is there any hope for HP Chromebook 14 users to gain control over their devices?\nThe answer is complicated. The admin control is intentionally challenging to navigate through, and it is challenging to bypass security protocols. However, there is a workaround for a few features that the student can access without the admin’s permission.\nOne of the ways to bypass admin control is by installing an External Hosted Network. It is a third-party network that allows the user to browse the internet without the admin blocking anything. However, this involves some know-how and technical expertise, and if the school catches wind of it, there might be repercussions.\nThe other way is to use a virtual private network (VPN). VPN services let you connect to the internet through a private network, masking your online activity from your school and your ISP. It can also bypass the admin restriction, but, again, this workaround can get you into trouble with the school administration.\nIn conclusion, gaining control over the HP Chromebook 14 is a challenging feat, and it requires some technical knowledge to get around the admin’s control. However, there are a few workarounds for a few features that the user can access without causing trouble. For the student, it boils down to how badly he or she wants to gain full control over the device and if the consequences are worth it.\nThe best way to go about it is to talk to the school administration and discuss the limitations that come with the device. They might be able to provide some flexibility and unblock some required sites or apps. And if the situation warrants it, you can always invest in your device that comes with a different operating system that provides more control and flexibility.\nChosen Solution So I have a question as well I have admin on my school cromebook and I don’t know how to get it off can you please help me?\nIf your school has admin access to your Chromebook, only they have the ability to remove it. Even if you did remove it (you can’t), they would know because they monitor their equipment for tampering.\nyou need to access the main device and remove the admin rights for your chromebook. that’s the only way. Wait until the supervisor is out, and then modify the accesses. By the way, there is one more lifehack.
