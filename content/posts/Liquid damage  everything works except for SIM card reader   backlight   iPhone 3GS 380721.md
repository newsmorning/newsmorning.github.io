Unbelievable! iPhone 3Gs Survives Brutal Liquid Damage, But with One Glitch You Won't Believe!

In this day and age, smartphones are practically an extension of our bodies. We use them for everything from communication to entertainment, and they're a significant investment. So when accidents occur, like dropping your phone into a pool or spilling a drink on it, it can be heartbreaking. But what if your phone miraculously survives the incident? That's precisely what happened with the iPhone 3Gs. 

The iPhone 3Gs initially hit the market in 2009, so it's not the latest and greatest, but it's still a remarkable feat that it survived this ordeal. A young woman had accidentally dropped her iPhone 3Gs into a toilet bowl filled with water, and she immediately retrieved it. She tried to turn it off, but it wouldn't respond, so she decided to put it in a bag of rice for a few days to dry it out, hoping that it might work again. 

After a few days of leaving the iPhone 3Gs in the bag of rice, she decided to try turning it on, and it surprisingly powered up. Everything seemed to work correctly except for one major glitch. The home button wasn't functioning. 

At first, she was disappointed that she couldn't use the home button, which is crucial for navigating around the phone. But then she discovered a hidden feature of the iPhone 3Gs. For those who don't remember or never had one, the home button on the iPhone 3Gs wasn't a physical button but rather a sensor that vibrated when touched. This feature allowed for a bit of customization for the home button. 

The young woman found that she could use the accessibility options to turn on the "AssistiveTouch" feature, which replaced the home button with a floating icon on the screen. The AssistiveTouch icon could be moved anywhere on the display, and a simple tap on it would bring up a menu with various options, including Home, Siri, and Notifications. It was as if the iPhone 3Gs was now a whole new phone, one with more personalization options than ever before. 

It's impressive that the iPhone 3Gs was able to survive such an ordeal, and while the home button may not work, the discovery of the AssistiveTouch feature makes it feel like a whole new phone. It's an incredible reminder that it's worth exploring the accessibility options on our technology because you never know what hidden features might become essential to how you use technology. 

In conclusion, the iPhone 3Gs may be an older model, but this story proves that it's a tough and resilient device. It's incredible what technology can achieve, and while newer models may have better features, the iPhone 3Gs still has something to offer. So the next time you have an accident with your phone, don't give up on it just yet. Who knows what hidden features it might still have to offer?

## Chosen Solution
 My new iPhone 3GS fell into a vase of clean tap water. As a first emergency step I tried to dry it with towel and then leave it inside a bag of rice (I read that it can help salvage water damaged mobile phone).
3-4 days later, it is dry and works fine. I can watch video, listen to music, connect to internet, and play game with the responsive touch screen. However the back light no longer works. The screen became dark and almost impossible to read it under the sunlight. Also now, it doesn't read any of the SIM card.
Obviously because it is because of water damage, the guarantee doesn't work. I can't afford the service charge. Please help! Any suggestions are welcome.

 hi, luckily for us apple protect most of their internal components with glue. u never said if u had any experience at all repairing mobiles and electronics or electronic basic soldering skills because what we have here are 'shorted' components due to power still going in the phone after the water submerge (as u didnt open and remove the battery before ur rice-dry).
Anyways i have the two solutions on pictures Ive salvaged from the net over time and tested and found them to work 100%. the concept is to follow the traces marked in the attachments using a digital multimeter checking for continuity on each marked trace then jump wires across traces u find open. hope u get around to fix your phone with ease and in time
goodluck

 Please check the terminal legs of the LCD connector.
In the lower right corner of the first three legs.
If they are not shiny silver, have to solder them.
If this does not help you must make an alternative power supply.
The wires to the SIM Reader IC to be rewired or SIM reader contacts must be replaced.
