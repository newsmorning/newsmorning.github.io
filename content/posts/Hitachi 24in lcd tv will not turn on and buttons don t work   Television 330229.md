Is Your Hitachi 24In LCD TV DEAD? Learn Why It Won't Turn On and Its Buttons Are Useless!

If you own a Hitachi 24In LCD TV and it has stopped turning on or responding to button commands, you are not alone. Thousands of people have reported similar issues with their Hitachi TVs, and while these problems can be frustrating, they are often fixable.

Here are some common reasons why your Hitachi 24In LCD TV may not be turning on and its buttons may be useless:

1. Power Supply Issues:

One of the most common reasons why a Hitachi TV won't turn on is because of power supply issues. Like any other electronic device, the TV requires a stable flow of electricity to function properly. If there is a problem with the power supply (either at the outlet or in the TV), the TV may not turn on, or it may turn on briefly before shutting back off.

If you suspect this is the issue, try unplugging the TV from the wall outlet and waiting a few minutes before plugging it back in. This can help reset the power supply and may resolve the issue.

2. Faulty Remote Control:

Another reason why your Hitachi 24In LCD TV may not be turning on is because of a faulty remote control. If the TV appears to be receiving power but it is not responding to button commands, the remote may be the culprit.

Try replacing the batteries in the remote or purchasing a new one. If this does not solve the problem, you may need to replace the TV's IR sensor, which is the part that receives signals from the remote.

3. Malfunctioning Circuit Board:

A malfunctioning circuit board can also cause your Hitachi TV to stop working or respond to commands. This issue can be difficult to diagnose without professional assistance, as there are several circuit boards in the TV that could be causing the problem.

If you suspect this is the issue, you may need to take your TV to a professional repair shop for diagnostics and repairs.

4. Overheating:

Overheating can also cause your Hitachi 24In LCD TV to stop functioning properly. Like any electronic device, the TV generates heat during use, and if it is not properly vented, this heat can build up and cause damage.

Make sure that your TV is placed in a well-ventilated area and that there is plenty of space around it. If you suspect overheating is the issue, try turning the TV off and unplugging it for a few hours to allow it to cool down.

In conclusion, if your Hitachi 24In LCD TV won't turn on or its buttons are useless, there are several potential reasons why this might be happening. By troubleshooting the issue yourself, you may be able to avoid costly repairs or replacements. However, if the problem persists, it is recommended that you seek professional assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 I got a Hitachi 24in lcd flat screen. When I plug it in there is a red light in lower left side. I’ve unplugged it and held power button in for over 15 seconds then plug back in. That didn’t help, I held in the power and input button to get to service screen that didn’t work. I put new batteries in the remote that didn’t work. There’s no wires hooked up to it right now. What else can I do?

sounds like a power board issue. remove the back from your TV and check the fuses and power-in- line on your power board with a meter. Let us know what you find. you also want to let us know what exact model your TV is.
