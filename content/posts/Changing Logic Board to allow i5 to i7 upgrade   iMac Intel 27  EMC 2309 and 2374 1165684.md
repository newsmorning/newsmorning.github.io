Unlocking the True Potential of Your iMac: The Secret Hack to Upgrade from i5 to i7 Inside!

If you're an iMac user, then you're probably already familiar with the powerful performance offered by these computers. However, what you might not realize is that there's a secret hack that can take your iMac to the next level. By upgrading from an i5 processor to an i7, you can unlock even more potential from your device.

Here's everything you need to know about upgrading your iMac's processor.

Why Upgrade to an i7 Processor?

First, let's discuss why upgrading to an i7 processor is beneficial. In short, an i7 processor is simply more powerful than an i5. It allows your computer to process more information at a faster rate, which results in smoother performance and faster processing times.

Some of the benefits you can expect from upgrading to an i7 include:

• Faster overall performance
• Quicker load times for applications and programs
• Increased processing power for CPU-intensive tasks
• Better multitasking capabilities

How to Upgrade Your iMac Processor

Now that you understand the benefits of upgrading to an i7, you may be wondering how to go about actually making the switch. While it's not a simple process, it is possible with the right tools and expertise.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

Step 1: Check Compatibility

Before you start any upgrades, you'll need to make sure your iMac is compatible with an i7 processor. Check the specifications of your model to confirm that it can handle the upgrade.

Step 2: Back Up Your Data

Whenever you make major changes to your computer, it's always a good idea to back up your data first. You don't want to lose any important files or documents in case something goes wrong during the upgrade process.

Step 3: Buy an i7 Processor

Once you've determined that your iMac is compatible with an i7 processor, it's time to purchase one. You can find these processors for sale online or at electronics stores.

Step 4: Remove the Old Processor

Now comes the tricky part. You'll need to open up your iMac and remove the old processor. This can be a delicate process, so if you're not experienced with computer repairs, it may be best to hire a professional to do it for you.

Step 5: Install the New Processor

After removing the old processor, it's time to install the new one. This process is essentially the reverse of removing the old processor, but it still requires a steady hand and attention to detail.

Step 6: Test Your iMac

Once the new processor is installed, it's time to turn on your iMac and test it out. If everything went smoothly, you should notice a significant improvement in performance and speed.

Conclusion

Upgrading your iMac from an i5 to an i7 processor can be a game-changer for anyone who needs top-tier performance from their computer. While the process isn't easy, it's certainly worth the effort for those who demand the best from their devices.

If you're not comfortable with making this upgrade yourself, don't hesitate to seek out a professional to help you. And when you're ready to get started, be sure to follow all necessary precautions to protect your data and your device during the process. Good luck!

## Chosen Solution
 So I've read a lot about this matter and it appears that upgrading a (Late 2009) 27in iMac Duo Core to a quad core i5/i7 is pretty much a no go. My question then is, could you replace the logic board inside and still run everything smoothly, seeing as it is an available option for this model.
Best,
Marcin

 A bit late to the party, but maybe it is still helpful:
I did exactly what you were looking to do - upgrading form the lower Core2Duo board to the i5 board (the board should be the same as the i7 board, as other people have successfully upgraded just the CPU on the i5 board to an i7). It works without problems so far.
I took the board from a working i5 model with several other defects (not related to the board of course). Disassembling was not complicated, but took a lot of time because I was too cautious. If you follow the teardown guide and use a bit of force for some of the plastic parts which stick to the back of the case (around the PSU, CPU heatsink and LED board), then you should be fine.
It is easy if you do it in the correct order:
1) glass panel, display, display cables (look at the guides)
2) graphics card, hard disk, optical drive, optical fan and all their cables (not needed, but makes room for the PSU and makes everything easier)
3) mark all cables from the board with (colored) labels to not forget them later (optional) and remove them (required)
4) disconnect and remove LED driver board; remove PSU board (PSU can also be just flipped around into the empty hard disk space if you don't like to mess with the cables)
5) remove CPU fan and the infrared sensor (look at the guides)
6) now you can carefully remove the logicboard including heatsink and change it for your replacement i5 board. I also reapplied thermal paste in this step, but it is a bit harder to hold board and heatsink and to get the screws right. I would recommend getting another person to hold the parts together, it is much easier this way.
7) reassemble in reverse order, paying attention to all the small cables
Some things I noted:
- The i5 board has an additional port named "SKIN TEMP" (Apple part 922-9287) which goes around the hard disk fan (along with the ground wire), then under the PSU and up to the case near the camera, where the sensor is fixed with a little black pad. I did install it from the second machine, but I do not see it in any temperature monitoring tool and I honestly don't know if it is required at all.
- With the C2D board, the maximum fan speed for the CPU fan was about 4500, now with the new board and the same fan it is only about 2000. The other fans did not change.
- CPU temperatures are around 45 to 50 degree Celsius when idle and up to 75 to 80 under load with CPU fan at full speed. It does feel very hot to the touch, but I did not check before taking it apart, so that may be subjective.
- As others already noted, 32 GB of memory are possible in contrast to the 16 GB maximum of the C2D.
- The board contains the serial number of the machine, but I guess up to this point all AppleCare contracts have already run out, so this does not matter anymore.
So if you can get hold of a board or spare parts iMac with the board for cheap and if you like taking apart things, I would definitely recommend doing it. The upgrade takes a bit of time, but is not that difficult if you are careful to not rip out any cables. And with a i5 or i7 quad core, 32 GB RAM, one or two SSDs and maybe even a newer graphics card from the 2011 models it is possible to prolong the life of this very nice machine for a few more years, depending on your needs.

 I am currently performing this upgrade from a Core2Duo to an i7-870, swapping out the logicboard.
So.  It boots.  It's alive!
Snags: -
1.  The i7 needs a different heatsink from the Core2Duo.  If you just buy a bare logicboard, as I did, you need to also get hold of the correct heatsink.  Part number 730-0584.  Cost bumped.
2.  Fans running very high RPM and loud.
3.  CPU running very slow.  Despite now being shown as an i7 2.93GHz under About This Mac.  Geekbench gives 32bit single core ~900 and multicore ~3000.  Hardly an improvement so far.
I too eventually noticed the new connector on the new logicboard for a "Skin Temp" sensor.  Not present on previous logicboard.  Running Apple Hardware Test gives the following error 4SNS/1/C0000008:TS2P--124.  In the Apple Technician Guide (imac_27_late09.pdf) this means "Skin temp sensor (Quad-core models only) is damaged or disconnected from top of logic board."
I tried shorting the skin temp connector with some bare wire.  Nasty, and did not work.
Going to try to get hold of a sensor.  I'm hoping the heat misinformation is throttling the CPU.  About 30quid.  Cost bumped again.

 If you stay within the same model number you usually have no problems.

 Updated an iMac 27” Core Duo 2009 with new Motherboard and CPU. Now running a i7 CPU with no fault.
All you have to do is replace the old MB952LL/A CoreDuo CPU with the new MB953LL/A i7 CPU, also need < SKIN TEMP 922-9287 cable and new  heatsink part number 730-0584 that fit this version instead of the 730-0567 A.
Thanks to all of you.

 Thanks so much for your post, hd22. Very helpful indeed!
I am still considering doing this upgrade myself one day, it was just great to finally get confirmation that it can be done!

 Swapping logic boards looks cheaper and less wasteful than buying new computers.
This is relevant in 2018 because macOS Mojave relies on particular graphics processors for its “Metal” graphics  language (as they dropped support for OpenGL).  Us oldies must search for post-2012 graphics boards.

 I assume that OP has the same type of machine as I do, namely a 27" with one of the Core 2 Duo processors - the EMC 2309 model.
However the late 2009 iMacs with i5 and i7 processors are the EMC 2374 model.
So we are talking about taking the logic board from one model and putting it in a different, though presumably very closely related model. I'm not so confident to assume that such a cross-model upgrade will be problem-free...
I'm willing to shell out the cash to buy a new logic board and graphics card - it's almost embarrassing that my 27" beast is barely more powerful than my late 2009 MacBook Pro! ;)
But has anybody actually done this successfully?

 I would be very interest to know this is possible also.  I have a 2309 that needs a new logic board so it would be awesome to throw in an i7.

 I really want to do this as well! What model/year logic board did you go with? I want to put in a 24" early 2009

 I have a 2011 iMac running as a monitor from my Mac mini, using the Thunderbolt cable. If the old iMacs have a Thunderbolt socket, you can defer the physical upgrade.
