Is Your Ford Escape Key Fob Dying? Here's the Ultimate Guide to Fixing it - Save Hundreds on Repairs!

If you own a Ford Escape, you know how essential the key fob is. It allows you to lock and unlock the doors, start the car, and even open the trunk. However, if your key fob starts to die, it can be a major inconvenience. Instead of spending a lot of money on repairs or replacements, you can fix your key fob with a few simple steps.

Step 1 - Change the Battery

The first step to fixing a dying key fob is to check the battery. Over time, the battery can wear down and stop working. Changing the battery is easy and can be done in a few minutes. First, remove the key fob's back cover using a small screwdriver. Then, take out the old battery and replace it with a new one. Finally, reattach the back cover and test the key fob.

Step 2 - Re-Synchronize the Key Fob

If changing the battery did not work, the next step is to re-synchronize the key fob with the car. This step is necessary if the key fob is not sending the right signals to the car. To re-synchronize the key fob, stand close to the car and press the "lock" button on the key fob five times within ten seconds. Then, press the "unlock" button on the key fob. The car's doors should now unlock, and the key fob should be synced.

Step 3 - Check the Circuit Board

If the previous two steps did not fix the key fob, the next step is to check the circuit board. Over time, the circuit board can become dirty or corroded, causing the key fob to malfunction. To check the circuit board, remove the back cover of the key fob again. Then, carefully clean the circuit board with a soft cloth and some rubbing alcohol. If you see any corrosion or damage, replace the circuit board entirely.

Step 4 - Replace the Key Fob

If none of the previous steps worked, it's time to replace the key fob entirely. You'll need to order a new key fob from the manufacturer, but replacing it yourself will save you hundreds of dollars in repairs. You can even program the key fob yourself using the car's manual.

In conclusion, fixing a dying Ford Escape key fob is easy and can be done in a few simple steps. Instead of spending money on repairs or replacements, try changing the battery, re-synchronizing the key fob, checking the circuit board, or replacing the key fob yourself. Not only will you save money, but you'll also have a working key fob in no time.

Good job. The training aid was clear and lacked nothing.  Even had the battery type and a buy function which is a nice touch.

How can you find a replacement ignition key?   I have the fob, but the ignition key is nowhere to be found, didn't notice it missing on our spare from the dealer until recently.
