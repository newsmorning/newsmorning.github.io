Is Your Retina Display iMac Dead? The Shocking Reason Behind A1419 No Diagnostic LED After NVMe SSD Replacement Will Blow Your Mind!

If you have recently replaced the NVMe SSD in your Retina iMac A1419 and are facing an issue where the diagnostic LED is not turning on, then you are not alone. This problem has been reported by many iMac users, and most of them are left wondering what went wrong since they had followed the instructions carefully.

The truth is that this problem is not caused by a faulty SSD or an error in the installation process. The real culprit behind the A1419 no diagnostic LED problem after NVMe SSD replacement lies in the design of the iMac itself.

Let's take a closer look at why this happens.

The A1419 model of the Retina iMac comes with an internal diagnostic LED that is supposed to light up when the computer is turned on. This LED is located near the RAM slots and is supposed to indicate the status of the system during the boot-up process.

However, when you replace the NVMe SSD, you are required to detach the display assembly from the iMac. This can cause the connector that powers the diagnostic LED to become loose or disconnected altogether.

In other words, the problem with the A1419 no diagnostic LED after NVMe SSD replacement has nothing to do with the SSD itself. It is caused by a design flaw in the iMac that makes it difficult to access the internal components without affecting other parts.

So, what can you do if you find yourself in this situation?

First of all, you should know that your iMac is not dead. It is still possible to fix the problem and get your computer up and running again. Here are a few steps that you can follow:

Step 1: Open up your iMac again and locate the connector that powers the diagnostic LED.

Step 2: Ensure that the connector is plugged in securely and is not loose.

Step 3: Reassemble your iMac and turn it on to see if the diagnostic LED turns on.

If the LED still doesn't turn on, then you may need to seek the help of a professional. There could be other issues with your iMac that are causing the problem, and it may be beyond your ability to fix it yourself.

In conclusion, the A1419 no diagnostic LED problem after NVMe SSD replacement is not something to be worried about. It is a common issue that has been caused by a design flaw in the iMac itself. By following the steps mentioned above, you can get your iMac up and running again in no time. If you are still facing issues, consider contacting a professional.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
Recently I replaced the NVME SSD in A1419 iMac.
Unfortunately, it did not turning on after doing that. I replaced the new PSU, but the same situation. It seems PSU is OK.
AC-DC connector, J600 #4~6, #10~12 are 12V. But 4 diagonostic LEDs in logic board are not turning on.
What shall I do check for the first time?
I want to repair by myself… but not board view file for this model. Please let me know the solution and share the borad view file, if you have.
Thank you!

 I would remove the drive you put in it’s likely bad or shorted out.
Carefully plug things back together without the drive and any adapter does the system boot up now?
If it does then you need to replace the drive elements. I would recommend going with a better drive like OWC Aura Pro X2 SSD
