# Get Lit: The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide to Revamping Your 2014 Subaru Forester Headlights!

The headlight is one of the most crucial parts of a car. And while you probably think that you can just buy a new one when the first one becomes dim, replacing headlights can be quite costly. Luckily, you don’t have to dig deep into your pockets to give your 2014 Subaru Forester headlights a facelift. With the right materials and tools, you can refurbish your headlights to look brand new, making your car safer and more stylish on the road.

Here is the ultimate step-by-step guide to revamping your 2014 Subaru Forester headlights:

## Materials:

- Automotive Grade Sandpaper (800, 1000, and 2000 grit)
- Buffing Wheel

- Headlight Restoration Compound
- Microfiber Towel
- Water
- Masking Tape
- Wax or Sealant

## Step 1: Preparation

Before you start the restoration process, make sure that you park your car in a shaded area. This will prevent the headlight restoration compound from drying up too fast in the sun. You also want to ensure that the headlights are free from any dirt, grime, or loose debris. You can use a damp microfiber towel to clean the surface of the headlight.

Once your headlights are clean, cover the edges of the headlights with masking tape to protect the paint around the light.

## Step 2: Sanding

Start with 800-grit sandpaper to clear out any rough spots or oxidized areas on your headlights. Don’t apply too much pressure as this can scratch the surface. You only need to do this for about five minutes.

After the first stage of sanding, use 1000-grit sandpaper to smoothen any scratch marks left from the previous step. Sand gently, making sure not to leave any deep scratches. Add a bit of water to help with the sanding process.

Finally, use 2000-grit sandpaper to create a smooth, shiny finish. Make sure that the sandpaper is wet at all times for proper results.

## Step 3: Buffing and Polishing

Connect the buffing wheel to your drill and apply the headlight restoration compound to the surface of the lens. Use a reasonable speed (not too fast or slow) to avoid causing any heat damage to the headlight. The compound should be allowed to dry before buffing.

Once you have buffed one side of the headlight, wipe it down with a microfiber towel to check that you have covered all areas. Repeat the process on the other headlight.

## Step 4: Waxing

Finally, once you have finished buffing and polishing the headlights, you can improve their shine and longevity by waxing them. Use a good quality wax or sealant to coat the headlight. This will protect the plastic from further UV damage, ensuring that the clear coat remains protected and the headlights remain bright.

In conclusion, revamping your 2014 Subaru Forester headlights is a straightforward process that will save you money and improve the safety and aesthetics of your car. With these simple steps, you can get lit in no time!
