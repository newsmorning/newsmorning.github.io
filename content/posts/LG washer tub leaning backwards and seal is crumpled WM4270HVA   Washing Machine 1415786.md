Is Your LG Washer a Ticking Time Bomb? The Shocking Truth About the WM4270HVA Model's Dangerous Tub Lean and Crumpled Seal!

LG have always been known for their innovative and technology-driven home electronics. They have been constantly evolving their products to cater to the changing needs of their customers. Another area where they have been successful is with their washing machines with the LG WM4270HVA being one of their popular models.

However, the WM4270HVA model has not been without its fair share of problems, which have left many customers surprised and frustrated. The machine has had a reputation for having a dangerous tub lean and crumpled seal, which put users at risk of injury and their clothes getting damaged as well.

The problem with the LG WM4270HVA is that its tub is poorly designed and balanced, causing it to lean to one side during a wash cycle. That means that the heavy metal drum that supports the clothes inside can quickly become unstable, with serious consequences. If the drum becomes too unbalanced, it can start to bang against the sides of the machine violently. This not only damages the drum, but it can also cause the washing machine to move around. In worst cases, it could even tip over.

The positioning of the tub is not the only problem that the LG WM4270HVA has faced. The washer's seal has also caused some frustrating issues for users. Over time, the seal that keeps water inside the machine can start to crumple or deform. This can lead to leaks, water damage, and mold forming inside the washer.

Unfortunately, these issues have been causing problems for LG customers for years, and some have even led to lawsuits. The company has acknowledged the problem with the WM4270HVA model and released a service bulletin to address it. It is also offering repair services, but the process can be slow, and not all customers have been satisfied with the results.

If you own an LG WM4270HVA washing machine, it is essential to be aware of these problems and take steps to ensure your safety. First, inspect the tub of your machine to see if it leans to one side. If it does, you should consider getting it serviced or replaced immediately. Secondly, monitor the seal of your machine for signs of crumpling or deformations, and have it replaced if necessary.

In conclusion, the LG WM4270HVA model has been a contentious issue over the years, with users experiencing dangerous tub leans and crumpled seals. While LG has tried to address the issue, it still persists, and users should be cautious in using these machines. If you own one, be vigilant about checking the balance of the tub and the condition of the seal to ensure your safety and your clothes' health.


## Chosen Solution
 So I bought this washer used. I don’t have any insight into its history. But I took the top off and it looks pretty clean on the inside. However, It has this weird issue that I cannot for the life of me figure out.
If you look into the washer the seal between the tub and front panel looks crumpled. After taking the top of the washer off I was able to grab the tub and pull the top part of the tub toward me. When I do that I can get the seal to be mostly uncrumpled. If I pull the top of the tub toward the front of the washer and I reach inside the door and push the bottom of the tub slightly away from the door.  The seal starts to look much better.
The 2 springs on the sides look fine but I’m not sure what to look at next as I can’t see anything else that should cause the tub to sit differently.
Help, please.

 jeff hicken   besides the two springs your washer should also have three dampers in the back. Check those to make sure they are still fully connected and in good working order.
