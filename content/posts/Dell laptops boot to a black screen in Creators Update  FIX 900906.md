If you own a Dell laptop and recently upgraded to the Creators Update, you may be experiencing a frustrating problem: your computer won't boot up properly. The good news is that there is a quick and easy fix for this issue, and it all has to do with a driver update that was included in the Creators Update.

First, let's discuss why this problem is occurring. After the Creators Update was installed, some Dell laptops began experiencing issues with the Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) driver. This driver is responsible for managing the storage devices in your computer, and if it's not working properly, it can cause a variety of problems – including the inability to boot up your computer.

Thankfully, the solution to this problem is relatively simple. Dell has released a new version of the RST driver that is compatible with the Creators Update, and all you need to do is install it. Here's how:

1. Go to the Dell support website (support.dell.com) and enter your computer's service tag or model number.

2. Navigate to the "Drivers and Downloads" section and find the "Intel Rapid Storage Technology" driver.

3. Download and install the latest version of the driver that is compatible with the Creators Update.

4. Restart your computer and check to see if the issue has been resolved.

It's important to note that some users may not be able to install the new driver because their computer won't boot up at all. If this is the case, you can try booting your computer in safe mode and installing the new driver from there. Here's how:

1. Power on your computer and immediately start tapping F8 until you see the Advanced Boot Options screen.

2. Select "Safe Mode with Networking" and press Enter.

3. Once your computer has booted up in safe mode, go to the Dell support website and follow the steps outlined above to download and install the new RST driver.

4. Restart your computer and check to see if the issue has been resolved.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing boot problems with your Dell laptop after the Creators Update, the culprit is likely the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver. By downloading and installing the latest version of the driver from the Dell support website, you can quickly and easily fix the issue and get your computer up and running again.

### How to fix black screen after boot on the Creators Update
 
The black screen is caused by a known issue with the GeForce display driver used in these laptops models and the Creators Update.
 
My computer update last night to the Creator’s Update and this morning I have a black screen with only the mouse cursor. It appears as though everything is there on my desktop, the cursor change changes to a single click finger when over an icon and I can type something in the ask me anything area. (cannot see what I am typing).
 
To fix this problem, you can download and install the GeForce driver hotfix that NVIDIA has released to address this issue. You can download the hotfix from NVIDIA’s support page.
 
The updated display driver is also being released to these devices through Windows Update.
