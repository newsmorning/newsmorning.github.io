Are you frustrated with your Windows 10 default printer constantly changing? Do you find yourself manually selecting your printer each time you need to print a document? If so, you're not alone, as many Windows 10 users have reported similar issues. In this article, we'll discuss some common causes of this problem and how to fix it.

## What Causes the Default Printer to Change?

There are several reasons why Windows 10 may change your default printer without your consent. Here are some common causes:

### Software Updates
Sometimes, software updates can cause your default printer to change. This can happen if the update changes the driver for your printer or if it installs a new printer.

### Network Connectivity Issues
If your printer is connected to a network, connectivity issues can cause your default printer to change. For example, if your printer loses its connection to the network or if the printer's IP address changes, Windows may automatically switch to a different default printer.

### Multiple Printers Installed
If you have multiple printers installed on your computer, Windows may switch to a different printer as the default. This can happen if you use a different printer than the default to print a document or if you install a new printer.

## How to Fix the Default Printer Issue

Fortunately, there are several ways to fix the default printer issue in Windows 10. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:

### Step 1: Check Your Default Printer Settings
The first thing you should do is check your default printer settings. Open the Settings app by clicking on the Start menu and selecting Settings. Then click on Devices > Printers & Scanners. Make sure that the correct printer is selected as the default.

### Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Printers
If you have multiple printers installed on your computer, try removing the ones you don't use. To do this, go to Devices > Printers & Scanners, then select the printer you want to remove and click on Remove device.

### Step 3: Update Printer Drivers
If your default printer keeps changing, it may be due to outdated or corrupted printer drivers. To update your printer drivers, go to Devices > Printers & Scanners, then select the printer and click on Manage > Printer properties. From there, click on the General tab and then click on the Update Driver button.

### Step 4: Disable Let Windows Manage My Default Printer
If Windows keeps changing your default printer, you can try disabling the "Let Windows manage my default printer" option. To do this, go to Devices > Printers & Scanners, then click on the "Let Windows manage my default printer" toggle switch to turn it off.

## Conclusion

The default printer issue in Windows 10 can be frustrating, but fortunately, there are several ways to fix it. By following the troubleshooting steps we've outlined above, you can ensure that your default printer stays the same and that you can print your documents without any hassle.

## Default Printer Keeps Changing in Windows 10
 
In earlier versions of Windows, the default printer was selected based on the Network to which the computer is connected.
 
This feature is no longer available in Windows 10, which now tends to set default printer based on the most recently used printer at a particular location.
 
However, you can easily prevent the default printer from switching on your computer by preventing Windows 10 from managing the Default Printer on your computer.
 
### 1. Do Not Allow Windows to Manage Default Printer
 
1. Go to Settings > Devices.
 
2. On the next screen, select Printers & Scanners in the left-pane. In the right-pane, scroll down and uncheck Let Windows manage my default printerÂ option.
 
3. Scroll up on the same screen, select the Printer that you want to set as default and click on Manage.
 
4. On the next screen, click on Set as Default button.
 
After this, you should no longer find the default printer changing on your computer.
 
### 2. Use Registry to Prevent Default Printer From Switching
 
Another way to prevent the default printer from switching on your computer is by using the Registry Editor.
 
You can use this method, if you are unable to use the first method or if you find the default printer changing, even after using the first method.
 
1. Open the Run Command on your computer.
 
2. In the Run Command window, type regedit and click on OK.
 
3. On Registry Editor screen, navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows.
 
4. Click on Windows Folder in the left-pane. In right-pane, double-click on LegacyDefaultPrinterMode key.
 
5. On the pop-up, change value of LegacyDefaultPrinterMode from default 0 to 1.
 
6. Click on OK to save this change on your computer.
 
This should prevent Windows 10 from changing the default printer on your computer.
