Advantages of a high-performance processor:
 
- Performs simple tasks more quickly
 - Performs well even for demanding applications
 - Multitasking capabilities
 - High-quality gaming experience

 
### Multiple Core Processors
 
Nowadays, most of our devices contain Octa-core or Quad-core processors.  The most important component is the core that reads and performs operations on data. Devices started with single-core processors. Later on, engineers produced powerful processors by including more cores in a single device. This introduced dual-core devices. Then Quad-core processors (four cores) thus emerged. Today there are Hexa-core (six cores) and Octa-core (eight cores) processors for tablets and mobile devices.
 
#### Advantages of Multiple Cores
 
If your system has many cores, it can split the work you’re requesting your device to do. So, the advantage is that your applications perform faster on your gadget. You can capture HD (high-definition) photographs and videos and smoothly play them if your device has a good processor.
 
#### Is an Octa-core processor twice as powerful as a Quad-core one?
 
No, an Octa-core processor is not always quicker than a Quad-core processor. This is true only when it runs an application that utilizes its capacities or when you’re performing multiple tasks. For instance, one core might be working when you are surfing the web while another is on hold. When a call comes in, the standby core gets the chance to work. Both your browsing and your call proceed effortlessly by the use of multiple cores. Nowadays, many apps take advantage of multiple cores and perform better.  But the actual speed depends on the memory, the graphic processor, and the operating system of your device.
