## Chosen Solution
 My headset does not want to turn on and connect to the wireless adapter. It is charged and has no problems with anything else because I use it with my phone connected to the cable and it sounds good it just will not turn on wirelessly. Please help

 If that is a Bluetooth Headset you have to make sure it isn't connected to anything else. Bluetooth is single stream only and will not work if it is already connected to something else. Like your phone. Disconnect it and make sure the headset is not connected to anything, then connect it to the Bluetooth wireless adapter.

 The answer above is the most common I've run across but in a few cases a step in setup is overlooked. Besides plugging in the adapter for any first time use this set needs to be plugged into the console once as you would a new controller and then it's works perfectly especially when using headset companion app. Depending on preference in the settings you also need to change sound output to all audio from just chat and turn TV volume off completely to avoid echo. Excellent headset for the PS4 and 3
