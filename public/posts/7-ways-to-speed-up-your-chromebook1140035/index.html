These compact and portable machines are renowned for their lightning-fast browsing capabilities. However, with time, even the fastest Chromebook can become sluggish and slow, which can be frustrating for users.\nBut don’t worry! There are several proven tricks you can employ to rev up your Chromebook and restore its super-fast browsing speed. Here are seven of them.\nClear your cache and browsing history Your browser cache and browsing history accumulate over time and can significantly slow down your Chromebook. Clearing them regularly can free up space and help speed up your browsing experience. To do this, click on the three-dot icon on the top-right of your Chromebook’s screen and select “History.” From there, select “Clear browsing data” and choose what you want to delete.\nUse Chrome’s task manager Google Chrome has its own built-in task manager that allows you to monitor and manage what’s running in your browser. When you have multiple tabs open and things start to slow down, use your task manager (Shift + Esc) to identify and close processes that are consuming too much memory or CPU.\nInstall extensions selectively Extensions can enhance your browsing experience by providing extra functionality, but they can also slow down your Chromebook if you have too many of them. Keep only those extensions that you use frequently and disable or remove those that you hardly use.\nDisable unnecessary plugins Plugins are add-ons that run separately from your browser and can contribute to your Chromebook’s lagging. To disable them, type “chrome://plugins” in your address bar, and you can disable any unwanted ones.\nTry out Chrome’s experimental features Chrome has several experimental features that can significantly optimize your browsing speed. Type “chrome://flags” in your address bar and experiment with the available options. However, be mindful of the risks associated with experimental features that may cause compatibility issues or security risks.\nOptimize your Chromebook’s settings Adjusting your Chromebook’s settings can also help. For instance, disabling “hardware acceleration” and “predictive service” may boost speed. You can access these settings under “Advanced” Chromebook settings.\nReset your Chromebook Finally, if all else fails, you may need to reset your Chromebook to factory settings. This will erase everything and restores your Chromebook to its original state. However, it should be considered as a last resort and be backed up so you don’t lose any important data.\nIn conclusion, Chromebooks are great for speedy browsing, but they require some maintenance to continue performing at their best. Adopting these seven tricks should significantly enhance your browsing speed and provide a speedy and seamless browsing experience.\nChromebooks aren’t as fast as laptops. But, they boot up quickly, offer better battery life, and perform tasks efficiently. Nonetheless, there’s a tendency for your Chromebook performance to deteriorate after prolonged use.\nThis usually happens when you overburden your Chromebook beyond its hardware capabilities. In this article, we’ll walk you through 7 ways to speed up your Chromebook. We’ll also highlight factors responsible for slowing down your Chromebook’s performance.\n1. Close Unused Browser Tabs Having too many web pages opened on your web browser (particularly Google Chrome) can take a toll on your Chromebook’s speed and performance. To fix this, close web pages or browser windows you no longer need. For web pages you don’t need at the moment, bookmarking them is a better alternative to leaving them open. To bookmark a webpage on Chrome, click the star icon on the right edge of the browser’s address bar and select Done. That’ll add the page to your browser’s bookmark.\nTo access the bookmarked page, click Chrome’s menu icon, select Bookmark, and select the webpage. That’ll open the page in a new browser tab.\nOne more thing — we strongly recommend reading this guide on making Chrome use less resource-intensive. Your Chromebook will definitely run faster if you can reduce the level of system resources your browser consumes.\n2. Disable or Delete Unused Extensions Although extensions add more functionalities to your browser, they sometimes consume excessive system resources and slow down your browser and device. Go through your browser’s extension menu and remove any unknown or unneeded extensions.\nOn Chrome, tap the menu icon, select More Tools, and choose Extensions.\nMove the toggle to the left to disable an extension, or tap the Remove button to uninstall the extension from Chrome.\nRestart your Chromebook afterward and check if that speeds up your Chromebook.\n3. Close Unused Applications When you launch an app, it’ll consume your Chromebook’s memory, CPU resources, and battery life—even when you aren’t using the app. If you notice that your Chromebook is slow, freezing, or taking forever to execute commands, go through the Shelf and close apps that you aren’t using.\nOn the Shelf, you’ll find a white dot beneath active applications. Right-click an app and select Close.\n4. Update Your Apps Your Chromebook may also begin to slow if apps are outdated. Ensure you update your apps often. Better yet, enable “Automatic App Update” within the Google Play Store.\nUpdate Apps on Chromebook Launch the Google Play Store, tap the profile picture at the top-right corner and select My apps \u0026 games.\nTap the Update button next to any outdated app. If there’s a “No updates available” message on the page, that means all your apps are up-to-date.\nEnable Automatic App Update on Chromebook Configuring the Google Play Store to automatically install app updates will save a lot of time and energy. That may also help speed up your Chromebook because you’ll always have the updated and most efficient versions of your apps.\nLaunch the Google Play Store, tap the profile icon at the top-right corner, and select Settings.\nExpand the General section and select Auto-update apps.\nSelect Over any network and click Done.\nFor Linux apps, you’d have to manually monitor update availability from the developer’s website.\n5. Restart Your Chromebook If your Chromebook continues to perform sluggishly despite closing unused apps and installing app updates, performing a device restart could help speed things up. Before you proceed, remember to close all active apps and files so you don’t lose any unsaved data.\nTap your Chromebook’s Status Area (bottom-right side of the screen) and select the power button. Alternatively, hold your Chromebook’s power button and select Power off.\nWait until Chrome OS shuts down completely and press the power button once to restart your Chromebook.\n6. Uninstall Unneeded Apps Removing applications you don’t need or use can help speed up your Chromebook. Likewise, you’ll also be freeing up a good amount of storage space. This guide on deleting apps on Chromebook has everything you need to know but we’ll briefly walk you through the basics.\nHold the Shift key and tap the launcher icon at the bottom-left corner of the screen.\nRight-click an app you no longer need and select Uninstall.\nTo uninstall a Linux app on your Chromebook, open the Linux apps folder, right-click the app and select Uninstall.\n7. Update Chrome OS A Chrome OS bug may slow down your Chromebook’s performance or cause it to exhibit other known Chrome OS issues. Head to the Chrome OS details page and ensure you have the latest version installed on your device.\nLaunch the Settings menu and select About Chrome OS.\nClick or tap the Check for updates button.\nInstall any Chrome OS update that appears on the screen. You’ll get a “Your Chromebook is up to date” message if you’re running the latest Chrome OS build. If there’s a “Restart to Update” or “Restart” button on the page, there’s a pending update that’s been previously downloaded in the background. Tap the button to restart and update your Chromebook.\nRemember to close your apps before restarting your device, so you don’t lose unsaved files and documents. If you’re unable to update your Chromebook, it has probably reached its Auto-Update Expiration (AUE) date. Go to Settings \u003e About Chrome OS \u003e Additional Details and check the Update schedule row to see your Chromebook’s Auto-Update Expiration date.\nAutomatic Chrome OS updates will no longer be provided by Google beyond this date. Last Resort: Powerwash Your Chromebook If the problem persists, consider performing a power-wash (read: hard reset). That’ll restore your Chromebook to factory default and wipe your files, remove user accounts, and delete all third-party applications. We recommend visiting a nearby authorized service center or contacting the Chromebook’s manufacturer’s support centers. Schedule an appointment and have your Chromebook examined for hardware-related faults.\nShould you decide to factory reset your Chromebook, back up important files to an external storage device or to Google Drive. Refer to this comprehensive guide on power-washing a Chromebook to learn how to hard-reset your device the right way. ","wordCount":"1458","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lillie Hagstrom"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/7-ways-to-speed-up-your-chromebook1140035/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Rev Up Your Chromebook: 7 Proven Tricks to Lightning-Fast Browsing!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 18, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1458 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lillie Hagstrom</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-close-unused-browser-tabs>1.
