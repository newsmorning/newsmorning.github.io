Say Goodbye to Chrome's Frustrating Err Cert Authority Invalid Error with These 5 Simple Tricks!

Have you ever encountered an "Err Cert Authority Invalid" error message while trying to access a website on Google Chrome? This can be frustrating, especially if you need to access the website for work or research. However, don't fret! There are some simple tricks you can use to fix this issue.

But first, let's understand what this error message means. In simple terms, it means that the website's SSL certificate is not trusted by your computer's operating system or web browser. The SSL certificate is responsible for securing your browsing sessions and ensuring the website you are accessing is authentic. This message can occur due to various reasons, including a website's expired SSL certificate, incorrect clock settings on your computer, or malware infection.

Here are the five simple tricks to fix the "Err Cert Authority Invalid" error message and browse the website without any interruptions.

1. Adjust Your Computer Time and Date

Often, the "Err Cert Authority Invalid" error message occurs due to the incorrect time and date settings on your computer. This can happen if the battery of your computer's motherboard dies, or you travel across different time zones. To rectify this issue, go to your computer's date and time settings and ensure that they are accurate. You can also enable automatic time and date update so that your computer stays in sync with your location.

2. Disable Chrome's Safety Check

If you frequently encounter SSL certificate-related errors on Chrome, you can disable the browser's safety check feature. This feature blocks access to websites with untrusted certificates, but it can also be overprotective and prevent access to genuine websites. To disable this feature, type "chrome://flags/#safety-check" in Chrome's address bar and disable the "Enhanced Protection" option. This will stop Chrome from displaying the "Err Cert Authority Invalid" error message.

3. Clear Your Browser Cache and Cookies

Sometimes, an overloaded cache or corrupted cookies can also cause the "Err Cert Authority Invalid" error message to appear. To fix this, clear your browser's cache and cookies from the Settings or History options. This will erase any stale data and ensure that your next browsing session is fresh.

4. Add an Exception for the Website's SSL Certificate

If you are confident that the website you are trying to access is authentic, you can manually add an exception for its SSL certificate. Click on the "Not Secure" icon in Chrome's address bar and select "Certificate." From here, click on "Details" and then "Export" the certificate to your computer. Navigate to Chrome's "Settings" > "Privacy and Security" > "Manage Certificates" > "Import" and select the downloaded certificate. This will add the SSL certificate exception, and you can access the website without any error messages.

5. Scan Your Computer for Malware

Lastly, if none of the above tricks work, it is advisable to scan your computer for malware infections. Malware can affect your computer's settings and interfere with the SSL certificate verification process. Use a reliable antivirus software to scan your computer and remove any detected malware.

In conclusion, the "Err Cert Authority Invalid" error message can be a frustrating experience when browsing the internet. However, with these five simple tricks, you can get rid of this error and enjoy uninterrupted browsing sessions. Remember to practice safe browsing by not accessing suspicious websites or downloading unknown files to prevent malware infections. Stay safe, and happy browsing!

Keeping your Windows 10 security features updated all the time is recommended if you want to complete all your daily tasks safely. Without these, you are likely to encounter errors like NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID on Chrome in Windows 10.
 
## The error message occurs due to connections that are not secure
 
- Switching to another more secure browser is the easiest way to fix the connection not private error message.

That’s why you should always use an antivirus program, have the firewall protection enabled, and your web browsers should be running on the latest build.
 
The most common warning related to network connections that aren’t properly secured is the NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error in Windows 10, a message that comes along with the Your connection is not private error.
 
However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you are about to navigate towards a risky website, as that might be a general error issued by your web browser or by the Windows 10 system.
 
These websites might not have an SSL certificate, the certificate might not be updated, or the server-created credentials or certificates which your web browser cannot rely on.
 
However, sometimes the NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error in Windows 10 or the latest iteration is nothing but a malfunction – you can receive it on all websites or on pages that you know for sure are secured.

Quick Tip:
 
Instead of bothering with complicated fixes, you should rather switch to a safer browser like Opera. It is fast, optimized, has a built-in VPN and Adblock, is feature-rich, and highly customizable.

## What is the meaning of ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID?
 
The error basically indicates a problem with the website’s security certificate. And since the browsers are designed for maximum security, it will prevent you from accessing the website, leading to the ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error.

This could be the case if the website used an expired certificate or it came from an untrusted source. Remember, all the websites throwing the error are not unsafe, but you should, as a precaution, never submit any critical data on these.
 
Also, the problem may lie at the user’s end. It could have to do with the installed antivirus or network settings. So make sure to check those all well.
 
## How do I fix NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID?
 
### 1. Check the Date and Time settings
 
As a security measure, Chrome and all the other web browser clients will let you access webpages only if the Date and Time are set properly. You need to check if your date and time settings are correct.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.

If for some reason, you rolled back the time or the date on your Windows 10 computer, you will receive the NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID error each time you try to access a page through the Internet.
 
This means that your browser’s date and time settings are directly synced with your PC and need to match each other (the different time zones do not affect this).

For BitDefender:
 
- Click on Settings and go to Privacy Control.

- Launch Settings and choose Protection from the left.
 - Now, select Core Shields.
 - Then, pick Web Shield, and untick the checkbox for Enable HTTPS Scanning.

 
For Kaspersky:
 
- Navigate to Settings.
 - Click on Extend and select Network Settings.
 - From there, you should have several options related to the SSL scan.
 - Choose the one that lets you navigate on all browsers.

 
If you are unsatisfied with how your security tool performs, we suggest you switch to one of the best antivirus software for browsing.
