However, navigating the country’s bustling event scene can be overwhelming without the right tools, especially when it comes to purchasing tickets. Thankfully, the rise of innovative ticketing companies is revolutionizing the way Ugandans experience events. Here are the five game-changing ticketing companies you need to know now.\nQuicket Uganda Quicket Uganda is one of the most prominent ticketing companies in the country, and for a good reason. It offers various services, including event registration, ticket sales, and onsite check-ins. One notable feature of Quicket Uganda is its user-friendly interface, which allows event organizers to set up and promote their events quickly. Attendees, on the other hand, can purchase tickets via their mobile devices or laptops. Quicket Uganda has partnered with various payment systems, including mobile money and card payments, making it accessible to everyone.\nTicketSasa TicketSasa is another game-changing ticketing company, known for its robust event promotions and ticketing services. It offers event planners an array of features, including event scheduling, ticket customization, and event analytics. The platform is user-friendly, making it easy for attendees to navigate and purchase tickets. TicketSasa has partnerships with various payment systems, including Visa, PayPal, and mobile money, allowing attendees to purchase tickets effortlessly.\nFezah Fezah is a ticketing company that has revolutionized Uganda’s event scene by focusing on promoting live music events. The platform features different genres of music events while showcasing the diverse talent of Ugandan artists. Fezah offers various features, including event promotion, ticket sales, and on-site check-ins. One of its unique features is its interactive map, which allows attendees to explore different venues and events. Fezah has partnered with different payment providers, making it easy for attendees to purchase tickets.\nKukyala Kukyala is a game-changing ticketing company that focuses on the traditional Ugandan wedding ceremony. It offers various features, including custom wedding invitations, event registration, and ticket sales. The platform allows couples to invite guests digitally, making the traditional process more accessible and efficient. Attendees can easily purchase tickets and access their electronic invitations via their email.\nTiketi Tiketi is an excellent ticketing platform that offers event planners a suite of features, including event scheduling, ticket customization, and event analytics. The platform’s unique feature is its personalized SMS and email campaigns, making it easier for organizers to promote their events. Attendees can purchase tickets via the platform or an SMS shortcode. Tiketi has partnerships with various payment systems, making it possible for attendees to purchase tickets using mobile money or card payments.\nThe evolving event scene in Uganda is a testament to the country’s rich cultural heritage and diverse talent. The emergence of game-changing ticketing companies has made it easier for event planners, organizers, and attendees to navigate the country’s bustling event scene. So, whether you’re planning an event or looking to attend one, these five ticketing companies are a must-know for an unforgettable event experience.\nWhen I attended Kwivuga poetry event early this year at which one of my favorite guitarist Michael Ouma performed together with Michael Kitanda, the new sensational saxophonist you definitely want to check out, it was indication that the way we attend and pay for events hasn’t changed in Uganda. I still had to pay for the event ticket on location using liquid cash.\nHowever, several attempts by different companies have been made to change the ticketing industry in Uganda. A specifically striking and successful one is the case of the “Gagamel cards”, the ATM-like electronic cards that East African reggae artiste Moses Ssali aliased Bebe Cool used for his corporate concert in July this year.\nThere is a lot of fraud and risk taking involved in the ticketing industry in the region. Now several other companies are seizing the opportunity with their own implementations of more effective, fraud-free event ticketing system using a mixture of kiosks, mobile and web/online platforms in Uganda.\nHere are some that showed up on our radar.\n#1. Easy Ticket EasyTicket is an online ticketing solutions provider and also events promoter. The company is pitching their product to event promoters and organizers as a more safe and secure pre- sale ticketing system that they can use to centrally track their sales with upto date technology that help them verify and track venues and premises.\nYou can buy tickets with MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money which are mobile payment platforms or you can use your Mastercard/VISA supported card. Onyait already wrote about the company here in more details.\n#2. Pearl guide App Initially started as an entirely informational tourism App intended to ease the stay and movement of tourists in Uganda, the Pearl guide app has morphed into a more local app that gets you to do stuff. When we criticized the app in our all well-rounded review of the previous version for breaking the loop in what it does or more accurately should do like helping visitors complete bookings, buy tickets, it seems the company rightly listened.\nNow the popular app available on Android, Windows Phone and iOS, through its market network is working with Event Managers to provide gainful advance Ticket Discounts that users can utilize and make savings on their purchases. The App features MTN Mobile Money, Airtel Money, VISA, Ezee Money and MasterCard as payment modes available to users. Pearl guide already has some events up its sleeves that it is going to sell tickets using its platform including Blankets and Wine VII – 14th September 2014, among 3 others.\n#3. Payway Uganda When we spoke to Joshua Musasizi two years ago when Payway had just introduced its sleek ATM-like self-sufficient machines around strategic locations around Kampala, we had no idea the evolutionary trajectory these cool touch-screen based kiosks would turn out to be. In our review, users were only able to load Airtime/data from a number of Telecoms, pay for digital TV service, but now the payment service providers has added several utility services too, supports the Uganda National lottery, Tugende, donations (for Uganda Red Cross Society) and more recently event tickets.\nAccording to the provider’s website, event organizers can now let their customers buy tickets through PayWay self-service kiosks or agents and can check them in using secure 2D QR Code scanning system. High profile events such as Don Moen’s God Will Make A Way Concert and Bebe Cool’s concert mentioned above have used the system.\n#4. Etikiti Etikiti bills itself as a provider of Electronic Ticketing and Access Control solutions to event owners, promoters and venues. The company supports two modes of payment; one through a traditional bank (Centenary bank) with which you make the ticket payment and the other online through their website. With the latter, the company enables event goers make payments using their credit or debit card VISA card.\nBesides having a broken non-updated site with expired events, we find the companies ticketing methods less viable for the Ugandan market and is less likely to favorably compete with the competition.\n#5. Eventbrite Lastly, it’s quite impossible to mention events anyway in the world and not list Evenbrite. Even though not Ugandan, Eventbrite is a global online ticketing service that allows event organizers to plan, set up ticket sales and promote events and publish them across Facebook, Twitter and other social-networking tools directly from the site’s interface. With total funding of up to $140 million that has enabled the company develop a solid platform that serves a worldwide audience with great web and mobile apps, Eventbrite is a real threat to local ticketing companies. I personally have used it to organize some events and it’s absolutely great.\nHowever, local companies listed above are offering localization such as marketing and local payment methods that Eventbrite is not offering to event organizers.\nThat’s it folks, if you know of any key player that slipped our radar, please add in the comments.\nRelated ","wordCount":"1323","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Melinda Loy"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-ticketing-companies-that-are-changing-how-we-attend-and-pay-for-events-in-uganda-972983/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionizing Uganda's Event Scene: 5 Game-Changing Ticketing Companies You Need to Know Now!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 27, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1323 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Melinda Loy</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-easy-ticket>#1.
