I recently purchased an LG TV and was thrilled with the quality of the picture and sound. However, after a few weeks, I noticed that the TV was turning on and off on its own. At first, I thought it was a glitch and tried resetting the TV, but the problem persisted.

I decided to do some research and found out that this was a common problem with LG TVs. I read through multiple forums and watched several YouTube videos looking for a solution. I tried everything from unplugging the TV to updating the firmware, but nothing worked.

I was about to give up and contact LG when I stumbled upon a simple hack that fixed the problem. The solution was to disable the "Quick Start+" feature on the TV. This feature enables the TV to turn on quickly when you press the power button. It is a useful feature, but it can cause the TV to turn on by itself.

To disable the feature, I went to the TV's settings and navigated to "General." There, I found the "Quick Start+" option and turned it off. The TV restarted, and to my surprise, it stopped turning on and off on its own.

I couldn't believe that the solution was that simple. I was grateful that I didn't have to spend money on repairs or a new TV. I also felt relieved because it was frustrating to have a TV that wouldn't stay on or turned off suddenly while watching my favorite shows.

If you're experiencing the same problem with your LG TV, I highly recommend trying this simple hack. It's easy to do, and you don't need any special skills or tools. Hopefully, this solution works for you too.

## Chosen Solution
 Lg google tv keeps turning on and off by itself and then stays on just to pop up the input settings for the hdmi and goes back on when we take it off. and the volumes, power etc. controls on the tv occasionally stop working. Help!

 I had the same problem too, so I took it up on my self and opened my TV. Without knowing what was the issue I suspect it could be the fuse even though I'm not a mechanic  guess what. I replace the fuse and now my TV is just working properly. You don't need a mechanic to replace this you just need screw and a fuse. This fuse is just next to where you hooked in the power supply cable  at the back of the TV but you have to open it with your screw driver.
