Title: The Nightmare of Updating My Home and iPhone 6 Plus: Stuck in Apple Logo Loop

Introduction:

Updating my housing was something I always dreamed of as it was supposed to bring me joy, excitement and a sense of fulfillment. However, it turned out to be a nightmare I never anticipated. Adding to the chaos was the unexpected tragedy of my iPhone 6 plus getting stuck in the Apple logo loop. It was a nightmare I never imagined and this article will walk you through the challenges I faced and the lessons I learned.

Body:

It all started when I decided to update my housing, expand my living room, and change the interior design. The thought was exciting, but things started to go south soon after. The contractor had overpromised and underdelivered, and it turned out to be a nightmare getting things fixed. Every day was a new challenge, and I was getting frustrated. But the worst was yet to come.

As if the housing nightmare wasn't enough, my phone got stuck in the Apple logo loop. I had never heard of such a problem before so I turned to the internet for help. I tried several solutions like a hard reset, updating the phone through iTunes, and even going to the Apple store. Yet nothing seemed to work, and I was beginning to panic. It was as if the universe was conspiring against me.

After a few days of research, I managed to find a solution to the iPhone problem. I had to put the phone in DFU mode and wipe it clean through iTunes. Although it was a tedious process, it worked like magic, and my phone was restored to its former glory. It was a relief, but I could not shake off the feeling that life was testing me in unexpected ways.

It was then that I realized that life can be unpredictable, and there are always unexpected twists and turns along the way. I learned that it was important to be patient, persistent, and resilient even when things don't go as planned. It was also essential to have a support system in place during those challenging times. The experience taught me to appreciate the little things in life and not to take anything for granted, no matter how small.

Conclusion:

Updating my housing and getting my iPhone 6 plus stuck in the Apple logo loop was an ordeal that I wouldn't wish on anyone. It was a surreal experience that challenged my patience and tested my limits. However, amidst the chaos, I found valuable lessons that I will carry with me for a long time. Life can be unpredictable, but it's how we handle the unexpected that shapes us. So don't give up, take a deep breath, and keep moving forward. Who knows, you might just surprise yourself.

## Chosen Solution
 So i will try to keep this short .
I changed the housing on a iphone 6 plus today ( not my first time )
everything worked fine , i disconnected the lcd as i wanted to fix a few things with the home button , when i connected it again the phone just restarts and show the apple logo . i tried another lcd and got the same problem, i connected my phone to itunes and tried to do a recovery its start doing it then after a while it says your iphone could not be find also noticed that my iphone jumps out of the recovery mode during this ( weird ) i tried diffrent usb cables uppdated itunes etc.
any help would be highly appriciated
Regards HUNSEN

 Have you tried Dfu instead of recovery mode? Also have you tried putting the board in your old housing or a different one? Could be an issue with the new housing.
