Title: The Mystery of Dimming Light Bar While Charging Dualshock 4 Chu Zct2U: Solved

If you're a PS4 gamer, you must have noticed the light bar on your Dualshock 4 controller. Its colors and patterns change according to your gameplay, adding to the immersive experience. However, have you ever wondered why the light bar dims while you charge your controller using the official USB cable, model number Chu Zct2U? It's a common query among gamers, and we're here to uncover the truth.

Firstly, let's understand how the Dualshock 4 light bar works. It contains an LED light, which uses the RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) color model to display a wide range of hues. Different games and applications send signals to your controller, which causes the light bar to change colors or patterns. For example, if you're playing a racing game, the light bar will display the color of your car, while shooting games use it to indicate your health level. You can also customize the light bar settings in your console's settings menu.

Now, when you connect your Dualshock 4 to a power source using the official Chu Zct2U cable, the light bar dims. It's an intentional feature designed by Sony to indicate the charging process. When the battery level is low, the light bar's brightness decreases gradually, signifying that the controller is receiving power. If you have customized your light bar brightness to the highest level, then you'll notice a significant dip. However, it's nothing to worry about, and your controller will charge as usual.

According to Sony, the decision to dim the light bar during charging was to conserve battery life. The light bar consumes power, and leaving it on full brightness while charging would result in a slower charging rate and a shorter battery lifespan. Moreover, it was also done to prevent accidental disconnection during charging, as the light bar serves as an indicator that your controller is still connected and receiving power.

If you're still not happy with the dimming light bar, you can turn it off entirely by pressing and holding the PlayStation button on your controller while in-game. It prompts the quick menu, where you can select the Sound/Devices option and then turn off the light bar. However, keep in mind that it may affect your gameplay experience, as some games use the light bar for vital cues.

In conclusion, the mystery of the dimming light bar while charging your Dualshock 4 Chu Zct2U is no longer a mystery. It's a useful feature designed by Sony to conserve battery life, prevent disconnection, and maintain charging efficiency. While it might seem strange at first, it's a minor inconvenience that won't affect your gaming experience. Happy gaming!


## Chosen Solution
 I have replaced the charger board and the ribbon cable while a whole new set of them, but I try to plug my controller in through the front USB port. The light bar gets dimmer and dosnt’t charge. I have another older controller, and it doesn’t have that issue. I also bought 2 new cables, and the original cable non of them worked. I have tried resetting the controller. It didn’t help. I tried forgetting the controller also didn’t help. I have a charger dock that uses the port at the bottom to charge, but I don’t want to put on there in the middle of a game.  Will I have to get a new motherboard or replace the whole controller

 Do you try to change the battery ?
