Impact investing as a belief appealing to investors’ conscience has always been prevalent. But impact investments as a global trend started gaining prominence in 2007. Later, the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) was established in 2009 to bring the impact investors together and share knowledge and investment approaches. The GIIN also focuses on reducing investment barriers and identifying impact investing companies.
 
Now, let’s focus on how impact investments work. First, investors can choose from firms with an attractive social responsibility level. Then, they can decide where to contribute – charity, environment, clean energy, etc., and rule out firms that fall outside their purview. Now, they can consider the financial performance of the companies and decide which one to invest in.
 
### Types of impact investing
 
Some of the variations of impact investments include Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). All these investment methods go beyond traditional investing and commit to society and aim at delivering minimal negative impact to the environment and society, but with minute differences.
 
ESG promotes corporate social responsibility, but the focus is largely on the financial returns. At the same time, SRI involves selecting companies based on certain moral and ethical criteria which appeal to the investors’ conscience.
 
Currently, there are many accepted measures to calculate the returns on investments (both financial and social). The method recommended by the GIIN is the Impact Measurement and Management tool. In addition, the GIIN has introduced an IRIS+ system to help investors measure and optimize their returns.
 
Another metric introduced by the Bridgespan Group and the Rise Fund is the Impact Multiple of Money to calculate the value of impact investments. Social Return on Investment (SROI) is another such measure. Investors can use any metric they find appropriate for their investment.
 
### Examples
 
Let’s look at some examples of impact investments to understand the concept better.
 
#### Example #1
 
John has been investing for almost two decades now. He wishes to contribute to society. Therefore, he decides to start investing in impact investments. As a first step, John becomes a member of the Global Impact Investing Network and studies the concept. Then he invested in the firm XYZ, known for conducting large-scale research on renewable energy sources. John was surprised to see that he got better returns. He was also satisfied with being a responsible citizen and serving the community.
 
#### Example #2
 
Consider this real-life case of how the Russia-Ukraine war disclosed the gap in the impact/of ESG investing. Before the war, several impact investment rating firms rated many Russian companies high. But after the war began, with increasing sanctions, many rating firms suspended the scores for the Russian companies. Also, investing in these companies has become a loss for many investors.
 
Heavy criticisms have been regarding the inability of ESG and impact rating firms to predict counter-productive events. But many rating firms argue that investing solely based on impact scores is not recommended, while others claim that it is impossible to predict such political events.
