Unleash the Force with this Secret List of Insane Glitches in Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga!

Lego games have been a staple in the gaming community for nearly two decades, providing gamers of all ages with a unique gaming experience. The Lego Star Wars series is no exception, transporting players to the galaxy far, far away and allowing them to relive the iconic moments of the Skywalker saga in a fun, lighthearted way. However, sometimes even the most meticulously crafted games can contain a few surprises, and Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is no exception.

In this article, we will uncover some of the most interesting glitches hidden within the game that can provide players with a unique opportunity to experience the game in ways they never thought possible.

First on our list is a glitch that allows players to access normally inaccessible areas. To perform this glitch, players need to be in free play mode and equipped with a character that possesses a double jump ability such as Rey or Luke Skywalker. Players must then jump repeatedly into an object in the environment until they clip through it and land in the area behind it. Once players have accessed these hidden areas, they will find unique items and secrets that are not available in the regular gameplay.

Another glitch that can provide players with a unique experience is one that removes the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen, allowing for a more immersive gameplay experience. To trigger this glitch, players need to be in free play mode and input a specific button combination that varies based on the platform they are playing on. Once the glitch is activated, players can enjoy the game in full-screen mode without any distractions from the black bars.

The third glitch on our list is one that enables players to clone characters, allowing them to create an army of their favorite characters. To activate this glitch, players need to be in free play mode and use a thermal detonator on a character. Once the character has exploded, players must rapidly switch between characters, causing the game to glitch and produce multiple duplicates of the original character.

Finally, we have a glitch that allows players to collect an unlimited amount of studs, the in-game currency used to purchase upgrades and characters. To activate this glitch, players must find a gold brick that is surrounded by silver studs. Once players collect the gold brick, they must pause the game and select "Restart Level." Doing so will cause the game to reset, but the player will still retain the gold brick and all of the silver studs in the environment.

In conclusion, these glitches provide players with unique experiences that differ from the standard gameplay. While glitches can sometimes cause issues in a game, these particular glitches allow players to experience the game in ways they never thought possible. So why not give them a try and unleash the force with this secret list of insane glitches in Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga!

Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the 6th entry of the series & is the successor to Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. But as the fate of all games, there are going to be certain things that don’t work as intended. Those are what we call Glitches. Some of them can be bad while some Good. Whatever the case is, in this guide, I will show you all of the Glitches in Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga.
 
## List of All Glitches in Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga
 

 
Glitches are game-breaking occurrences that may either destroy certain elements of the game or make it such that Players can abuse and cheese through the game. There are plenty of Glitches in Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga, Let’s have a look at them.
 
### Party Member Duplication Glitch
 
This Glitch in the game allows you to Duplicate Characters. This is possible through the Mandalorian Character which is received by purchasing the Deluxe Version of Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga. As of the article, he is the only character that can summon another Character by Default. If you have Mandalorian in your Active Roster and if you change a Character to Mandalorian in your Inactive Roster, it will add him into your Active Roster. You can do this multiple times and you can also switch the characters in the Active Roster, creating an army of your liking. Be careful as this glitch may cause some issues as you leave Cloud City.
 
### Unlimited Laser – Best Glitches in Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga
 
This is one of those Glitches in Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga where you will be able to cheese anything. The Unlimited Laser Glitch will let you shoot a constant Stream from your Laser Blasters. This will only work with Characters that Dual Weild Laser Blasters and have a Sheathing animation like Django. All you have to do is press the Aim & Shoot buttons as the Character is doing the twirling sheathing animation. It’s very inconsistent but once you get it, just hold down the Buttons. It will be interrupted if you do anything like Dodging, stop shooting, or anything in general. This glitch was found by Mortus.
 
### Child Flight Glitch
 
In Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga, there are two ally characters that you cannot kill. Those 2 are Young Anakin Skywalker & Temiri Blagg. The Child Flight Glitch requires the player to use a character with an aerial attack combo and execute those combos on either Anakin Skywalker & or Temiri Blagg. This will result in you and them flying upwards as long as you can keep the jump & attack combo going. This will let you get to otherwise inaccessible places.
 
### Ships Ahoy
 
This is one of those Glitches in the game that allows the player to spawn a Spaceship in the middle of town. It’s a very random glitch but all you have to do is mess around with the Spaceship Menu. You may get lucky and spawn one of them. Also, you will need to be in Episode I. You may or may not need to be in the open world or on a level. Like I have said it is pretty random but the results are hysterical. Keep trying it as you may be able to get it done.
