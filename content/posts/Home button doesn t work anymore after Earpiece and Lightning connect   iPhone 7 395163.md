Title: iPhone 7 Users Beware: Earpiece and Lightning Connect May Be Behind Non-Functioning Home Button!

Are you an iPhone 7 user facing the problem of a non-functioning home button? If so, you are not alone. Many iPhone 7 users have reported this very issue. However, what many of them do not realize is that the culprit behind the non-functioning home button could be the earpiece and the lightning connector.

The home button on the iPhone 7 is not a physical button, but a force-sensitive one, which means that it relies on the vibration or pressure from a user's finger to trigger a response. The earpiece on the iPhone 7 also contains a sensor that detects vibrations or pressure, whereas the lightning connector is responsible for charging the device and transferring data.

So, how can the earpiece and lightning connector be responsible for a non-functioning home button? Well, it's quite simple. If the sensor in the earpiece or lightning connector becomes faulty or damaged, it can interfere with the home button's ability to detect vibrations or pressure.

If you are facing this issue, there are a few things that you can try before heading to the Apple store to get it repaired or replaced. Firstly, try cleaning the earpiece and lightning connector ports with a soft-bristled brush or a toothbrush. Sometimes, dirt or debris can accumulate in these ports, which can interfere with their proper functioning.

Secondly, try resetting your iPhone 7 by holding down the power button and the volume down button together for about 10 seconds. This will force the device to restart and may help get rid of any bugs or glitches that might be causing the home button to malfunction.

If none of these solutions work, then it's time to take your iPhone 7 to the Apple store for repair or replacement. Apple has acknowledged this issue and has offered a temporary solution by providing a virtual home button on the device's screen that can be used instead of the physical one.

In conclusion, if you own an iPhone 7 and are facing the issue of a non-functioning home button, it may be due to a faulty earpiece or lightning connector sensor. You can try cleaning the ports and resetting your device to see if the issue goes away. If not, take it to the Apple store for repair or replacement.

## Chosen Solution
 So I replaced the earpiece and and Lightning connector on an iPhone 7 after muffled hearing and a bad microphone. Once I put it back together and tested it, the microphone still was not working 100% but a lot better than before the repair. After the repair, the home button would not work at all. Is the earpiece and the home button not working together properly? What can I do to regain functionality? How do I address the microphone still not working at 100%?

 Did you disconnect the home button from the screen? Check the home button connection on the motherboard. I would check all of the connections on the motherboard and make sure no pins are damaged. Then clean all of the connections with a qtip and alcohol and a soft brush. Including the charge port connection. You could also have a issue with the audio ic. It's a common problem with the iPhone 7. Any shop that does microsoldering repair can fix that for around 75 dollars. I would give those a try.
