Is Your Acer Aspire Touchpad on the Fritz? Say Goodbye to Frustration with These Quick Fixes for A315-21-92Fx!

For many users, the Acer Aspire A315-21-92Fx is an affordable laptop with decent specs, including an AMD A9 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 15.6-inch display. However, one common issue that can cause frustration is the touchpad not working as it should. But before you give up and buy a new laptop, here are some quick fixes you can try to get your touchpad back on track.

Clean the Touchpad

The first and most basic fix for any touchpad issue is to clean it. Over time, dust and debris can accumulate on the touchpad's surface, causing it to malfunction. So grab a microfiber cloth or a cotton swab and gently wipe the touchpad's surface to remove any dirt or grime. This should be your go-to solution if the touchpad is unresponsive or if it's registering clicks or movements inaccurately.

Disable and Re-Enable the Touchpad

If cleaning doesn't work, the next step is to disable and re-enable the touchpad. This can help reset the touchpad's driver software and clear any glitches that may be causing the issue. To do this, press the Windows key + X and select Device Manager. Expand the Mice and other pointing devices entry, right-click on the touchpad device, and select Disable device. Wait a few seconds, then select Enable device to re-enable the touchpad. This should fix most touchpad issues, including cursor jumping, scroll not working, and touchpad not responding.

Update the Touchpad Driver

Sometimes touchpad issues can be caused by outdated or corrupted drivers. Updating the touchpad driver can often solve these issues. To update the touchpad driver, go to the Acer support website, enter your laptop's model number, and select the Drivers and Manuals tab. Then, download and install the latest touchpad driver compatible with your operating system. Restart your laptop after installing the new driver, and test the touchpad to see if it's working correctly.

Use an External Mouse

If all else fails, and you can't seem to fix the touchpad issue, you can always use an external mouse instead. Just plug the mouse into a USB port on your laptop, and you're good to go. Of course, this won't solve the touchpad issue, but at least you won't have to deal with a non-functional touchpad.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Acer Aspire A315-21-92Fx is a reliable and affordable laptop, but touchpad issues can be frustrating. Fortunately, most touchpad issues can be solved quickly with some basic troubleshooting steps, such as cleaning the touchpad, disabling and re-enabling the touchpad, updating the touchpad driver, or using an external mouse. So don't give up on your Acer Aspire just yet â€“ try these quick fixes, and hopefully, your touchpad will be back on track in no time!


## Chosen Solution
 Hi have updated Bios and Drivers, seems a Windows 10 issue, after reboot touchpad works until device boots into windows 10. The bios contains no touchpad setting to change from basic to advanced. Any ideas or pointers would be great.

 Hi,
Things to try:
I assume that you toggled the Fn+F7 keys and checked if it turns the touchpad on and off?
Try uninstalling the touchpad in Device Manager (right click > Uninstall) and then allowing Windows to "find" it and reinstall it on restart and see if it now works.
Have you got the Synaptics or the Elantech touchpad installed?
Try going to the touchpad manufacturer's website or search for "(insert touchpad make and model number) Win 10 drivers" and finding the drivers appropriate to your model touchpad (see Device Manager for make and model info) and see if they work any better.
