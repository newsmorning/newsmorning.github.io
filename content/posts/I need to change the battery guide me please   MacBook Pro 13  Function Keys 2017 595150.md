Is Your Macbook Pro 13 Dying? Find Out How to Save it With This Easy Battery Change Guide!

The Macbook Pro 13 is known for its sleek design, high-performance, and long battery life. But over time, the battery may start to degrade, causing your laptop to lose its efficiency and performance. If you have noticed that your Macbook Pro 13 is dying, it may be time to replace the battery. This easy battery change guide will help you to save your Macbook Pro 13 from dying.

Step 1: Check Your Battery Status

Before you begin, check the battery status of your Macbook Pro 13. Open the Apple Menu and click on System Preferences. Choose “Energy Saver,” and you will see the current status of your battery.

If you notice that the “Service Battery” warning is indicated, that means it’s time to replace your battery. If your battery was purchased years ago, then it might be time to replace it even if you don't see the warning.

Step 2: Prepare Your Work Area

You need to make sure that you have everything you need before you start. Here is a list of items you will need:

- A replacement battery
- A screwdriver
- A plastic spatula
- A Pentalobe screwdriver
- A soft, clean cloth

Once you have everything ready, find a clean, flat surface to work on. Make sure that you are grounded to prevent static electricity damage.

Step 3: Back up Your Data

Before you begin, it is essential to back up your data to prevent any loss of information. You can back up your data to an external hard drive or to cloud services like Google Drive or iCloud.

Step 4: Replace the Battery

The battery is located inside your Macbook Pro 13. You need to remove the screws that hold the back cover in place. Use a screwdriver to turn the screws counterclockwise until they come out. Place them aside in a safe place.

Use the plastic spatula to carefully remove the battery's connector from its socket. Once it is detached, remove the battery from its compartment.

Insert the new battery into its slot and reattach the connector. Tighten the screws back onto the cover and turn them clockwise until they are secure.

Step 5: Charge the New Battery

Once you have replaced the battery, you should charge it fully before using it. You can do this by plugging in your Macbook Pro and letting it charge for a few hours.

Step 6: Test Your New Battery

After your battery is fully charged, it is time to test it. Unplug your laptop and run it on battery power for a while. If your laptop runs smoothly and the battery life is extended, then you have done the replacement correctly.

Conclusion

Replacing the battery of your Macbook Pro 13 is a simple process that can save you from buying a new laptop. You need to follow these steps carefully, take your time, grounding yourself to prevent static electricity damage, and ensure the safety of your device. With this easy battery change guide, you can now save your Macbook Pro 13 from dying and extend its lifespan.

## Chosen Solution
 I need to change the battery it is very expensive in India,
I also understand that we should change the case is it possible to do it myself? I also understand there is procedure that we can change the battery without the case, since I 'm from India I will request one of my friends who is coming from U.S to purchase a battery for me from your outlet.
I’m also equally annoyed by their backup procedure with i Cloud which is quite expensive, I have my own spare Hard Disk
I need a procedure to dispense off iCloud permanently and a link from my spare hard disc to draw from my backup.
Kindly guide me please.

 First, LOL.
IFixit ships worldwide. You need to swap the case? or not? You are confusing me.
A battery is pretty straight forward in the guides here.
On stopping using icloud I cannot help you here.

 Narayanan - You don’t need to replace the uppercase if the battery only needs to be replaced.
But! If you don’t follow the guide correctly you can damage the keyboard if the solvent gets into the keyboard.
If you think your keyboard is having issues you might want to let Apple fix your system. The Apple Stores only replace the uppercase for either failure. So… If you have bad keys there’s a good chance you’ll get both fixed for Free!

In any case make sure you take out the solvent as it can’t be carried on the plane. Have your friend take it out before flying back and he needs to hand carry the battery onboard in the box.
