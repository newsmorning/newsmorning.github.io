Introduction:

The Macbook Pro 15 Touch Bar 2017 is a popular laptop among individuals who need powerful computing, professional-level editing software, and a reliable device for their daily work. However, even the most advanced technology is not immune to accidents, such as water damage. In fact, the consequences of water damage can be heart-stopping, especially if you rely heavily on your Macbook as your primary tool for work or leisure. In this article, we will explore the shocking consequences of water damage on the Macbook Pro 15 Touch Bar 2017.

Body:

Water damage is a common problem for electronic devices, including laptops. Even a small spill can cause serious damage to the internals of your MacBook Pro. The Macbook Pro 15 Touch Bar 2017 has a sleek and elegant design that creates an immersive user experience. It has a 15.4-inch Retina display, Touch Bar, Touch ID, and more. However, its design leaves little room for water to escape or be drained, increasing the risk of water damage.

The first consequence of water damage on the Macbook Pro 15 Touch Bar 2017 is damage to the motherboard, the central hub that connects all the components. If water seeps into the motherboard, it can damage the circuitry and cause short circuits. The short circuits can destroy components or render them useless, making your MacBook Pro unusable.

The second consequence is damage to the keyboard and trackpad. The Macbook Pro 15 Touch Bar 2017's keyboard and trackpad have intricate electronics underneath, making them vulnerable to water damage. The liquid can seep under the keys and cause them to malfunction or stop working altogether. The trackpad can also become unresponsive, making it difficult to navigate your device.

The third consequence is the loss of data. If your MacBook Pro is damaged by water, you risk losing all your data, including documents, photos, and videos. Even if you have made regular backups, you may still lose some data that was not backed up. This loss could be devastating, especially for professionals who rely on their Macbook Pro for work.

Conclusion:

Water damage can cause heart-stopping consequences for your Macbook Pro 15 Touch Bar 2017. It can damage the motherboard, keyboard, and trackpad, rendering your device unusable. Furthermore, it can result in data loss, which can be disastrous for professionals who need their data to perform their work.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
Recently, I spilled water on my mac book, A1707.
All functions are good except screen and touch bar.
1) Screen : black, but external screen is normal operation.
2) Touch Bar : working but not response to touch
and after apple testing, it says VFD001 error.
What shall I do?
Can I resolve the issues by replacing LVDS cable and touch bar assembly (or cable)?
Thank you for your advice in advance.

 I would stop using the system and disconnect the battery so as not to damage things any further! Water or any liquid can fester causing more damage and with the addition of power will speed it up.
At this point you’ll need to take the logic board out to inspect the damage, the Touch Bar connects to it. Look for corrosion damage. Depending on where the spill hit you might need to also check the T-CON board for damage as well. which can explain the lack of display.
Replacing the cable likely won’t fix anything. I’m suspecting you have corrosion damage on the logic board and the T-CON. This gets into if you can clean the corrosion off to get things going again or the need to get to someone who has the deeper skills to fix your system or if replacing is the only direction. This could be quite expensive!
Update (01/28/2020)
To get to the T-CON so you can clean it, you’ll need to remove the display following this guide MacBook Pro 15" Touch Bar Late 2016 Screen Replacement
The logic board will likewise will need to be removed as well. Sadly, we don’t have a guide for that but its mostly obvious when you review the teardown here MacBook Pro 15" Touch Bar Teardown and after you’ve removed the display assembly following the display guide.

You’ll need a soft tooth bush and 85% reagent isopropyl alcohol being careful not to pull off any of the small components. You will need to pull off the metal shields carefully as they need to be put back. This is not an easy job and you still likely have damaged components! You can’t just replace the displays backlight fuse as there’s more to it than that.
After cleaning the liquid spill for the two boards You’ll then need to look at boardview drawings and schematics to figure out what got damaged in the areas you located the damage. Then the hard part locating the needed replacement parts.
As you can see this is quite a big job! I personally would ship my system to someone who does this for a living! They have the needed skills, tools and access to parts. The other approach is just replace the assemblies which gets into quite an expense in your case!
Do you have data on your drive you need to gain access to? You might try booting the system up in Target Disk Mode after you’ve cleaned things up.

 Definitely stop using the machine. With any form of liquid damage to any electronic, it is best to shut it down, and disconnect its source of power. If you’re really brave, you can open it up and inspect it yourself for corrosion or you can seek out a professional’s help.
