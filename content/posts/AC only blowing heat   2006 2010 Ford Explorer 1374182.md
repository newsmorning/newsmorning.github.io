Introduction

During the hot summer days, your Ford Explorer's air conditioning system is your go-to for relief from the scorching heat. But, have you ever experienced your AC only blowing out hot air when you're expecting a cool breeze? If yes, then you're not alone. Several Ford Explorer owners experience the same issue, and many of them wonder if it's a mechanical issue that requires expensive repairs. However, there's a simple reason why your Ford Explorer's air conditioning only blows heat. Let's dive into it.

Reason for AC Only Blowing Heat

If your Ford Explorer only blows hot air when you turn on the AC, it's likely because of a blend door actuator failure. The blend door actuator is responsible for controlling the air's temperature flow in the cabin, whether it's the hot air or cold air. When it's not working correctly, it can cause the AC to blow hot air instead of the desired cool air.

The blend door actuator is a small motor that controls a flap or "blend door" that regulates the temperature of the air blowing into your Ford Explorer's cabin. Over time, the blend door actuator's electrical connections, motor, or plastic arms can wear out or break, causing the AC to stop working correctly.

How to Fix the Issue?

The blend door actuator is relatively easy to replace, and it's a job that can be done at home with some basic tools. You'll need to locate the faulty actuator and then remove it from your Ford Explorer to install the new one. This may require some disassembly of your dashboard, so it's essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. You can also take your Ford Explorer to a mechanic and have it fixed by a professional.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're experiencing your Ford Explorer's AC only blowing heat, the culprit is most likely a failing blend door actuator. It's not a significant mechanical failure that requires expensive repairs. Instead, it's a small part that can be easily replaced. If you're comfortable working on your car, you can tackle this issue on your own. Alternatively, you can take your Ford Explorer to a mechanic and have the issue taken care of in no time. Don't sweat it out during the hot summer months; get the AC fixed and enjoy a cool ride.

## Chosen Solution
 My blend door actuator started clicking and was stuck on AC. I finally just replaced the actuator and now I have heat but I now only have heat.  No matter what I set the temp setting to it just blows hot air out of all the vents on both sides, driver and passenger.

 I would guess that there is still a problem with the blend door.
If it were “clicking” I would think the actuator was attempting to move the door, but something was wrong with the drive.
Or it could be that the actuator did not get installed properly.
