# You Won't Believe the Bizarre Issue Plaguing These In-Ear Headphones - Have You Experienced It Too?

Have you ever experienced a strange issue with your in-ear headphones? You know, the kind that leaves you scratching your head and wondering what on earth is going on? Well, you're not alone. A growing number of people are reporting a bizarre problem with their in-ear headphones, and it's causing all sorts of frustration and annoyance.

The issue in question is a strange popping or clicking sound that occurs when the headphones are being worn. It's not a subtle or occasional noise, either - it's a loud and persistent sound that can completely ruin the listening experience.

So, what's causing this strange popping sound? There are a few theories floating around, but none of them seem to have a definitive answer. Some believe that it's caused by the ear wax build-up inside the headphone's earbuds, while others think it's an issue with the wiring or jacks. Whatever the cause, it's clear that this problem is widespread and affecting a large number of people.

The frustration of this issue is compounded by the fact that it can be difficult to diagnose and fix. Some people have reported trying everything from cleaning the earbuds with alcohol to resetting their devices, but the problem persists. This can lead to a lot of wasted time and money trying to troubleshoot the problem, with no real solution in sight.

So, what can be done about this frustrating issue? The first step is to determine whether the problem is with the headphones themselves or with the device they're being used with. If the issue is only happening with one pair of headphones, then it's likely a problem with the headphones themselves. In this case, it may be necessary to replace them with a different pair.

If the problem is happening with multiple pairs of headphones, then it's likely an issue with the device they're being used with. In this case, it may be necessary to update the device's software or try using a different audio player app.

In any case, it's clear that this issue is causing a lot of frustration for those affected by it. Until a definitive solution is found, it's up to us to keep searching for answers and sharing our experiences to help one another find a way forward. With persistence and a little bit of luck, we can hopefully put an end to this bizarre in-ear headphone issue once and for all.

## Chosen Solution
 So, I’m using these earphones for 8 months. It worked fine for the first 3 months or so and then the left earphone stopped working no matter what device I plug it into. I thought it was some problem with the wiring inside the earphone and thought to replace them. So one day I plugged it to my phone and suddenly both of them started working. I thought ok, seems fine. Then the right one stopped working after a few days. This whole thing has repeated two times to me. I’m really confused. Suggestions?(Stopped working - very faint sound compared to the other one.

 Hi,
It’s most probably a fractured cable.
Plug the cable into a music source (mobile phone) and listen to the audio.
If there is audio, or even if there isn’t, hold the plug where it enters the socket, and then gently, stress gently move the cable back and forth, where it exits the plug and listen if it affects the audio at all.
If it doesn’t then try the same where the cable enters the earphones. If it does affect the audio when moving it there and if they are the in ear type it will be difficult (if not impossible) to repair as most likely the cable is molded to the earphones
If it does then the wires in the cable are fractured where it exits the plug. This is usually caused by removing the plug from the socket by pulling on the cable and not removing it by grabbing it by the plug.
This can be repaired by cutting the cable back a few inches and re-terminating the wires on a new plug.
Before cutting the cable, remove the insulation (as best as you can) from the plug to expose the wiring connection. Note what colour wire goes where. Write it down! This will make it easier when it comes to connecting a new plug to the cable.
Depending on whether the plug is a 3 or 4 pole plug depends on what plug you have to look for.
If it is a 3 pole plug, search for a 3.5mm TRS cable mount plug
If it is a 4 pole plug, search for a 3.5mm TRRS cable mount plug.
There are videos on YouTube that show how to terminate the plugs.
