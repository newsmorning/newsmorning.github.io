When it comes to managing printers in your workplace or network, Group Policy is a great way to ensure that your printing configuration stays consistent and up-to-date. But sometimes, things can go wrong, and you might encounter some printer woes that leave you scratching your head. 

In this article, we'll take a look at five easy hacks that you can use to fix your Group Policy printer issues and get your printing back on track.

## Hack #1: Check the Printer's Driver

One of the most common issues with Group Policy printers is driver problems. If you're unable to connect to a printer or have trouble printing to it, the driver might be the culprit. 

First, check that the printer's driver is installed on the computer you're trying to print from. If it's not there or is out of date, download and install the latest version from the printer manufacturer's website.

Alternatively, you can also try updating the driver through the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC). Simply navigate to the Printers folder and select "Update Driver" to see if that fixes the issue.

## Hack #2: Check Group Policy Settings

Another potential issue is misconfigured Group Policy settings. Double-check that the printer policy settings are correct and that the printers are being deployed to the appropriate Organizational Units (OUs).

You can also use the Group Policy Results wizard to check if the policy is being applied to the computer or user. If it's not, you might need to adjust your Group Policy settings to ensure that the printer policy is being properly enforced.

## Hack #3: Clear the Printer Spooler

If you're experiencing issues with print jobs getting stuck in the queue or not printing at all, clearing the printer spooler might help. 

To do this, open the Services console and locate the Print Spooler service. Right-click and select "Stop." Then, navigate to the %systemroot%\System32\Spool\Printers folder and delete all the files inside. Finally, restart the Print Spooler service and try printing again.

## Hack #4: Restart the Print Server

Sometimes, the issue might be with the print server itself. Restarting the print server can help to clear any glitches and get your printers back to normal.

To do this, open the Services console and locate the Print Spooler service. Right-click and select "Stop." Then, navigate to the Print Server Properties and select the "Advanced" tab. Click "Restart Print Spooler" and wait for the service to restart before trying to print again.

## Hack #5: Delete and Re-Add the Printer

If all else fails, removing and re-adding the printer to the computer might solve the issue. 

First, remove the printer from the computer's Devices and Printers by right-clicking and selecting "Remove Device." Then, navigate to the Group Policy Management Console and delete the printer policy for the printer.

Finally, re-add the printer to the computer by navigating to Devices and Printers and selecting "Add Printer." Choose the network printer you want to add, and if it's configured correctly, the printer should reinstall and start working like normal.

Wrapping Up

These five easy hacks aren't the only solutions to Group Policy printer woes, but they are a great place to start. Whether it's checking the printer driver, clearing the spooler, or restarting the print server, these hacks should help you get back to smooth and uninterrupted printing.

Remember, always double-check your Group Policy settings and test your printers to ensure that they're working correctly. With these simple hacks, you'll be managing your printers like a pro in no time.

Group Policy is a powerful tool for managing Windows computers. But there are times when it just doesn’t work as you expect. Perhaps you have an existing policy that has been working fine, but now it doesn’t seem to be applying some settings or adding new printers. 
 
## Our tested solutions are waiting for you

If you’re trying to import printers using GPOs on your domain controllers and they’re not working, then there might be something blocking outbound connections such as your firewall. 
 
Most of the time, you’ll find that you don’t have permission to perform this operation. In such a case, you may need to set the account to an administrator account to enable you to make any changes.
 
## Why can’t I add a shared printer? 
 
If you are wondering why you are unable to add a shared printer, below are some common causes:
 
- The printer is offline – The printer you are trying to add may not be on the network. If the printer is offline, it will not appear as a shared printer in the list.
 - You are not on the same network – To use Group Policy to add shared printers, you must be able to connect to the print server. If your client computer is not connected to a domain, or if the printer is not on the same subnet as the client computer, you will not be able to add shared printers through Group Policy.
 - The policy admin is not an administrator – It is possible that the policy admin is not an administrator on the computer. If this is the case, they will not be able to install printers or add printer drivers. To fix this, you need to make sure that the policy admin has admin privileges on the computer.

 
Now that you are aware of why you are unsuccessful in adding a printer, below are some easy troubleshooting solutions.
 
## How can I fix a Group Policy that is not adding printers
 
### 1. Ensure you have permissions 
 
The first thing to do is to ensure that you have permissions on the GPO. If the Group Policy printer access is denied, it’s probably because you are using a standard account. You can change this can be done by running GPMC as an Administrator. If you start the Group Policy Editor with elevated permissions, then it will automatically use those permissions when you open it up.
 
When adding a network printer to your computer and it isn’t working, ensure that you have the correct permissions. If your account is a part of the Administrators group, you should be able to add printers from any computer on your network.
 
### 2. Restart Group Policy Service
 
- Press the Windows + R keys simultaneously to open the Run command.
 - Type in services.msc, then press Enter.
 - Navigate to the Group Policy Client and right-click on Services.
 - Select Properties and change the Startup type to Automatic.
 - Click on Start, then Apply.
 - Hit OK to save the changes.

 
### 3. Remove the default printers 
 
If you have added a printer before and it was not added correctly, then there are chances that the policy is still referring to that printer. 
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

The solution is to remove that printer from all of your client computers and then try adding it again. This will make sure that only the correct printers are being added by Group Policy. If Windows failed to apply the deployed printer connections settings, you can refresh your connection.
 
Another thing you should do is test if any of your printers have gone offline. To test if this is the case, try printing something from one of your computers using one of these offline printers. If it prints successfully then there must be another issue.
 
### 4. Refresh policy settings
 
- Hit the Windows key, type cmd and select Run as administrator.
 - Type in the following command and press Enter: GPupdate/force

 
The Group Policy refresh process happens automatically every 90 minutes. However, you can update it manually. This will refresh all the policies on that computer, including any printer policies.

### 5. Reset Group Policy Editor
 
- Hit the Windows key, type cmd and select Run as administrator.
 - Type in the following commands and press Enter after each one: RD /S /Q "%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicyUsers" && RD /S /Q "%WinDir%\System32\GroupPolicy" gpupdate /force
 - Restart your PC.

 
This can be useful if you’ve changed a setting and then realize that it wasn’t what you wanted. You can use this option to undo an incorrect setting before applying it to other computers.
 
If none of these solutions works for you, try restarting your PC in Safe Mode or reinstalling Windows.
