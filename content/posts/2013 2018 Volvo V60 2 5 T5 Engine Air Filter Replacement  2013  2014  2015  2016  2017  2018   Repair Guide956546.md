# You're Breathing in Toxic Air every time you Drive your 2013-2018 Volvo V60! Find out how to Replace your Engine Air Filter like a Pro with this Ultimate Repair Guide!

As a proud owner of a 2013-2018 Volvo V60, you rely on your car to provide you with high-quality performance and a comfortable ride. However, did you know that the air you breathe while driving your car can be hazardous to your health? The engine air filter in your Volvo V60 keeps harmful pollutants and particulates from entering your engine and blowing out of your tailpipe. But, if the filter is dirty, it can't do its job properly, which can lead to poor engine performance, reduced gas mileage, and even serious health problems. Fortunately, replacing your engine air filter is a straightforward process that you can do yourself, even if you're not mechanically inclined. In this ultimate repair guide, we'll walk you through the steps of replacing your engine air filter like a pro.

## What Is an Engine Air Filter?

An engine air filter is a critical component of your car's engine system that works to protect the engine from harmful pollutants, particulates, and debris. It works by trapping airborne contaminants, including dirt, dust, pollen, and other debris, before they can enter the engine, ensuring that only clean, filtered air reaches the engine's combustion chamber. Without an engine air filter, your car's engine would suck in dirty air, causing damage and possibly even engine failure. It's essential to replace your engine air filter as recommended by your car's manufacturer to keep your engine running smoothly and prevent costly repairs.

## Signs that Your Engine Air Filter Needs to be Replaced

Your engine air filter is a critical component of your car's engine system, and if it becomes too dirty or clogged, it can lead to poor engine performance, reduced gas mileage, and even serious health problems. If you notice any of the following signs, it's time to replace your engine air filter:

- Reduced engine performance or rough idling
- Decreased gas mileage
- Unusual engine sounds
- A dirty or clogged filter element

## How to Replace Your Engine Air Filter Like a Pro

1. Park your Car in a Safe Location: Start by ensuring that your Volvo V60 is in a safe location with the engine turned off and the parking brake engaged. Open the hood of your car and locate the engine air filter box.

2. Remove the Old Filter: The filter box is typically located at the front of the engine compartment and is secured by clamps or screws. Remove the clamps or screws and lift the cover off the filter box. Remove the old filter by sliding it out of the filter box.

3. Clean the Filter Box: Take the opportunity to clean the inside of the filter box with a clean rag or vacuum. Make sure there is not any debris or dirt in the filter box.

4. Install the New Filter: Slide the new filter into the filter box with the rubber molding facing the engine. Make sure that the filter element seals completely against the housing. Close the cover of the filter box and secure it with the clamps or screws.

5. Check the Air Intake Channel: Check the air intake channel for debris, like leaves or twigs. Clean the air intake channel with a clean rag or vacuum if you find any debris.

6. Test the New Filter: Start your car and let it run for a few minutes. You should be able to tell a noticeable change in the quality of air coming from your air conditioning vents. 

## Final Thoughts

Your engine air filter may be out of sight, but it is an essential component of your car's engine system. Replacing your engine air filter as recommended by Volvo will help keep your engine running smoothly, improve fuel efficiency, and protect your health by preventing harmful pollutants from entering your car's cabin.
