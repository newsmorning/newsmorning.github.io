# Unlock Hidden MacBook Pro Powers: Change Single Key to Supercharge Your Retina Display Experience

Are you one of those MacBook Pro users who always look for ways to optimize their device's performance and enhance their overall user experience? If your answer is yes, then you may already be familiar with the term "keyboard shortcuts." A keyboard shortcut is a quick way to perform a specific action in your MacBook Pro that would normally require multiple steps.

But did you know that you can change a single key on your MacBook Pro to unlock hidden powers that can supercharge your Retina display experience? Yes, it's possible, and we'll show you how.

## Step 1: Identify the key you want to change

The first step is to identify the key that you want to change. It could be any key that you think is not as useful as others or rarely used in your daily tasks. For this article, we'll use the "F1" key as an example.

## Step 2: Install Karabiner-Elements

Karabiner-Elements is a free and open-source software that allows you to customize the keys on your keyboard. It's easy to use and highly customizable. Here's how to install it:

1. Go to https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org
2. Click on "Download"
3. Install the app on your MacBook Pro

## Step 3: Create a new "Complex Modification" rule

Once Karabiner-Elements is installed, launch the app and click on the "Complex Modifications" tab. Click on the "Add rule" button and select "Add rule to selected profile."

In the "rule definition" section, click on "Add item" and select "Seil Virtual Keyboard keycode." In the "from keycode" field, type "59" (which is the keycode for the "F1" key). In the "to keycode" field, type "131" (which is the keycode for the "Brightness Up" key).

Click on the "Add item" button again and select "Seil Virtual Keyboard keycode." In the "from keycode" field, type "112" (which is the keycode for the "Volume Down" key). In the "to keycode" field, type "59" (which is the keycode for the "F1" key).

## Step 4: Enable the new rule

Once you've created the new rule, click on the "Enable" button to activate it. You'll now be able to use the "F1" key to increase the brightness of your MacBook Pro's Retina display. Pressing the key twice in quick succession will enable the "Supercharge" mode, which will boost the display brightness even further.

Pressing the key again will return the brightness to its previous level. Additionally, holding down the "Fn" key while pressing the "F1" key will decrease the volume.

## Step 5: Customize to your liking

Karabiner-Elements offers numerous customization options that allow you to tailor your MacBook Pro's keyboard to your needs. You can create your own rules or modify existing ones. Feel free to experiment and find the best setup that works for you.

In conclusion, changing a single key on your MacBook Pro can unlock hidden powers that can supercharge your Retina display experience. With Karabiner-Elements, you can customize your keyboard and create your own shortcuts that will increase your productivity and enhance your overall user experience. Give it a try and see the difference it can make!

 Hello,
I have a MacBook Pro 13" Retina Display Late 2013 and I would like to know what is the key type of this keyboard, because I am thinking of changing some keys from its keyboard (It has a US layout and I would like to change some keys to Portuguese Layout). I've read on the internet that there are small differences in the hinge mechanism, as there are many types of key/hinge (like this website explains: http://www.thebookyard.com/apple_keycaps...)
I would like to know what is the key type in this specific model (in order for me to buy individual keys) and if I should be able to replace them myself.
Thanks in advance,

 The 2013 retina model comes in 2 versions, I found out when i had to replace mine, I did not purchase from that link you gave but we did purchase them from replacementlaptopkeys.com, the direct link for the keys is apple retina laptop key
We ended pulling off one key and compare and the keys they sent to us was a perfect fit, and install could not be easier, it took seconds.

 Hello,
you can buy single keys on this site: http://www.laptopkey-europe.eu/

 Thanks for your help! Those keys you mentioned are for replacing US keys. Does anybody know where can I find similar keys but for replacing Portuguese keys (that have the "รง", "~", etc).
