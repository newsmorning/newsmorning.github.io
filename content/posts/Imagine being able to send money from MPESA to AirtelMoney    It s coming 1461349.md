Revolutionary Money Transfer Coming Soon: Send Mpesa to Airtel Money with Ease!

Nairobi, Kenya - Money transfer has always been a crucial aspect of citizens' life in Kenya, as it serves as a driving force for financial inclusion and economic empowerment. Up until recently, Mpesa has been the primary mobile money transfer service provider in Kenya, with Airtel Money playing catch-up. However, things are about to change as a revolutionary new money transfer service is set to launch offering the ability to transfer funds from Mpesa to Airtel Money with ease.

This new transfer service comes as a result of a partnership between Safaricom and Airtel, two of the largest mobile service providers in Kenya. The partnership aims to promote financial inclusion by allowing users to send money seamlessly from one mobile service provider to another, with minimal hassle.

The new transfer service will not only be convenient, but also affordable for users. Money transfer charges will be low and competitive, with reduced tariffs and minimal transaction fees. This makes the service easily accessible to low-income earners, thus promoting financial inclusion.

The launch of this service is expected to have a far-reaching impact on the economy of Kenya. Many Kenyans rely on mobile money transfers to do business, pay for goods and services, or even to support their families across the country. The new service will make it easier for users to access funds, and for businesses to complete transactions effortlessly.

In addition, the introduction of this transfer service promises to stimulate competition, resulting in the improvement of the mobile money industry as a whole. It also encourages collaboration between mobile service providers, which is ultimately beneficial to consumers.

The launch of the transfer service is timely, given the current global pandemic. Many Kenyans have increasingly moved towards digital payments as a way of avoiding physical cash in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The introduction of a reliable and affordable digital money transfer service will be vital in facilitating financial transactions in the region without risking the spread of the virus.

In conclusion, the new mobile money transfer service that allows users to send money from Mpesa to Airtel Money is a game-changer for the mobile money industry in Kenya. It will enhance financial inclusion, increase competition, and stimulate economic growth, making it an exciting development that will revolutionize the way Kenyans transfer money.

Mobile money users in Kenya will soon be able to send and receive money irrespective of which network they are on. Operators have begun testing systems that will soon make the interoperability possible. This means you can send money directly from your M-PESA to AirtelMoney mobile wallet directly. This move is set to reignite hopes that the competitive telecom industry is ready for self-regulation.
 
In the pilot phase, Safaricom and Airtel will each provide 100 employees beginning today to carry out tests to make sure the systems are ready for mass roll out. While speaking at the launch event in Nairobi, Kenya’s ICT cabinet secretary Joe Mucheru said that the initiative will inject efficiency, increase competition and hopefully bring down the cost of transactions.
 

 
The main players in the county, Safaricom’s M-PESA and Airtel’s AirtelMoney will be the first to be tested and to go live. Telkom’s Mobile Money platform that is yet to be launched will then come on board in the second phase in February according to CS Mucheru.
 
This development could potentially break Safaricom’s monopoly as Safaricom’s products are often way pricey compared to the competition. Subscribers have been forced to stick around and persevere as M-PESA hasn’t had a viable alternative really. AirtelMoney scrapped off transfer fees across networks back in 2012 while Safaricom still charges up to 4 times to transfer off-network as they do to transfer within their network.
 
At the moment, AirtelMoney subscribers have to visit an M-PESA agent to withdraw money sent to them by M-PESA subscribers, then look for an AirtelMoney agent to deposit the same funds before they can use mobile money services. With this new move, AirtelMoney subscribers will receive funds directly into their Mobile wallets irrespective of whether the sender is an M-PESA or AirtelMoney subscriber. Beyond that, interoperability in Kenya will allow consumers the ability to access different services in case one network experience technical hitches or is undergoing weekend long system upgrades…ahem!!
 
If successfully launched, Kenya will become the second country in the continent to introduce mobile money Interoperability after Tanzania which launched wallet-to-wallet interoperability in September 2016
