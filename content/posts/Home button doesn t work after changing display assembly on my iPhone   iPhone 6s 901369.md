Title: iPhone 6S Disaster: How Changing Your Display Assembly Can Kill Your Home Button – Warning!

Introduction:

Apple’s iPhone 6S is one of the most iconic smartphones in the world. However, it’s not exempt from issues that can arise from time to time. In this article, we’ll be discussing a potential disaster that could happen if you decide to change your display assembly. It’s no secret that DIY repair is a growing trend with mobile devices, but we want to share a word of caution with iPhone 6S users: changing your display assembly could end up killing your home button.

Body:

The issue has to do with the unique Touch ID sensor that is located on the iPhone 6S’s home button. As of now, there is no way to replace an iPhone home button and maintain the Touch ID fingerprint sensor functionality. Your home button is paired with the phone’s logic board and therefore can’t be replaced.

So, what happens when you change your iPhone 6S display assembly while trying to fix your broken screen? You end up disconnecting your home button from the logic board which in turn, eliminates the Touch ID functionality. This can be problematic as the Touch ID feature is integral to your phone's security by using your fingerprint to unlock your phone, authorize payments, and access sensitive data. Without it, you'll be required to enter a passcode each time you want to unlock your phone or use it with apps that require Touch ID.

Additionally, if you change your display assembly and disconnect your home button, even if you hook it back up, there’s a good chance that it won’t work the same as it did before. Issues could include slower performance, not responding at all, or partially working. The consequence of this is having to replace your complete device with a new one, which can be expensive.

There are also many third-party repair services that may offer home button replacement, but you should be wary of those as they might use cheaper, inferior quality parts that could end up causing more problems than the ones they fix. It’s important to realize that if your home button goes bad, it’s best to contact Apple Support or a reputable repair service.

Conclusion:

Ultimately, changing your iPhone 6S display assembly can be disastrous if you’re not careful. By disconnecting your home button from the logic board, you’ll end up losing Touch ID functionality, and although it may seem like an easy fix, it’s not. Instead, always take your iPhone to a trusted repair shop or contact Apple Support in case of any issues.

We hope this article has been informative and will help you avoid making costly mistakes when dealing with your iPhone. By following these cautionary recommendations, you can keep your iPhone running seamlessly without any malfunctions.

 After changing the display assembly on my iPhone 6S, my HOME button doesn't work anymore.  The phone gave me an alternate way to access my home screen.  I replaced the HOME screen button assembly, but it still won't recognize that the HOME button replacement.  Any suggestions out there?

 I'd say you received a faulty screen/flex connector cable that is integrated into the backlight.  I got one that did the same to me.
Have you tried the original screen again with the home button? See if that works. If not, there is a possibility that the home button flex was damaged in the process.
Good luck and keep us posted!
