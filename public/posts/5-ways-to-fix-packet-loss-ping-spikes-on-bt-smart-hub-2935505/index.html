It’s even worse when you’re trying to get some work done, download a large file, or stream your favorite movie on Netflix.\nIf you’re using the BT Smart Hub 2 router, you’re in luck because you can easily troubleshoot your network issues with some simple yet effective hacks that can improve your internet speeds and overall browsing experience. Here are five of them:\nPosition your router strategically The placement of your router can either make or break your internet speeds. If you place it in a closet, behind a couch, or inside a cabinet, the signals are likely to get blocked or weakened, resulting in slower and weaker connections.\nTo fix this, try to position your BT Smart Hub 2 in a central location where the signals can reach all corners of your house. Also, keep it away from other wireless devices such as cordless phones, microwaves, or baby monitors to avoid interference.\nChoose the right channel The BT Smart Hub 2 router comes with several channels that broadcast the Wi-Fi signals. By default, it’s set to auto, which means it selects the channel with the least interference.\nHowever, it’s not always optimal, especially if you live in a crowded area with many Wi-Fi routers around. To find the best channel, download a Wi-Fi analyzer app or use the tools built into your router’s settings to see which channels are least congested and choose them manually.\nOptimize your router’s settings The BT Smart Hub 2 router comes with several settings that you can tweak to improve your internet speeds, reduce buffering, and avoid disconnections. Some of these settings include:\n• Band steering – This feature automatically switches between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies to avoid interference and use the best connection available.\n• Smart setup – This feature guides you through the setup process and optimizes your router’s settings for better performance.\n• QoS (Quality of Service) – This feature prioritizes certain types of traffic such as online gaming, video streaming, or voice calls for better performance.\nUse a Wi-Fi extender If you have a large house or office, you may still experience weak Wi-Fi signals in certain areas despite following the previous tips. In this case, you can use a Wi-Fi extender that amplifies your router’s signals to reach further areas.\nThe BT Smart Hub 2 is compatible with the BT Mini Whole Home Wi-Fi, a Wi-Fi mesh system that consists of multiple nodes that work together to create a seamless network with no dead spots.\nUpdate your router’s firmware Like all other technology products, your BT Smart Hub 2 router needs occasional updates to fix bugs, enhance security, and improve performance. To update your router’s firmware, follow these steps:\n• Log in to your router’s web interface using your admin credentials.\n• Go to the Settings or Advanced Settings section and click on Firmware Update.\n• If there’s a new update available, click on Download and Install.\n• Wait for the update process to complete, which may take a few minutes. Remember not to interrupt the process or turn off your router.\nIn conclusion, these five simple hacks can greatly improve your internet speeds, reduce buffering, and ensure a smooth browsing experience with your BT Smart Hub 2 router. Try them out and see how much of a difference they can make!\nData is sent and received across a network in small units known as packets in any network environment. This is true for everything you do on the internet, including emailing, uploading or downloading images or files, browsing, streaming, gaming, and even voice and video communication.\nGive a try to these tested solutions and BT Smart Hub 2 work again Data is sent and received across a network in small units known as packets in any network environment. BT Smart Hub 2 packet loss occurs when one or more of these packets are interrupted during their journey. Fortunately, you can easily fix packet loss and ping spikes on BT Smart Hub 2 by restarting your router and more. Other tips are found below. BT Smart Hub 2 packet loss occurs when one or more of these packets are interrupted during their journey.\nPing is your connection’s reaction time, or how quickly you receive a response after sending out a request. A low ping indicates a more responsive connection, which is particularly important in real-time applications such as gaming and voice and video calls. Milliseconds are used to measure ping (ms).\nWhy am I all of a sudden getting packet loss on BT Smart Hub 2? There are a couple of reasons why you are getting BT Smart Hub 2 packet loss. One of them is network congestion. Congestion on the network is the most common cause of network packet loss. Since all networks have space constraints, network congestion is very similar to peak hour traffic.\nBrowse the web from multiple devices with increased security protocols.\nAccess content across the globe at the highest speed rate.\nConnect to thousands of servers for persistent seamless browsing.\nAnother major issue for your network is the rate at which hardware becomes obsolete or redundant these days. Firewalls, routers, and network switches consume a lot of power and can significantly weaken network signals.\nSoftware bugs are another reason you are getting BT Smart Hub 2 packet loss. Bugs or glitches in your system can sometimes cause network performance to degrade and packet delivery to fail.\nHardware reboots and patches may be necessary to resolve bugs. Other reasons include security threats and overtaxed devices. How do I fix packet loss on BT Smart Hub 2? 1. Do a ping test Click the Windows Start button, type Command Prompt, and click on it to open the Command Prompt. Type ping, space, and then enter an IP address, for example, 192. XXX. X.X. Examine the ping results to see the issue with your BT Smart Hub 2. 2. Use a VPN Packet loss is generally created by an unstable connection to the server. Whether you have internet issues or the server is not working properly, you might encounter packet loss or ping spikes.\nWith a VPN you can connect to a different server that works better. It’s completely safe and it also makes you untrackable for online threats. Our recommendation is ExpressVPN for its amazing features.\nHere is how to download and connect to a VPN (we’ll be using ExpressVPN as an example):\nVisit the provider’s website and download ExpressVPN. After the download ended, install the VPN then open it. Click on choose location and select from the list the server you want to connect to. After you connect to the server, feel free to check if any spike drop appears again. ExpressVPN is as simple as above, the connection is made in a few moments and it won’t affect your internet speed or PC performance. It has servers in over 90 countries so you are sure to find the right one for you.\n3. Restart your router Remove the modem and router from the power supply. Wait at least 15 seconds before proceeding. Plug the modem back into the power outlet first, then wait 1-2 minutes before turning it on. Wait for all of the panel lights on your cable modem to turn green before testing your internet connection. 4. Check the physical connections Make sure that all of the device connections are made appropriately. Connect all ports to the devices appropriately using the necessary cables. Packet loss will happen if the cable connections are incorrect and the connection is loose. 5. Use a wired connection Connect a laptop to the back of the Hub using a network cable. Launch your browser and visit a website of your choice. If this works, restart all your devices and then connect them again. 6. Check BT Broadband status Disconnect your phone from the Wi-Fi network. Connect it through mobile data to establish if there could be a problem in your area. If there is a problem, you can contact support or revert to a fiber optic cable and ethernet instead of Wi-Fi. How can I improve my broadband quality? You might need to switch to a new deal or provider if the speed you’re now receiving is far below what you require.\nExpressVPN Your online helper against lag spikes and packet loss for any connection.\nHowever, there are a few things you may do to boost the speed if you’re normally at ease with it. They include placing your router in a centralized location, choosing a wired connection over Wi-Fi, trying a wireless booster, giving your computer a spring clean, turning off Wi-Fi on all of your unused gadgets and if you are working from home you can switch your conference calls to audio-only.\nPacket loss is a relatively common network issue that can be caused by simple problems with the system software and cables, among others.\nIt cannot be totally eliminated; it can only be reduced by measures and the use of various instruments for network testing and monitoring. The fixes discussed above will help you deal with packet loss without any problems.\nYou can also use dedicated network monitoring tools which address owners of medium to large networks, as well as business clients.
