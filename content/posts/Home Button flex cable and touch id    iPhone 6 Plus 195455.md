Is your iPhone 6 Plus touch id not working? Shocking reason revealed!

If you own an iPhone 6 Plus and are experiencing touch ID issues, you might be surprised to know that the cause of the problem could be as simple as a dirty or damaged home button.

The touch ID system uses a fingerprint reader built into the home button to unlock your phone, access apps, and make purchases. If the home button is dirty or damaged, it can interfere with the touch ID system, causing it to stop working.

One common cause of touch ID issues is dirty or greasy hands. If you often use your iPhone with greasy fingers, this can leave residue on the home button that can interfere with the touch ID system. Similarly, if you frequently touch the home button with dirty hands, this can cause debris to accumulate in the button.

Another possible cause of touch ID issues is physical damage to the home button. If you’ve dropped your phone or otherwise damaged the home button, this can cause the touch ID system to malfunction or stop working entirely.

If you’re experiencing touch ID issues on your iPhone 6 Plus, there are a few things you can try to fix the problem. First, try cleaning the home button with a soft, dry cloth. This can remove any residue or debris that might be interfering with the touch ID system.

If cleaning the home button doesn’t work, you may need to replace the home button entirely. This can be done by an authorized Apple repair technician or at an Apple store. However, be aware that replacing the home button can be expensive and may not be covered by your warranty if the damage is due to user error.

In conclusion, if you’re experiencing touch ID issues on your iPhone 6 Plus, don’t panic! Often, the cause of the problem is simple and easily fixable, such as a dirty or damaged home button. Try cleaning the button with a soft, dry cloth, and if that doesn’t work, consider replacing the button with the help of an authorized technician.

## Chosen Solution
 I had to replace the home button flex cable that runs along the LCD shield plate due to damage from a broken screen. Home button works, but touch ID does not. Original button assembly. Only parts swapped were the LCD, home button flex and shield plate, and then the flex cable with the front camera and proximity sensor.
Any ideas on what to check? Reseated all of the connections a few times as well as resets and restores of the phone with no results. The flex cable was purchased elsewhere and not here.

 I would look for any damage to the home button flex, under a microscope if available. I would also try a different flex cable that runs along the shield, just in case there is a fault in the one you got.
Otherwise, it looks like you have done most other steps, rechecking the connections, and resetting the phone.

 Normally rebooting the phone will fix this.  Hold power and home until the apple appears, then release.  If that doesn't fix it, its more than likely damage to the flex cable attached to the home button, which I haven't found a way to fix.
