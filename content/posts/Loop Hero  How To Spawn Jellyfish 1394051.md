# Unleash the Power of the Ocean with Loop Hero's Secret Jellyfish Spawn Trick!

Are you tired of struggling to keep up with the other players in Loop Hero? Do you want to level up fast and dominate your enemies? If yes, then you are at the right place.

In this article, we will reveal the secret jellyfish spawn trick that will help you unleash the power of the ocean and triumph over your opponents.

But before we dive into the details, let's talk a bit about Loop Hero.

## What is Loop Hero?

Loop Hero is a popular game that combines elements of RPG, strategy, and deck-building. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world and requires players to build a loop around a boss monster, with each loop providing resources and enemies to fight.

The objective of the game is to clear the loop and defeat the boss monster, while simultaneously building a stronger deck and leveling up to unlock new cards.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the game, let's get to the secret jellyfish spawn trick.

## The Secret Jellyfish Spawn Trick

Jellyfish are powerful enemies in Loop Hero that can drop valuable items and resources upon defeat. However, they are also notoriously difficult to spawn.

Most players rely on placing rocks and mountains in the loop to spawn jellyfish, but this method is neither efficient nor consistent.

The secret jellyfish spawn trick involves using the power of the ocean to spawn jellyfish.

## How to Use the Secret Jellyfish Spawn Trick

To use the secret jellyfish spawn trick, you need to create a loop that contains water tiles. The more water tiles you have in the loop, the higher the chances of jellyfish spawning.

However, you can't just rely on the natural spawning of jellyfish. You need to manipulate the ocean's power to your advantage.

To do this, you need to place vampire mansions and vampire castles near the water tiles. These buildings have the power to summon sea creatures, including jellyfish.

The more vampire mansions and vampire castles you have near the water tiles, the more jellyfish will spawn.

Additionally, you can place blood groves near the water tiles to increase the chances of jellyfish spawning even further.

## Conclusion

The secret jellyfish spawn trick is an effective way to unleash the power of the ocean in Loop Hero and gain a significant advantage over your opponents.

By using the power of the ocean to your advantage, you can spawn more jellyfish and acquire valuable resources and items.

So, the next time you play Loop Hero, don't forget to incorporate the secret jellyfish spawn trick into your strategy and dominate your enemies.

## How to Spawn Jellyfish in Loop Hero
 
You yourself can’t spawn a Jellyfish in the game. Jellyfish are actually spawned by Sirens in the game. A Siren can summon a Jellyfish once every 3 attacks with her summoning ability. This happens after Chapter 3 in the game. Jellyfish act like Siren’s minions just like your Skeletons with the Necromancer ability. A Siren spawns once every Loop which consists of a Shipwreck tile.
 
A Jellyfish is a creature that is made exclusively and only of water. Due to this the Jellyfish perform slashing attacks on your character when they are summoned. However, since it is a minion itself its defences are pretty weak too. It has Liquid Traits. The abilities of a Jellyfish include Ambush, Friendly Fire, and Legionnaire. When killed the jellyfish will also drop Shapeless Mass as a resource you can use. You also stand the chance of getting an Encyclopedia when you fight them.
