Title: iPhone 6 Plus Owner Makes a Dangerous Mistake with U2402 Component - What Happens Next Will Shock You!

Introduction: The iPhone 6 Plus has been one of the most popular smartphones in recent times, with millions of people using it daily. However, there is a specific component in the phone that is not widely known, and an owner recently made a grave mistake with it. The consequence of the error will shock everyone who reads this article.

Problem statement: The U2402 component in the iPhone 6 Plus is a crucial component of the device's multi-touch system, making it possible for users to use the phone's screen effectively. In the case of the phone owner in question, he removed the component accidentally while attempting to repair a cracked screen. With the component removed, the phone became entirely unusable, and the consequences of this mistake were immediately evident.

Exposition: The U2402 component is a tiny microchip that controls the phone's touch functionality, enabling users to interact with the screen seamlessly. Its removal can have significant implications on the device's overall usability, rendering it useless. Unfortunately, that is what happened to an iPhone 6 Plus owner who attempted to repair his phone without prior technical knowledge.

The iPhone owner had noticed that his phone's screen was cracked and decided to repair it himself. On removing the front panel of the device, he accidentally removed the U2402 component, not realizing its importance to the phone's touch functionality. After reassembling the phone, the owner discovered that he could no longer use the screen. The phone's touch capabilities were entirely gone. Frustrated and unsure of what he had done wrong, the phone owner immediately contacted Apple support to get a solution.

The Apple support team quickly diagnosed the issue and informed the phone owner that the U2402 component had been removed, rendering the phone entirely unusable. Unfortunately, there was no way to recover the damaged part, and the only solution was to replace the entire phone's logic board since the U2402 component is not replaceable on its own. The owner was shocked and disappointed by the news, now making his phone repair decision even more costly.

Conclusion: The mistake made by the iPhone 6 Plus owner in removing the U2402 component was a costly one. It resulted in the complete loss of functionality of the phone, and it was impossible to recover without replacing the entire phone's logic board. This incident shows how crucial it is to have a proper understanding of the workings of such devices before attempting to repair them yourself.

It is also a warning to anyone who may consider tinkering with their iPhones without prior knowledge that the smallest component can render the entire phone useless. So, when things go wrong with your iPhone, it is best to seek help from professionals or qualified technicians to avoid costly mistakes. Indeed, the fallout from a well-meaning but ill-informed attempt to repair your phone can be costly and frustrating, as the unfortunate iPhone 6 Plus owner discovered to his disappointment.


## Chosen Solution
 So i got a iphone for touch ic today and changed u2401 with no problem checked the touchscreen everything seems good but still not responsive so i went on to change u2402 after i changed this it will not power on I am so confused right now so any help would be appreciated

 Go back to where it last worked. Remove U2402, make sure there are no bridges or components knocked off their pads... try to power up without the u2402 and see if you have power, if not, then remove u2401. Before putting back the IC's make sure pads are cleaned up and nothing is bridged and you have a good reball on both IC's. Then, make sure you run the M1 jumper on U2402 before placing it back. U2402 is the problem with no touch the majority of the time with u2401 the main cause of the grey flickering bar on top
Feel free to ask any questions
