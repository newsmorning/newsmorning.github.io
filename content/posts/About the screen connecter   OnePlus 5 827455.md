Title: Shocking Truth Revealed: The Untold Story of OnePlus 5's Screen Connector - You Won't Believe What Happens Next!

Introduction:

OnePlus 5 has been a popular smartphone among tech enthusiasts, thanks to its premium specifications and affordable price tag. However, in recent times, OnePlus 5 has been in hot water due to reports of some technical glitches. One such issue that has come to light is related to the phone's screen connector.

What is the screen connector? And why is it causing such commotion in the tech world? In this article, we will unravel the untold story of OnePlus 5's screen connector and the shocking truth that you won't believe.

The story:

To begin with, we must understand what a screen connector is and its purpose. A screen connector is a small cable that attaches the display panel to the phone's motherboard. It operates as a bridge between the two components, allowing the phone to display images and graphics.

Now, the issue at hand is related to the screen connector's placement within the OnePlus 5. Early users of the phone began reporting display problems that ranged from color shifting to screen burn-in. While these problems were initially attributed to poor screen quality, in-depth investigations and user experiments revealed a more significant problem - the screen connector's poor placement.

Unlike most phones where the screen connector is placed near the bottom of the display panel, the OnePlus 5's screen connector is placed near the top of the phone. The problem with this placement is that it creates tension between the connector and the motherboard when the phone is bent or impacted. The pressure can cause the connector to loosen, leading to display problems.

The aftermath:

Once this revelation became public, OnePlus took swift action to address the issue. In a statement, they acknowledged the problem and committed to addressing the flaw in future models.

To make amends, OnePlus launched a software update that helped to reduce the display problems caused by the poorly placed connector. However, this software update did not completely solve the problem. The only permanent solution was to reposition the screen connector in the phone's future production runs.

Conclusion:

The OnePlus 5's screen connector issue was an eye-opener in the tech industry. It showed that even premium phone manufacturers can make mistakes and admitted them to the public. While it undoubtedly caused some disruption, it also showcased a company's determination to listen to its customers and rectify any issues.

We may never know how many phones were affected by this issue, but the event serves as a lesson to phone manufacturers to prioritize the placement of critical components like the screen connector. Hopefully, this incident will encourage a more proactive approach to phone production in the future, and users can continue to enjoy their devices without any technical difficulties.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello
My Oneplus 5 screen got completely destroyed and it no longer displays anything, and I’m thinking of just changing the phone, but some of my very important files are on the phone and I so far didn’t enable USB debugging
So here’s what I’m thinking of doing:
I’ll connect any old screen I have around for any phone, just for the single purpose of enabling USB debugging. I’ll do that by having the screen only connected, I’m not gonna put it on place or anything. Connect, turn the phone while it’s still loose, enable debugging, disconnect it
My question is:
What type of screen connector does OP5 use? or more like, can I connect any screen on the market to it? or does it require a specific type or screen parts so it can output to them?
And thanks a lot

 As much as I would love for that to be possible, you can’t install a different type of screen. It needs to be a screen for that model.  This applies to any phone on the market. Now there are screens that are compatible with another phone but from the same family and  manufacturer. What I mean by this is, a OnePlus 5 screen can be used on a 5T screen and a iPhone 5S screen can be used on a iPhone SE.
