Unbelievable! Why Your Jbl Pulse Is Still Not Charging Even After Plugging In? You Won't Believe The Reason!

If you are a proud owner of the Jbl Pulse, congratulations! You have made an excellent choice. The Jbl Pulse is a portable Bluetooth speaker that offers excellent sound quality and a unique LED light show that syncs with your music. However, it can be frustrating when your Jbl Pulse is not charging, even after plugging it in. This is a common problem that people face, but you won't believe the reason why.

The first thing you should do when your Jbl Pulse is not charging is to check the charging cable. Make sure it is plugged in securely to the speaker and the power source. If the cable is damaged or faulty, it can prevent the speaker from charging. So, make sure that the cable is not tangled or broken.

If the charging cable is fine, the next thing to check is the power source. Make sure the power source is working correctly. Try plugging in a different device to the same power source to see if it works. If it does not work, then the problem is with the power source, not the Jbl Pulse.

However, if the power source is working fine, and the charging cable is intact, then the problem is most likely with the battery. Over time, the battery in your Jbl Pulse can degrade, which can prevent it from charging. When the battery is fully depleted, it can take longer to charge. In some cases, it may not charge at all.

If the battery is defective, the only solution is to replace it. Unfortunately, replacing the battery in the Jbl Pulse is not an easy task. It requires special tools and knowledge of electronics. If you are not confident that you can replace the battery yourself, it's best to take your speaker to a professional.

The Jbl Pulse is a fantastic speaker that provides excellent sound quality and a unique LED light show. However, like all electronic devices, it can develop faults over time. When your Jbl Pulse is not charging, examine the charging cable and power source first. If these are fine, then the problem is likely with the battery. If you need to replace the battery, seek the help of a professional. By following these steps, you can get your Jbl Pulse up and running again in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I just got my Pulse 2 yesterday, and I really enjoyed it. While it lasted. Now I can't charge it. I plug the cable in and I see the first little lamp start flashing white, which I thought was it charging (and I'm guessing it is), but I left it to charge over night, and when I came to take a look at it, it was still at the same charge. Have I done something wrong? I tried using the charger on my phone, and it worked flawlesly. (Although, I didn't use the actual USB cable, because I don't have a phone which uses this type of cable, only the dongle that you put in the wall) Any help would be appreciated.

 Since you got it yesterday, return it to the store and get a replacement. If you have the same issue, get a different speaker. If they dont accept the return, Contact JBL and see what they can do for you.
