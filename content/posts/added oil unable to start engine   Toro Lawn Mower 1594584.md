Title: The Shocking Truth About Oil and Your Toro Lawn Mower

Introduction:
As a lawn owner, you're probably familiar with the importance of keeping your lawn mower well-maintained. You ensure that its blades are sharp, its engine is clean, and you add fuel regularly to keep it running. But did you know that adding oil to your Toro lawn mower can actually cause it not to start? That's right - it's the shocking truth about oil and your Toro lawn mower that you won't believe.

Background:
Toro is a well-known brand that produces high-quality lawn mowers. These mowers are designed to be durable and long-lasting, with powerful engines that make cutting and trimming your lawn a breeze. However, one thing that many Toro lawn mower owners don't know is that adding too much oil to the engine can cause it to fail.

The Problem:
The problem with adding too much oil to your Toro lawn mower is that it can cause the engine to flood. This is because excess oil can seep into the combustion chamber and mix with the gasoline. When this happens, the ratio of fuel to air is thrown off, making it impossible for the engine to start.

Another problem is that excess oil can clog the spark plug. The spark plug is responsible for igniting the fuel and air mixture in the combustion chamber. If it's clogged with oil, it won't be able to create a spark, which means the engine won't start.

The Solution:
To prevent your Toro lawn mower from experiencing engine failure due to excess oil, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. This means checking the oil levels regularly and only adding the recommended amount of oil when necessary. Typically, Toro lawn mowers require 20 to 24 ounces of oil depending on the model, which is usually just enough to reach the full mark on the dipstick.

If you have accidentally added too much oil to your Toro lawn mower, there are a few steps you can take to fix the problem. First, remove the excess oil by draining it out of the engine. Then, let the mower sit for a few hours to allow any remaining oil to drain back into the crankcase. Finally, clean or replace the spark plug to make sure it's not clogged with oil.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, adding too much oil to your Toro lawn mower can cause serious engine problems, including the failure to start. It's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to ensure that you're not overfilling the engine with oil. By doing so, you can keep your Toro lawn mower running smoothly and effectively for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 engine was smoking added oil unable to get engine to start
Update (07/25/2017)
engine was smoking added oil still unable to get engine to start.

 Was the smoke white before you added the oil? If a lawnmower engine blows white smoke out its exhaust, it means that the engine is burning oil - meaning that there is too much oil in the engine. If you added more oil to your lawnmower after it already had more than enough, you're in for a bit of trouble.
