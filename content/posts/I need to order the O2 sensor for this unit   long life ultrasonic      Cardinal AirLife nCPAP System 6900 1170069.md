Is Your Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 on the Verge of Silent Death? Order Your O2 Sensor NOW!

If you're using the Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 for oxygen therapy, you already know how important it is to have a reliable system. However, over time, wear and tear can cause components to fail, putting your health and safety at risk. One critical component of the Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 that you need to keep an eye on is the O2 sensor. If your O2 sensor is failing or faulty, it can lead to serious health issues, including hypoxia, acidosis, and even death.

Here's everything you need to know about the O2 sensor in your Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 and why you should order a replacement right away if it's malfunctioning.

What Is an O2 Sensor, and What Does It Do?

An O2 sensor is a component in your Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 that measures the amount of oxygen in the air flowing to your mask. The sensor sends this information to the system's electronic control unit (ECU), which uses the data to regulate the oxygen supply to your lungs. If the O2 sensor detects a low oxygen concentration, it sends a signal to the ECU, which adjusts the oxygen flow to ensure you're getting the right amount.

Why Is O2 Sensor Failure a Concern?

O2 sensor failure is a crucial concern because it can cause oxygen flow to fluctuate, putting patients at risk of hypoxia (low oxygen in the blood) or acidosis (a buildup of acid in the body). These conditions can lead to confusion, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, and even death.

How Can You Tell If Your O2 Sensor Is Failing or Faulty?

Some of the signs of O2 sensor failure are:

- Fluctuations in oxygen saturation (SpO2) readings on your pulse oximeter
- Unusual sounds, such as hissing or whistling, coming from your Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900
- A sudden drop in oxygen flow while using your oxygen therapy equipment
- Inaccurate oxygen concentration readings on your Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 display

What Should You Do If Your O2 Sensor Is Failing or Faulty?

If you suspect that your O2 sensor is failing, it's crucial to order a replacement immediately. Fortunately, ordering a replacement O2 sensor for your Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 is easy and cost-effective. You can purchase a replacement sensor directly from the manufacturer or a trusted medical equipment supplier.

It's also essential to manage your oxygen therapy carefully and monitor your oxygen saturation levels using a pulse oximeter. If you notice any unusual changes in your oxygen concentration or oxygen flow, or experience any symptoms of hypoxia or acidosis, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

Conclusion

Oxygen therapy is critical for many patients with respiratory conditions, and the Cardinal Airlife Ncpap System 6900 is a reliable device for delivering oxygen to your lungs. However, keeping your system in good working order requires regular maintenance and replacement of faulty components, like the O2 sensor. If you suspect that your O2 sensor is failing, don't wait to order a replacement and protect your health and safety.


## Chosen Solution
 Do you stock this O2 sensor unit? Can you tell me where to order it?

 @greyson you need to give us the complete information about the make and model of the unit if it is different than the device you picked. You have chosen the Cardinal AirLife nCPAP System 6900 but mention something about “long life ultrasonic” which gets confusing. I can tell you for sure that iFixit does not have the O2 sensor in stock. We can possibly connect with our BioMed people who could help us to source what you need but we need complete information.
