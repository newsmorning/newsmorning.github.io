Title: You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Upgrade Your iMac Hard Drive - Here's What you Need to Know About EMC 2308!

Introduction:

Are you running out of storage on your iMac? Are you tired of having to delete files or move them to external hard drives? Well, you don't have to suffer anymore. Upgrading your iMac hard drive is surprisingly easy, and you can do it yourself. In this article, we'll talk about EMC 2308 and what you need to know about upgrading your hard drive.

What is EMC 2308?

EMC 2308 is the model number for the iMac that was released in early 2009. It was a significant upgrade from the previous model, with a sleek design, faster processor, and better graphics. However, it came with a 320GB or 640GB hard drive, which, by today's standards, is relatively small.

Why Upgrade your iMac Hard Drive

Upgrading your hard drive will give you more storage space, allowing you to store more files, photos, and videos. Additionally, a faster hard drive can improve your iMac's overall performance, making it feel smoother and more responsive.

What You Need to Upgrade Your iMac Hard Drive

Before you start upgrading your iMac hard drive, you will need the following:

1. A new hard drive: You can find compatible hard drives online or at your local electronics store. You'll want to make sure it's a 3.5-inch SATA-drive with at least 7200 RPM or higher, which will provide faster read/write speeds.

2. Screwdrivers: You will need a Phillips screwdriver to open your iMac, so make sure you have one available.

3. A SATA-to-USB adapter: You will need this to transfer your data from your old hard drive to your new one.

Upgrading Your iMac Hard Drive (EMC 2308)

Step 1:

Before you start, make sure you have backed up all your data, and you're working on a clean and flat surface.

Step 2:

Disconnect all cables, peripherals, and power cables from your iMac.

Step 3:

Turn your iMac over and remove the access panel, which is located on the bottom.

Step 4:

Use your Phillips screwdriver to remove the eight screws that hold the front bezel onto your iMac.

Step 5:

Use a suction cup to gently lift the front bezel off your iMac.

Step 6:

Locate the hard drive enclosure and remove the screws holding it in place.

Step 7:

After removing these screws, gently disconnect the power and data cables from your hard drive.

Step 8:

Use your SATA-to-USB adapter to connect your new hard drive to your iMac.

Step 9:

Copy all the data from the old hard drive to the new hard drive.

Step 10:

Disconnect the SATA-to-USB adapter and plug in the power and data cables to the new hard drive.

Step 11:

Put the hard drive enclosure back in place and screw it in.

Step 12:

Reattach the front bezel onto your iMac, screw it in place, and put the access panel back on at the bottom.

Step 13:

Reconnect all cables, peripherals, and power cables to your iMac.

Step 14:

## Chosen Solution
 My iMac's hard drive ST31000528AS is dead and I need replacement drive. Can someone help me on deciding which I need. I have to buy these and I do not know if they are compatible.

I have  iMac Intel 21.5" EMC 2308
Model A1311 / Late 2009 / 3.06 or 3.33 GHz Core 2 Duo processor

I'm worried about the third connector that is responsible for regulating the speed of transfer a 4-pin concetor to the bottom side of the cable is connected to the board also in forums indicate that regulates the speed of the internal fan of the mac so I need to know the compatibility since iriginal brought diso sata 2 and now there is a barracuda sata 3 https://www.pcfactory.cl/producto/25145-...

 @jeff5000 - Jamie your system has a SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) interface so you do need to be careful on what drive will work in your system.
A fixed SATA III (6.0 Gb/s) drive would not work reliably in your system so for starters lets push these HD's aside as not workable.
Now you can put in a fixed SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) drive but these are getting hard to find so lets put this option aside as well.
Instead lets look at a different type of drive we call auto sense! These drives unlike the fix'ed speed drives have the ability to match up to the systems I/O speed. Thats what I would get here.
So what drives are auto sense?. Here we need to look at the drives spec sheet to see what it has listed for supporting speeds. As an example the Seagate FireCuda Seagate Firecuda spec sheet lists supported SATA transfer speeds of 6.0/3.0/1.5. So this drive would work in your system. In addition as it's really a SSHD it will offer even better performance than a traditional HD as the built-in SSD cache will make booting up zip and can improve application performance as well.
As you noted there is a thermal sensor connection the (3rd cable). The problem is there are three different cables for the three different drives Apple had used (Hitachi, Seagate & Western-Digital). Today you can't get the exact drives Apple used while some of the newer ones still offer compatibility with the pinouts as an example if you have a WD drive and replaced it with a WD drive you might get the sensor to work.
Frankly, I don't like the gamble and in this case WD does not offer a workable SATA II drive any more any ways. So what to do??
Well, it turns out OWC offers a nifty replacement that will allow you to use any drive! Here's the cable OWC In-line Digital Thermal Sensor for iMac Late 2009 - Mid 2010 Hard Drive Upgrade

 Jaime, any SATA based 3.5 inch hard drive will be compatible with your system. Do keep in mind you will have to reinstall MacOS onto the new hard drive after the physical installation is completed.
Update (05/08/2018)
The third connector on the drive is for the temperature sensing, most hard drives currently available will have the extra connector.
