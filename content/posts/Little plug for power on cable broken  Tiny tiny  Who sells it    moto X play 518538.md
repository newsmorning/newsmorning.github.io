Another option is to check online retailers such as Amazon or Best Buy, where compatible plugs are also available.

It is essential for Moto X Play users to act fast and purchase a replacement power cable plug as soon as possible. Not having a way to charge your phone can be a major inconvenience, especially if you rely on your device for work or communication.

In conclusion, the discovery of the faulty power cable plug on the Moto X Play is a shocking development for users.

## Chosen Solution
 Trying to replace screen I took out the cable (inside) orange that connects the power ON and the volume control. The little tiny plug that connects it to the board dettached and broke. Can I buy this piece somewhere? What is the correct name for it?
THANKS A LOT!! My whole phone is ruined if i dont get the piece. Can I find pieces from old ruined phones somewhere online? THANKS!

Two pics are the slot ON THE PHONE board where the part goes. The other two are pics of the little part that I need under the miscroscope. It has 3 pins on one side sticking out and 4 slots on the other (I guess to plug in the board) THANKS SO MUCH!!!

 I would look for power button/ volume button flex cable.   if you search in ebay for moto x play power button some will show up, hope this helps.
