Next, open the Lost Ark game and start playing. Whenever you come across a cutscene or a dialogue that you want to skip, press the record button in your macro program, skip the cutscene by pressing the necessary keys or clicking your mouse, and then stop the recording. Assign a simple hotkey combination like Ctrl+Alt+S to your recorded macro.

Now whenever you encounter a cutscene or dialogue, just press the hotkey combination, and the macro program will automatically skip it for you. You'll save plenty of time previously spent waiting for cutscenes to end and have more time to explore the game, battle enemies, and level up your character.
