Attention iPhone 8 Plus users! Is your home button DEAD? Here's the secret fix you NEED to know NOW!

If you're an iPhone 8 Plus user, you may have experienced a dead home button. This issue can be frustrating, as it prevents you from easily accessing your home screen, multitasking, and even unlocking your phone. But don't worry, there is a secret fix you need to know now!

Apple has introduced a virtual home button on the iPhone 8 Plus, which functions similarly to the physical home button. This feature is called the AssistiveTouch, and it can be activated in a few quick steps.

Here's how to activate AssistiveTouch:

1. Go to Settings.

2. Select General.

3. Scroll down to Accessibility, then tap it.

4. Scroll down until you see AssistiveTouch, then toggle on the switch.

5. A small virtual button should appear on your screen. You can move it anywhere you prefer by dragging it with your finger.

Now that AssistiveTouch is active, you can use it to simulate the functions of the home button. Here are some ways to use AssistiveTouch:

- Single tap on the AssistiveTouch button to go back to your home screen.

- Long-press the button to activate Siri.

- Double-tap the button to bring up the App Switcher.

- Swipe left or right on the button to adjust the volume.

- Pinch and zoom on the button to activate the Reachability feature.

AssistiveTouch may not be as intuitive as the physical home button, but with a little practice, you can quickly get used to it. Moreover, it's better than having no solution at all and pay for a physical repair. 

If you're an iPhone 8 Plus user experiencing a dead home button, don't panic! Use the power of AssistiveTouch to simulate its functions and regain control over your device.

 Alright guys I’m about to just quick repairing screens on an iPhone 8+!!!! Today I did another and I know that for some reason the home button (touch id) does not work after repairing the screen.. Even if the button is the original from the phone… Ive read that maybe it’s cuz the “new” screen has a “bad” Touch ID connection. So I thought fine let me get a new one and by new I meant and “ORIGINAL” iPhone screen from a brand new phone to test that theory…. Replaced it and NOTHING. So can someone explain to me what in the big green world is going on??? I read somewhere that APPLE and ONLY APPLE has the rights to the Touch ID, which means that even if we try to replace it we may run into this problem since we disconnected it from it’s original screen. I need some answers!! As for now no more trying to repair the screens on these models. If anyone has any idea as to why this is let me know.

 It’s because you are prying the home button flex off the screen and damaging it. There is a chip right smack in the middle of the home button called your u10 chip (look it up on google) that is being damaged when you are transferring . That’s is why the button doesn’t work anymore . You can have a board level repair technician replace the chip or you can purchase a third pardty aftermarket home button return kit on eBay . As soon as you break the home button flex, it’s non repairable and apple would replace the entire phone…
With a successful repair, the home button will continue to work normally. Either the home button is damaged or the FPC connector is
