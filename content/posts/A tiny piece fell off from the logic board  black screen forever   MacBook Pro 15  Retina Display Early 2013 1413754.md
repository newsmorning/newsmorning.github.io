Are you a MacBook Pro user? If so, then you need to pay attention to this warning about one tiny piece that could render your laptop useless.

Recent reports have shown that users who have replaced their MacBook Pro's SSD with a third-party part are running into major issues. This tiny piece seems like a minor modification, but it's causing serious damage to the laptop's functionality.

So what's causing the problem?

Generally, Apple's MacBook Pro comes with a proprietary SSD that's integrated into the laptop's motherboard. However, some users have been replacing the built-in SSD with a third-party part – either because it's cheaper or because they believe it's the better option for their needs.

While replacing the SSD might seem like a simple upgrade, the reality is that it's not. The SSD is a critical component of the MacBook Pro system and any issues with it can have significant ramifications for the laptop's performance.

When you replace the SSD with a third-party piece, you're essentially hacking the system. Apple has designed the MacBook Pro's architecture in such a way that it won't function with unauthorized parts. When you alter the computer's configuration, you're offloading responsibility onto yourself – and that could spell disaster.

Some of the issues that users have run into include kernel panics - where the MacBook Pro simply shuts down and restarts. Others have seen their devices freeze up or even had their data wiped out entirely.

So what can you do about it?

The only real solution is to stick to Apple's proprietary parts when upgrading your MacBook Pro. This might mean paying a bit more for the upgrade, but it's much safer and much more dependable in the long run.

It's natural to want to save a few bucks on a laptop upgrade – especially when you're already shelling out a pretty penny for the device itself. However, the risks simply aren't worth it when it comes to replacing the SSD.

In conclusion, if you're planning on upgrading your MacBook Pro anytime soon, it's vital that you stick to Apple's proprietary parts. Doing so will save you a lot of headaches, frustration, and ultimately money in the long run. Don't let one small upgrade end up bricking your device – stick with the trusted solution to keep your MacBook Pro running smoothly for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi everybody . I replaced GPU thermal paste today and accidentally broke one GPU standoff on the logic board when I was tightening the screws.

And a tiny piece fell off from the logic board.

I actually tested my MacBook before I tightened the screws and it worked fine. But now just black screen when I turn it on, though  I can hear the startup chime.  What’s the name of that tiny piece?  How to put it back (or do I need to)?  Also is that possible that the broken piece and standoff cause black screen?
Thanks in advance!

 The part broken off is the capacitor C8505 which powers the PP1V35_GPU_FBVDDQ line going into the U8500 chip which appears to be a VRAM chip for the graphics chip.
That will need to be replaced as the VRAM chip is not getting sufficient power now.
C8550 info:
4.7UF6.3V20%X6S0402
