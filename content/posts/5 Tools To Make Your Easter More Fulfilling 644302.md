Yeah, it’s this time of the year that Christians all over the world celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ who is considered the center of the Christian Faith. To me, Easter is about celebrating the fact that God in all his glory and majesty left his heavenly throne to die for my sins. He did not have to do it, but he did and His motivation was LOVE as stated in John 3:16(For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life).
When Adam sinned against God and was consequentially thrust out of the garden of Eden, God is all His wisdom and love had a plan to redeem man kind from sin so as to restore a broken relationship. This was made possible through one man’s (Jesus Christ) righteous act. Now you can have Life everlasting if you accept the FREE gift of salvation through faith in this man. You don’t have to do anything to attain or earn it except to believe! That’s what easter is all about.
 
Now here are some of the [free] tools some of which I have personally used that can make you Easter and even other days fulfilling.
