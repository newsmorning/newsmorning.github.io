# Shocking: Apple's Biggest Flaw Yet! The New iPhone 6s Screen Home Button is a Complete Disaster

Apple has always been known for producing devices with sleek designs and innovative features. However, its latest release, the iPhone 6s, has already caused quite a stir among users. The new feature known as the "haptic touch" home button has been a complete disaster causing many users to question Apple's decision to roll out this feature on such a high-end device.

### What is the "Haptic Touch" Home Button?

The new "haptic touch" home button on the iPhone 6s provides a new level of interaction with the device. Instead of the traditional physical button, the iPhone 6s now uses a completely solid-state capacitance sensor. This button comes equipped with a new "taptic engine" providing subtle feedback when you press the home button, giving the user a sense of a traditional click while not having to physically move the button.

### The Downside of the "Haptic Touch" Home Button

The traditional button on the iPhone had a tactile feel that users have come to expect with each press. The new "haptic touch" home button has lost this feel altogether. When comparing the iPhone 6s to its predecessor, the iPhone 6, users noticed instantly that the new home button was different. The lack of a tangible click makes it feel like there is no response when you press the button. Many users say the "haptic touch" is an oversimplified gesture that doesn't have the same level of tactility they have grown accustomed to.

Also, the new home button is extremely susceptible to dust, which can interfere with its ability to operate effectively. This is something that Apple could have easily done without, considering that dust has always been a problem for iPhones as a result of their tight spaces.

### Is Apple Solving the "Haptic Touch" Home Button Problem?

Apple has issued an article on its website providing help to those experiencing issues with the new home button. It recommends the use of on-screen button alternatives and advises how to recalibrate the home button when it is not functioning correctly. However, users are still experiencing ongoing problems. It seems the only real solution is to return the device to Apple and either hope for a repair or request for a replacement unit.

### The Verdict

Apple's decision to replace the traditional home button with the new "haptic touch" button might have been innovative and forward-looking, but it was not typical of Apple's quality. The home button is a central feature of an iPhone, and losing its tactile feedback ruins the user experience. The move seems to have been one of the biggest flaws in Apple's history. It has certainly brought them negative feedback from users who are questioning whether Apple values innovation over quality. Are you trading in your old iPhone after this review?

## Chosen Solution
 Hey,
I replaced my broken screen with a New one. But when I tried the screen the homebutton did not respond, so I checken if i connected it propperly and i did. Then I transfered the Home button back to the broken screen and put it back on the iPhone and it worked just fine!
Does anybody know how to fix this problem?

 did the new screen come with the metal back plate and ribbon installed or did you transfer them over from the old lcd

 The new screen is not compatiable with the home button. This is usually do to software updates sent by Apple. There has been a fare share of problems with different components not working after replacing with a new screen. Apple doesnâ€™t want you to fix your phone, they want to fix.
