# Unlock the Secret to Downloading Facebook Videos Efficiently with These 5 Proven Methods!

In today's world, social media platforms like Facebook are an almost inseparable part of our lives. They provide us with all kinds of entertainment, including amusing videos shared by our friends and favorite pages. And let's be honest, who doesn't love to watch entertaining videos on Facebook?

While streaming videos on Facebook is easy, downloading them for offline viewing is a bit tricky. Most videos on Facebook are not available for download, and even if they are, the process is not straightforward.

In this article, we will discuss five proven methods to download Facebook videos efficiently. These methods are easy to follow and require no special skills.

## Method 1: Use a Third-party App/Website

The easiest method to download Facebook videos is to use a third-party app or website specifically designed for this purpose. Some of the most popular websites for downloading Facebook videos include fbdown.net, getfvid.com, and downvids.net. You just need to copy the video's URL from Facebook and paste it on any of these websites to download it.

If you prefer to use an app, Video Downloader for Facebook and Video Saver are good options for both Android and iOS users. These apps work the same way as websites and can save you time by allowing you to download the video directly from Facebook's app.

## Method 2: Use Built-in Browser Features

Modern web browsers like Chrome and Firefox also offer built-in features that let you download Facebook videos with ease. All you need to do is open Facebook in your browser, navigate to the video you want to download, right-click on the video, and select 'Save Video As...'

Keep in mind that this method works only on desktop computers and not on mobile devices.

## Method 3: Use SaveFrom.net Website or Extension

SaveFrom.net is a popular website and extension that allows users to download videos from various social media platforms, including Facebook. You can either copy the video's URL and paste it on the website or install the SaveFrom.net extension on your browser. Once the extension is installed, you can directly download the video by clicking on the 'Download' button.

This method works on both desktop and mobile devices, and the extension is available for all popular web browsers.

## Method 4: Use a Video Downloading Software

If you download videos from Facebook frequently, investing in a video downloading software can save you a lot of time and hassle. Some popular software options include 4K Video Downloader, YTD Video Downloader, and Freemake Video Downloader.

These software programs allow you to download videos from various platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and more. They also offer additional features such as downloading entire YouTube playlists, converting videos to different formats, and more.

## Method 5: Screen Recording

If all other methods fail, you can use screen recording tools to capture the Facebook video as you watch it. This method requires a bit more effort than the others, but it's a reliable way to download videos that are not available for download.

Screen recording is available on all smartphones and computers, and you can use software like OBS or Camtasia for a more robust recording experience.

In conclusion, downloading videos from Facebook can be tricky, but with these five proven methods, you can easily save your favorite videos for offline viewing. Whether you prefer third-party apps, built-in browser features, or video downloading software, there's a method for everyone. So go ahead and download those hilarious cat videos or cooking tutorials without any hassle!
