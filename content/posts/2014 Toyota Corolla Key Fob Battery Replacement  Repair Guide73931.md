# Revive Your Toyota Corolla in Seconds: Learn How to Replace Your Key Fob Battery with This Easy Guide!

The key fob is one of the essential parts of any modern vehicle, giving drivers easy and fast access to their cars without the need for traditional keys. If you own a Toyota Corolla and you notice that your car's key fob is not working correctly or if you're experiencing difficulties in unlocking your vehicle, then it might be time to replace your key fob battery.

Replacing a Toyota Corolla key fob battery might sound like a daunting task, but it's relatively easy and can be done in a few seconds. In this article, you will learn how to replace your Toyota Corolla key fob battery step-by-step, using the Hugo writing format.

## Step 1: Gather the Tools and Materials You Will Need

Before starting the battery replacement process, make sure that you have all the necessary tools and materials at hand. You will need the following:

- A replacement battery (CR2032)
- A small screwdriver
- A clean cloth or paper towel

## Step 2: Remove the Key Blade from Your Key Fob

The first step in replacing your Toyota Corolla key fob battery is to remove the key blade. The key blade is located on the side of your key fob and can be separated by holding the tiny button located near the base of the blade. Once the button is pressed, you can pull the blade out by holding the small RFID chip located in the middle.

## Step 3: Separate the Two Halves of Your Key Fob

After removing the key blade, use a small screwdriver to pry open the two halves of your key fob. There are two small tabs located on the sides of the key fob that you can use as leverage to separate the two halves gently. Once the two halves are separated, you can remove the old battery located inside.

## Step 4: Replace the Old Battery with a New One

Take the old battery out and replace it with a new one. Make sure that the positive side of the battery (marked with a + sign) is facing upwards, and the negative side (marked with a - sign) is facing downward. Slide the new battery carefully into the battery holder in your key fob.

## Step 5: Reassemble Your Key Fob

After replacing the battery, it's time to reassemble your key fob. Carefully align the two halves of the fob and push them together until they snap into place. Make sure that the tabs on the sides of the fob are correctly aligned with the grooves on the other side.

## Step 6: Reattach Your Key Blade into Your Key Fob

After you have reassembled your key fob, it's time to put your key blade back into your key fob. Align the small RFID chip with the slot in the key fob and push the blade into the slot. Once the blade is securely in place, test your key fob by pressing the buttons and checking if it responds correctly.

Congratulations! You have successfully replaced the battery in your Toyota Corolla key fob. The process is relatively simple and can be done in a few seconds. By replacing the battery in your key fob, you can save money and avoid the hassle of going to a dealership for a replacement.

Do I need CR2016 or can CR2032 work as well?
