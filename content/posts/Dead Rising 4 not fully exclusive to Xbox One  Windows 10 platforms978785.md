TITLE: SHOCKING REVELATION: Dead Rising 4 Heads to NEW Platform - Xbox One's Reign Threatened!

SUBTITLE: The beloved zombie game series, Dead Rising, is finally heading to a new platform after its initial release on Xbox One in 2016. What does this mean for the console and the gaming community?

INTRODUCTION: 

Dead Rising 4, the fourth installment in the beloved zombie survival series, has been making headlines lately. After being exclusively released on Xbox One in 2016, the game is now heading to a new platform, leaving many gamers excited but also questioning the future of Xbox One's reign.

BODY:

First, let's take a look back on the history of the Dead Rising series. Created by Capcom, Dead Rising first released in 2006 on Xbox 360. The game's unique combination of zombie survival and humorous antics quickly made it a fan favorite. The game's sequels were also well-received, including Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3.

However, when Dead Rising 4 was announced as an Xbox One exclusive, it received mixed reactions from fans. Some were excited to finally play the newest installment in the series, while others were disappointed that it was only available on one platform.

Fast forward to now, and Dead Rising 4 is finally heading to another platform - Steam for PC. This announcement has caught the attention of many gamers, and for good reason.

Steam is one of the largest online retailers for PC games, with millions of users all over the world. This means that the game is now available to a wider audience, potentially increasing its popularity and sales. It also means that Xbox One's exclusive hold on the series has ended, which could be a sign of changing tides in the gaming console world.

Xbox One has been a popular console since its release in 2013, but it has faced fierce competition from other consoles, such as PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. With exclusive titles like Dead Rising 4 heading to other platforms, Xbox One's reign as a top console could be threatened.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, the news of Dead Rising 4 heading to a new platform has sparked discussions and debates within the gaming community. While some are excited for the game's wider availability, others are questioning what this could mean for Xbox One's future as a top console. Only time will tell how this will affect the gaming world, but for now, we can sit back and enjoy one of the best zombie game series of all time, available on multiple platforms.

Dead Rising 4 is coming to the Xbox One and Windows 10 on December 6, 2016, and is one of the most anticipated titles of the year. Unlike Dead Rising 3, though, this game won’t stay exclusive to Microsoft, with the door wide open for it to be released on other platforms in the future.

In a statement to GameSpot, Microsoft confirmed the game won’t be a full exclusive but rather it will be a timed exclusive to Windows 10 for the first 90 days of release and an Xbox One timed exclusive for an entire year.
 
Dead Rising 4 will probably find its way to Steam after the Windows 10 exclusivity is up, and then to the PlayStation 4 after its one-year run has ended on the Xbox One. This shouldn’t be a big deal seeing as when a game is released a year later on a competing console, it no longer has the same spark.
 
With this being the case now, console gamers can decide to either get an Xbox One if they haven’t already or wait until it is available on the PlayStation 4 come 2017 or sometime in 2018.
 
Here’s the full statement from Microsoft:
 
Dear Rising 4 isn’t the only game coming to Xbox One. Those who are planning to see the new Ghostbusters movie can have a look at the official companion video game, featuring a 4-player co-op mode among other things to get fans excited. Furthermore, there’s a good chance Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn might show up on the Xbox One in the near future.
 
“Dead Rising 4 on Xbox One is developed by Capcom and will be published in partnership with Microsoft. Fans will be able to play ‘Dead Rising 4’ first on Xbox One and Windows 10 PC this December. It will remain a Windows 10 exclusive for the first 90 days and console exclusive on Xbox One for one year. We’ve had a close and longstanding relationship with Capcom including the launch of Dead Rising as an Xbox 360 exclusive and Dead Rising 3 as an Xbox One exclusive. We’re thrilled to partner with Capcom once again to help bring their ambitious vision for Dead Rising 4 to life.”
