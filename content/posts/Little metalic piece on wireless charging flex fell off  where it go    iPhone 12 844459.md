## What is the Metallic Piece of the iPhone 12 Wireless Charger?

The iPhone 12 wireless charger is built with high-quality materials and delivers an amazing charging experience. However, the metallic piece that comes with the wireless charger is designed to keep the charger at a specific angle while charging. It ensures that the device is held securely in place, while allowing for maximum charge rates. 

This little metallic piece is made of a high-quality alloy and is designed to provide the user with a strong grip. But, it seems like this piece falls off easily, causing a lot of frustration and worry.

## Why is the Metallic Piece Falling Off the iPhone 12 Wireless Charger?

There could be different reasons why the metallic piece is falling off the iPhone 12 wireless charger. Some users have reported that the adhesive used to stick it on was not strong enough. Others suggest that it could have been a manufacturing defect.

Whatever the reason, it's important to understand that this is a common issue among iPhone 12 wireless charger users. It is not a problem with the iPhone 12 or the wireless charger but an issue with the metallic piece itself.

## Solution to Fix the Metallic Piece Falling Off the iPhone 12 Wireless Charger

If you've encountered this issue, there are several ways to fix it. First, you could try using a strong adhesive to reattach the metallic piece. You could use superglue or any other adhesive that's strong enough to keep the piece in place.

Another solution is to contact Apple support and request a replacement for the metallic piece. Apple is aware of this issue and is willing to send you a new metallic piece free of charge.

Lastly, you could consider investing in a third-party wireless charger. The market is filled with an array of different wireless chargers that offer the same charging experience as the iPhone 12 wireless charger, but without the faulty metallic piece issue. 

To sum up, the little metallic piece falling off the iPhone 12 wireless charger is an issue that can be easily resolved.

## Chosen Solution
 Yah so i was removing the bacl glass on this iphone to replace it, also this little tiny metal piece fell off the charging flex, what is it? Is it important? And how do i put i back on/ do it need to? Note, the piece is magnetised so when i try to put in on to complete the circle  (see photos) the magnetism opposes it and move it in anither position everytime

 natedawg Looks like one of the magnets that surrounds the charging coil. Without it your charging coil is not going to work (align) properly
