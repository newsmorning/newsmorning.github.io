Are you considering replacing your iPhone 7 screen? If so, beware of the potential nightmare that could follow.

I recently decided to replace my iPhone 7 screen on my own. The instructions and videos I found online made it seem like a simple process that I could handle myself. However, after completing the replacement, I discovered that my home button was dead. After some research, I found out why and wanted to share my story to prevent others from making the same mistake.

The issue with the home button on the iPhone 7 is that it is paired with the motherboard of the device. This means that if the original home button is replaced, it will no longer work due to the pairing being broken. Apple designed the home button this way as a security measure, so it cannot be easily replaced by third-party repair services. 

The solution to fixing a dead home button after a DIY screen replacement is to either take the device to Apple, where they will replace the entire phone or to use an on-screen home button that can be enabled through the settings. The on-screen home button works by using the phone's touch screen to navigate the device instead of the physical button. 

After discovering this information, I wished I had taken my device to a professional repair service or Apple instead of attempting to replace the screen myself. With the cost of an iPhone 7 replacement from Apple being between $299-$349, it may seem appealing to perform the repair yourself or use a cheaper third-party repair service. However, the risk of damaging the home button and causing it to be unusable is too great.

In conclusion, be warned of the potential nightmare that comes with attempting to replace your iPhone 7 screen yourself. Remember that the home button is paired with the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced without causing issues. If you do decide to replace the screen yourself, be prepared to either use an on-screen home button or take the device to Apple for a full replacement. Save yourself the headache and potential additional cost by doing research and deciding if the DIY route is worth it.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I have just replaced the screen of an iPhone 7, i took the old and working home button and put it into the new screen, when i turn it on, the home button does not work.
I have also tried with the old screen and the old home button, it was working.
How can i solve this?
May it be due to a broken flat in the new screen?

 It could be, if the home button is still working on the old LCD,you should try a new one OEM (it means better quality) and check the results.
Always be careful cause this home button is so sensitive and fragile.
Good luck!
