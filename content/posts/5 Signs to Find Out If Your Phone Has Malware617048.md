Some types of malware are designed to display unwanted pop-ups and advertisements, often leading to malicious websites or download pages that could further infect your phone.

5. Battery Drains Quickly

Finally, if your phone's battery is running out of juice faster than usual, it may be a sign that there's malware lurking inside. Malware can use up a lot of your phone's resources, draining the battery faster than usual. If you find yourself charging your phone more frequently than before, it might be time to take a closer look at your phone's security.

What to do if you think your phone has malware?

If you suspect that your phone has malware, there are steps that you can take to protect it. Firstly, run a malware scan using a reputable antivirus app. This will help you identify and remove any malicious software on your phone. Additionally, be wary of clicking on suspicious links, downloading unverified apps, or sharing personal information with unknown sources. Finally, keep your phone's operating system up to date to ensure the latest security patches are installed.

In conclusion, malware is a real threat to your phone's security and can put your personal information at risk. If you notice any of the above signs, take immediate action to remove any malicious software and protect your device from further harm.
