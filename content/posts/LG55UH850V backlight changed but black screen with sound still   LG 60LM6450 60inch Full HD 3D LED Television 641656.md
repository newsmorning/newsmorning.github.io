Title: Shocking LG TV Mystery: Image Disappears But Audio Remains!

Introduction:

Picture this: You're sitting down to watch your favorite TV show on your brand new LG TV, all excited for the next episode. Suddenly, the image disappears but the audio remains! Now, you're left scratching your head in confusion and frustration. How can this happen? What could be causing this strange phenomenon?

As it turns out, this is a common issue that many LG TV owners have reported, and the root cause is not always apparent. In this article, we'll delve into the reasons behind this mysterious issue and explore possible solutions to help you get back to enjoying your favorite shows.

The Mystery:

One possible reason for this issue is related to the settings on your LG TV. Some models have a feature called "Eco mode" that automatically dims the screen when there is no movement detected in the room. If this setting is turned on, the screen may occasionally appear to turn off completely, but the audio will continue to play. To check if this is the culprit, navigate to your TV's Settings menu and disable the Eco mode.

Another plausible cause is an intermittent HDMI connection. This occurs when the HDMI cable connecting your TV to your device is loose or damaged. Check to ensure that the cable is securely connected and that there are no signs of damage. If you have multiple HDMI inputs on your TV, try switching to a different one to see if the issue persists.

Lastly, it's possible that your TV may need a software update. LG frequently releases updates to fix bugs and improve its products' performance. To check if a software update is available for your TV, navigate to the Settings menu > Support > Software Update > Check for Updates. If there is an update available, download and install it.

Conclusion:

The LG TV mystery of disappearing image but audio remains is not as complicated as it seems. Several reasons could be responsible for this issue, ranging from a loose HDMI connection to a dimming feature enabled in the settings. By checking these possible reasons and following the appropriate solutions, you can enjoy uninterrupted viewing on your LG TV again.

Don't let these baffling occurrences ruin the pleasure of watching your favorite shows. Troubleshoot and solve the issue today!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I’m wondering if anyone can help. We have an LG 55UH850V. The tv has a problem where the screen goes black and the sounds stays on, when looking at with a torch you can see an image. I have replaced the edge lit backlight and changed the power board but still have the same issue. Can anyone point me in the direction of what to try next? Could it be I’ve installed a faulty backlight? The metal strip at the bottom of the tv (where the backlight is) seems to get really hot. Should a backlight be hot? Could the main board also cause this issue?
Thanks in advance for any replies.

 is the back light inverter a seperat board or built into the power board? is it LED right? i dont think LED should be hot. is there a seperat lodgic board down there that might be pumping the heat out?

 Hi @lewyb
With some LG TVs there is an inverter board associated with the LCD panel i.e. part of the panel but I don’t know about your model.
Here’s a link to the service manual for your TV (I think). The translation seems to indicate that it is. It is a .rar type file and I haven’t downloaded it to check but maybe scan it for viruses first before opening it, just to be sure.
Usually LG service manuals have good troubleshooting flowcharts and some schematics to help find problems such as no video etc.
Hopefully this is of some help.
