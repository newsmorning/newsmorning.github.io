If you own a Kenmore Refrigerator 59669932011, and you hear a strange hissing sound coming from it, stop what you're doing immediately and take action. That hissing sound could be an indication of a refrigerant leak, and if left unattended, it can lead to a costly disaster.

Refrigerant leaks in a refrigerator can happen due to a variety of reasons. The most common reasons are wear and tear, accidental damage, or manufacturing defects. If a refrigerant leak goes undetected or unaddressed, it can cause significant damage to your Kenmore Refrigerator 59669932011, as well as your health.

A refrigerant leak can cause your refrigerator to work harder to maintain the right temperature, which can lead to an increased energy bill. Additionally, a leak can cause the compressor in your refrigerator to overheat, which can lead to the compressor failing, leaving you with no cooling at all. This will require a costly repair or even replacement of your refrigerator.

Another reason to take a refrigerant leak seriously is that it can be harmful to your health. Refrigerant leaks can release dangerous chemicals into the air, which can lead to headaches, nausea, and even respiratory problems. In severe cases, refrigerant leaks can cause asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning.

So, what should you do if you hear a strange hissing sound coming from your Kenmore Refrigerator 59669932011? First, turn off the refrigerator immediately, and unplug it from the power source. Next, contact a professional refrigerator repair service and explain the situation to them. They will be able to diagnose the problem and provide you with the right solution.

In conclusion, if you own a Kenmore Refrigerator 59669932011 and hear a strange hissing sound, take it seriously, and take immediate action. A refrigerant leak can lead to significant damage to your refrigerator, high energy bills, and even harm to your health. So, act fast and contact a professional refrigerator repair service to avoid costly disaster.


## Chosen Solution
 We often hear sort of a "hissing" sound inside the refrigerator.
I think it has to do with the cooling system and that it is normal.
But could you explain more what it is exactly?

 Hi @Ronnie Steele
What is the make and model number of the refrigerator?
As answered above, if the compressor is not running it may be that the refrigerator is in the auto defrost cycle. A heater  under the evaporator unit inside the freezer compartment (behind a panel) is turned on to melt any accumulated ice that has built up on the evaporator.
During the auto defrost cycle, the freezer temp is allowed to rise to 32F (0C) to allow the ice to melt. This process is sped up by turning on the heater. As you don't want the food to even begin to thaw. The whole process takes about 20 minutes and when the temp in the freezer reaches 32F (up from 0F or 0C up from -18C) the defrost thermostat operates and signals the control board to stop the defrost cycle, which then turns off the heater and restarts the compressor and evaporator fan again to cool the temps back down to the set temps. This is when the hissing may occur as during normal operation (not defrost cycle) the evap unit is a lot colder. This cycle occurs once every 8-11 hours depending on the manufacturer.

 Water Inlet Valve
If the refrigerator is noisy or loud, particularly when the ice maker is filling, the water inlet valve is at fault. Replace it.
UPDATE
A cracking or popping sound can be heard when evaporator coils on Top Mount No Frost models are cooling after defrost. Buzzing noises can be heard after getting water from the door dispenser. ... The noise could last for 3 to 5 minutes. A hissing, sizzling, buzzing, or arching noise may be heard on self-defrost models.
The sound of hissing in a refrigerator is caused by the activation of something called a thermostatic expansion valve.  If coolant was constantly flowing through the copper coils in the rear of the fridge it would get too cold and you'd both waste power and everything inside would freeze.  So to maintain the proper temperature there is a valve which only allows coolant through at the appropriate times.  The valve itself does this by using the same basic principle as a thermometer.  That is, when a substance gets cold it contracts and when it gets hot it expands.  So when the fluid in the valve gets warm enough the fluid in it expands slightly and just barely unblocks the port allowing a small amount of coolant to hiss out.  Then when it gets cold again the valve closes maintaining the refrigerators temperature.
