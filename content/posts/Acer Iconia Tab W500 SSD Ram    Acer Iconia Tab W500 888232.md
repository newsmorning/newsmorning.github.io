## Chosen Solution
 Is there a way to replace the SSD on the Acer Iconia Tab W500 and the Ram? I want to replace the SSD with a 1TB instead of using the 32gb one.

 Acer W500 uses mSATA ssd. Currently you can upgrade it upto 128GB. Regarding RAM, as per C50 processor specification, you can upgrade it upto 4GB but the existing 2GB ram sitting behind the processor and it is soldered to it.
I have upgraded my SSD to 64GB, but I did not upgrade the RAM.
I really enjoy using this tablet.

 Hi,
The Iconia Tab uses mSATA SSD drive, so is it possible to upgrade SSD to 128-256 GB, but not more because is not available 1TB SSD.

 I recently upgraded my W500 SSD to a Mushkin 240GB mSATA with no issues.
Only requirement was first flashing BIOS with latest version from Acer

 I have not found anyone that has torn it apart but you can check the forums at http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/acer/
