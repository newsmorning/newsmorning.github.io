But when you slow down and think through things, you set yourself up for success.\n4.

In such a situation you will require to use some persuasion in the form of hurling something at the obstacle in question. While you won’t have a gun in your hand you can still shout out “Say hello to my little friend” in your best Al Pacino voice. The common objects that you will need to break are usually glass windows or sketchy photo frames that are hiding a hole in the wall. Here are some instructions on how to do just that.\nTo pick up an object you will have to click R2. Now some objects need to have something thrown at them to get them out of the way while some need to be attacked with an object to clear it out of your path. You need to keep pressing R2 while dragging or pushing the object you are going to use.\nNow to throw something you will need to click on X or A whereas you click Y when you have to attack something with the object you’re carrying.
