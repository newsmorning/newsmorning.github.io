Title: The Shocking Tale of a Dysfunctional iPad Mini 3 Screen Replacement

Introduction: 

Technology is an essential part of our lives, and it can be frustrating when it gets in the way of our daily activities. For instance, a cracked screen on your iPad Mini 3 can be bothersome, which is why screen replacement is an option. However, things can go wrong after replacement, especially when it comes to the home button and touch ID, which are vital features of the device that facilitate access and security.

Body:

Recently, a story emerged of an iPad Mini 3 screen replacement gone horribly wrong. After getting the cracked screen fixed, the home button and touch ID on the device stopped working altogether. The owner of the device was beyond frustrated and couldn't believe what had happened.

On further investigation, it became evident that the issue was with the third-party repair shop that had replaced the screen. It was discovered that they had damaged the touch ID sensor during the process, which had caused the malfunction. The owner of the iPad Mini 3 was understandably upset, especially since they had to pay for the replacement service.

It is crucial for users to be careful when dealing with third-party repair shops, as they may not have the same level of expertise as the original device manufacturer. Saving a few bucks on screen replacement can lead to more significant problems later on, as we have seen in this story.

Moreover, there is also the issue of using non-genuine parts during repairs, which can cause more problems than solutions. These parts may not be compatible with the device, which can lead to malfunctioning features like the home button and touch ID.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, it is crucial for users to be careful when seeking screen replacement services, especially when dealing with third-party repair shops. Before trusting your device with anyone, ensure that they have the expertise and experience required to handle it correctly. Additionally, it is vital to use genuine parts during repairs to ensure compatibility and prevent any further damage. By following these simple tips, you can avoid the shock and frustration that comes with a dysfunctional iPad Mini 3 screen replacement.

## Chosen Solution
 i just did a screen replacement on a ipad mini 3.  Now the home button and the touch id is not working.  now, before the screen replacement, i did not test the touch id to see if its working, assume its working, also the home button was very hard to use, before the screen replacement, have to press very hard for the home button to work.
i re-seat all the cable, lcd and digitizer is ok, just the home button not working, upon startup, there is a pop-up that said something about touch id not available.
Anything i can do to fix it?
anyone experience this problem?

 If you did the repair yourself, make sure all of the cables are connected properly and the back cover holding the home button in place is screwed in tightly enough.
If you had replaced the home button with another, Touch ID will no longer work due to Apple's technology and only their company can fix the feature itself.
