Title: The Ultimate Solution to Lost Cords: Getting Them All Back!

Introduction:
Have you ever had a situation where you lose something important and you feel hopeless that you will never find it? Well, that's what happened to me. One day, I lost all the cords for my Lepan Mini Model 802A Le Pan II. I felt frustrated, scared, and confused about what to do. In this article, I will share with you how I got them back using an ingenious method.

Body:
Firstly, I had to do some research to find out where I could buy new cords for my device. I searched online, enquired from friends, and even visited different stores, but it seemed like I couldn't find them anywhere. I was about to give up when I stumbled upon a unique idea. I thought about recycling old cords that I no longer used, and it was a breakthrough!

I remembered that over the years, I had accumulated a lot of old cords from my previous devices. After digging through my old storage bin, I found some cords that looked familiar to the Lepan Mini Model 802A Le Pan II. At first, I was skeptical that they would work, but I decided to give it a try.

I plugged the cords in, and to my amazement, they worked perfectly! I was overjoyed that I had found a solution to my problem. The charging dock, data transfer cord, and audio cord were all replaced with the cords I had salvaged from previous devices.

Conclusion:
Losing cords can be challenging, but there are ways to find an alternative solution. In this situation, it was recycling old cords that provided the ultimate solution. It not only saved me the trouble of searching for new cords, but it also saved me money. Instead of buying new cords, I had recycled what I had, and it had worked perfectly. Next time you lose your cords, don't panic - try recycling old ones!


## Chosen Solution
 My friend gave me this LePan Mini but I need all of the cords and charger can I purchase them through you?

 Hi,
Unfortunately ifixit does not stock what you need.
Hereâ€™s a link that shows what you need.
Alternatively if you already have a 5V DC 2A (2000mA) wall adapter (specifications are printed on the adapter - check output specs) which has a micro USB connector you can use that. Also if you have a standard micro USB to USB cable  you can use that to connect the tablet to a computer to charge it and to transfer data etc. Charging it this way will be slower and take longer than if you charge it with the adapter as computer USB ports only supply 0.5A (500mA)
