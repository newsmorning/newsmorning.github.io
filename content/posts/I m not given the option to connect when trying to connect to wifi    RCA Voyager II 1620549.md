## Chosen Solution
 The connect bar is grayed out when I try to connect to my wifi ? What can I do?

 Hello Treehousierirc
Make sure you have typed the right password as a lot of devices now check the password in real time (as you type)Also if you are using WPA and WPA2 you must have a minimum of 8 characters.If this doesn't help try another device to make sure that connects to the same wifi AP.You can also test by WiFi tethering your tablet to your phone.
Hope this helps.
