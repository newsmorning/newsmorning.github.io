Title: You Won't Believe the Shocking Liquid Detection Glitch Plaguing Samsung Tab S6 Lite and Galaxy Tab S6!

If you recently purchased a Samsung Tab S6 Lite or Galaxy Tab S6, you might want to take a closer look at the liquid detection feature. Reports suggest that a glitch is affecting these devices, causing them to incorrectly detect moisture and liquid damage, even if there's no actual liquid involved.

According to user complaints posted on forums and social media, many Samsung Tab S6 Lite and Galaxy Tab S6 devices are showing false-positive readings for liquid damage. This glitch is causing considerable frustration and inconvenience for users who thought they were buying a high-quality, reliable tablet but are now facing unexpected repair costs or even replacement requests.

So, what is causing this glitch? As per Samsung, the devices use a moisture detection strip located in the charging port to detect any moisture that may have come in contact with it. This is a handy feature that helps prevent damage to the device in case you accidentally spill water or other liquids. However, many users are reporting that their devices are showing false-positive readings even when there's no liquid involved.

The issue may stem from a software malfunction that's causing the devices to misinterpret the data collected by the moisture detection strip. Some users have reported that their devices showed a moisture warning even when it was in a dry environment, while others have experienced the warning after light usage.

In some cases, the warning disappears after a few moments or when the device is rebooted. In other instances, it stays on even after the device is completely dry. So, what can you do if you have been affected by this glitch?

If your Samsung Tab S6 Lite or Galaxy Tab S6 shows a moisture warning and you are certain that the device hasn't come into contact with moisture or liquid, it's best to take it to a Samsung service center. The technicians will inspect the device and determine if any actual damage was caused by liquid. If it's a false alarm, they will reset the device's moisture sensor, and the warning should disappear.

Samsung has stated that they are aware of the issue, and the company is working on finding a solution to the problem. If you purchased a Samsung Tab S6 Lite or Galaxy Tab S6, ensure you take proper care of it and be mindful of the liquid detection warning. However, if you feel that the warning is a false alarm, don't hesitate to take it to a Samsung service center for inspection.

In conclusion, the Samsung Tab S6 Lite and Galaxy Tab S6 are excellent tablets that offer a wide range of features and functionalities. However, this glitch with the liquid detection feature is causing considerable inconvenience for users. We hope Samsung will find a viable solution to the problem and continue providing users with high-quality tablets that meet their expectations.

## Chosen Solution
 My S6 Lite developed a charging issue after a few months.   It would respond to the cable plugging in but the battery charge would not increase.   Nor did it decrease as long as plugged in.  I could use the table for hours at 5% charge while plugged in.
Swapping cables and chargers, cleaning the port made no difference, it always recognizes that it’s plugged in but shows zero amps of actual charge current going to the battery.    I worked through some steps with Samsung support and it seems that it’s probably a faulty charge controller inside.  .    I sent it to the Samsung repair center under warranty but they rejected it as the indicator has changed.  I live on a tropical coast and it’s 99.9% humidity in rainy season.  But tablets and laptops do fine for years and years.  Problem is that the humidity trips the indicator and then there’s no warranty service as the company considers the indicator to be 100% accurate, so it must be water damage is their contention.
Two questions:
1) how do we get these companies to realize that their indicators are not 100% accurate and that they are losing customer due to bad service based on indicators.  I, for one, will never buy Samsung again due to refusal to repair using indicator as reason.
2) How can I repair this S6lite with a failed charge controller?
Thanks!

 S Lewis since we really can’t be sure it is the charging circuit, I’d suggest you disassemble it and follow the troubleshooting according the what Samsung has to say. I know it’s tedious and a pain but maybe you can get it going again. these manuals should help you with that. Disassembly Reassembly SM P610Troubleshooting SM P610
