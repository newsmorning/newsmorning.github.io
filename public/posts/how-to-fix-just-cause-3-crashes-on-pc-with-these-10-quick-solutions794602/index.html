It’s known for its explosive gameplay, stunning visuals, and vast open-world environment. However, some players have reported experiencing Just Cause 3 crashes on PC. These crashes can be a frustrating experience, and they can occur randomly, ruining your gaming session entirely. But fear not, as we bring you the ultimate guide to banishing Just Cause 3 crashes on your PC for good!\nFirstly, let’s understand why these crashes are taking place. Many factors can cause Just Cause 3 crashes on PC, such as outdated drivers, anti-virus software conflicts, or even incorrect game settings. The most common reasons for these crashes are outdated or faulty graphics drivers, overheating of the CPU or GPU, and insufficient system resources.\nThe fundamental fix to all these issues is to ensure that your PC meets the game’s system requirements. Just Cause 3 on PC requires a minimum of 8GB ram, a 2GB graphics card, and an Intel Core i5-2500k 3.3 GHz CPU. So, ensure that your PC meets these requirements or has higher specs for optimal gaming performance.\nAnother simple yet effective fix for Just Cause 3 crashing on PC is to update all device drivers and software on your computer. video card driver, motherboard drivers, and DirectX should be updated to the latest version. Updating drivers is easy, and you need to visit the manufacturer’s website and download the latest version of the drivers.\nFurthermore, ensure that your anti-virus is not conflicting with your gaming session. Many times, anti-virus and firewall software can interfere with the game’s processes, causing crashes. The solution is to temporarily disable these tools while playing the game. Most anti-virus software has a gaming mode that disables security features while you play your favorite games.\nOverheating is another reason for Just Cause 3 crashing on PC. If your PC is overheating, the game will not be able to run correctly, leading to crashes. Ensure that your PC has proper ventilation and is free from dust. Additionally, you can download a program called MSI Afterburner, which regulates the temperature of your GPU and CPU by adjusting their fan speeds.\nLastly, check that your game’s graphic settings are optimal for your system. High graphics settings require more system resources. If your PC is not powerful enough to run the game on high settings, it may cause frame drops or crashes. Lowering the graphics settings can potentially help reduce the strain on your system, leading to less crashing.\nIn conclusion, Just Cause 3 is a great game, but it can be frustrating when it constantly crashes on your PC. The best approach is to ensure that your PC has the necessary specs to run the game, update all drivers and software, check that anti-virus software is not interrupting your game, and ensure that your machine is not overheating. By following these simple tips, you can enjoy this explosive game without any crashes. Happy gaming!\nJust Cause 3, the sequel to the highly-successful Just Cause 2, adds another layer of fun and improves on the amazing in-game mechanics with the superb graphics.\nJust Cause 3 is the latest addition to an interesting niche of action-adventure games.The developer failed to optimize the game for the Windows platform and many users reported certain issues on Windows 10.Take a look at our Windows 10 Hub for helpful solutions to many other tech-issues.Check out our Gaming section to discover the latest news, best guides and reviews for an ultimate gaming experience.\nCPU, RAM and Network limiter with hot tab killer\nIntegrated with Twitch, Discord, Instagram, Twitter and Messengers directly\nBuilt-in sound controls and custom music\nCustom color themes by Razer Chroma and force dark pages\nFree VPN and Ad blocker\nDownload Opera GX\nHowever, since this game, like so many others, is a port from the Xbox One, the developer failed to optimize the game for the Windows platform and Just Cause 3 is plagued by crashes.\nIn addition, Just Cause 3 for PC has a lot of issues, including lags, stutters, FPS drops. We made sure to provide you with the in-depth list of all the common solutions we run into. Make sure to give them a try.\nHow can I fix Just Cause 3 if it crashes in Windows 10? 1. Check drivers The game works badly on numerous Nvidia graphics cards for some reason. Now, there’s only so much you can do when the game port is far from perfect.\nOn the other hand, making sure that you have the latest GPU drivers and associated software installed might help the cause (pun not intended).\nThe GPU driver provided by Windows Update doesn’t work as intended a lot of times.\nThe best way to ensure that the GPU software is proper is to download and install drivers from the official support website.\nHere are 3 websites of major OEM’s where you should be able to find everything you need:\nNVidia AMD/ATI Intel If you don’t want to manually search for drivers, you can always use a third-party tool such as DriverFix.\nDownloading drivers manually is a process that carries the risk of getting the wrong driver installed, which may lead to serious malfunctions.\nThe safer and easier way to update drivers on a Windows computer is by using an automatic software.\nWe strongly recommend the DriverFix tool to update your drivers in order to avoid the damage to your PC by manually downloading the wrong driver versions.\nThis great tool was developed so that you do not have to worry about manually downloading and installing your drivers yourself.\nAlready installed drivers can also be stored in an archive and used, for example, when the system is restored.\n2. Check the system requirements DriverFix DriverFix is the perfect software that doesn’t require any effort from you and will always keep your drivers up to date.\nThe optimal solution for the majority of issues is quite common for badly optimized console-to-PC ports. When in trouble, add more RAM.\nThe majority of problems in Just Cause 3 for PC appear due to memory leakage, where the game eats up all your physical memory which results in lags, stutters, and eventually crashes.\nSome suggest at least 16 GB of RAM, which is seemingly an overkill, based on the official system requirements.\nHere are the minimum and recommended system requirements for Just Cause 3:\nMinimum:\nOS: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required) CPU: Intel Core i5-2500k, 3.3GHz / AMD Phenom II X6 1075T 3GHz RAM: 8 GB RAM GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 (2GB) / AMD Radeon HD 7870 (2GB) HDD: 54 GB available space Recommended:\nOS: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required) CPU: Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHz RAM: 8 GB RAM GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB) HDD: 54 GB available space 3. Install the latest patch This game port for PC is quite poorly optimized. A lot of users with Nvidia GPUs have had a hard time enjoying the game.\nBut the number of affected users substantially dropped after a few patches. That’s why we suggest updating the game and, hopefully, the problems will be sorted out.\nThe first major patch (1.02) hasn’t fixed a thing, but a few coming afterward have dealt with the game performance and reduced crashes.\nThe game updates automatically through the Steam desktop client, so make sure to start the game from there. Once you’ve acquired the latest update, give Just Cause 3 another try.\nSome PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.\nExpert tip:\nSPONSORED\n4. Disable Superfetch service In the Windows Search bar, type services, and open Services. Find Superfetch, right-click on it and open Properties. Under the General tab so to Startup type, and select Disabled. Confirm changes and restart your PC. The Superfetch technology is there to predict your actions and speed up the loading of applications in the Windows shell.\nHowever, this technology works great with the standard HDD, and fast RAID arrays or SSDs don’t need it.\nThat’s why we suggest disabling Superfetch’s dedicated service, especially if you have an SSD.\nYou can always manage your startup apps so that you remove programs from the Startup and only keep those you need.\n5. Disable NDU Create a system restore point. In the Windows Search bar, type Regedit and open the Registry Editor ss admin. Navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMControlSet001ServicesNdu Right-click on Start and choose Modify. Change its value to 4 instead of 2 and confirm changes. Restart your PC. NDU (Network Diagnostic Usage tends) to affect the Non-paged pool, which will lead to abnormal RAM usage.\nYou’ll barely notice this on some undemanding applications, but since Just Cause 3 already takes a massive portion of RAM, we suggest disabling it.\nWe strongly advise to act cautiously and follow the instructions closely. Misuse of the Registry might lead to critical system issues.\nCan’t access the Registry Editor? Check out this guide and solve the issue quickly.\n6. Disable background processes In the Windows Search bar, type msconfig and open System Configuration. Under the Services tab, check the Hide all Microsoft services box. Click Disable all. Select the Startup tab and go to Task Manager. Prevent all programs from starting with the system and confirm changes. Restart your PC. Besides the system features we enlisted, you can try disabling or limiting the background processes. So, when you start the game, make sure that nothing which comes hard on system resources works in the background.\nYou can regulate programs that start with the system in System Configuration settings.\nMost users have no idea how to deal with a slow Task Manager. Don’t be one of them and read this quick guide to learn how to make it faster!\n7. Start the game with the unplugged controller Some users suggested that the controller was the one causing Just Cause 3 crashes on Windows 10.\nThey managed to resolve this by simply starting the game while the controller was disconnected.\nAfterward, they plugged it in and configured button mapping in the game. And, believe it or not – no more crashes.\nIf your PC is performing poorly while running one of your favorite games, then you may want to consider investing in one of these game booster software for Windows 10.\n8. Disable VSync/graphics extras and use lower graphics settings Even if you have a gaming rig fully capable of running Just Cause 3, the fact that the game is badly optimized for the Windows platform suggest disabling all unnecessary graphics extras. Including the VSync and shadows.\nAlso, lowering graphics settings a notch might save you as well, or at least to some extent, reduce game crashes.\nIf you’re unable to do so in the in-game settings, you can navigate to the Configuration Settings file and change them there.\n9. Check the game integrity via the Steam client Open Steam’s Library. Right-click on Just Cause 3 and open Properties. Choose the Local files tab. Click on the Verify the integrity of game files option. Restart your PC and start the game from the Steam desktop client. 10. Reinstall the game Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you resolve the issue at hand, we can only suggest going for a reinstallation.\nThis, of course, won’t do miracles, but a fresh start is the last one you can do on your own. The rest lies in the hands of the developers of Just Cause 3.\nReinstalling the game via Steam is as simple as possible, but we also suggest deleting the Setting file from the Saves. That way, you’ll start with a clean slate state of the game.\nHopefully, you were able to at least reduce Just Cause 3 crashes by following the enlisted steps.\nIf you have any alternative solutions or questions concerning Just Cause 3 crashes on the Windows platform, feel free to tell us in the comments section below.\ngame fixjust cause 3 Email *\nCommenting as .

When in trouble, add more RAM.</p><p>The majority of problems in Just Cause 3 for PC appear due to memory leakage, where the game eats up all your physical memory which results in lags, stutters, and eventually crashes.</p><p>Some suggest at least 16 GB of RAM, which is seemingly an overkill, based on the official system requirements.</p><p>Here are the minimum and recommended system requirements for Just Cause 3:</p><p>Minimum:</p><ul><li>OS: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)</li><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-2500k, 3.3GHz / AMD Phenom II X6 1075T 3GHz</li><li>RAM: 8 GB RAM</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 (2GB) / AMD Radeon HD 7870 (2GB)</li><li>HDD: 54 GB available space</li></ul><p>Recommended:</p><ul><li>OS: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)</li><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHz</li><li>RAM: 8 GB RAM</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)</li><li>HDD: 54 GB available space</li></ul><h3 id=3-install-the-latest-patch>3. Install the latest patch<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-install-the-latest-patch>#</a></h3><p>This game port for PC is quite poorly optimized. A lot of users with Nvidia GPUs have had a hard time enjoying the game.</p><p>But the number of affected users substantially dropped after a few patches. That’s why we suggest updating the game and, hopefully, the problems will be sorted out.</p><p>The first major patch (1.02) hasn’t fixed a thing, but a few coming afterward have dealt with the game performance and reduced crashes.</p><p>The game updates automatically through the Steam desktop client, so make sure to start the game from there. Once you’ve acquired the latest update, give Just Cause 3 another try.</p><p>Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.</p><p>Expert tip:</p><p>SPONSORED</p><h3 id=4-disable-superfetch-service>4.

Including the VSync and shadows.</p><p>Also, lowering graphics settings a notch might save you as well, or at least to some extent, reduce game crashes.</p><p>If you’re unable to do so in the in-game settings, you can navigate to the Configuration Settings file and change them there.</p><h3 id=9-check-the-game-integrity-via-the-steam-client>9.

The rest lies in the hands of the developers of Just Cause 3.</p><p>Reinstalling the game via Steam is as simple as possible, but we also suggest deleting the Setting file from the Saves. That way, you’ll start with a clean slate state of the game.</p><p>Hopefully, you were able to at least reduce Just Cause 3 crashes by following the enlisted steps.</p><p>If you have any alternative solutions or questions concerning Just Cause 3 crashes on the Windows platform, feel free to tell us in the comments section below.</p><ul><li>game fixjust cause 3</li></ul><p>Email *</p><p>Commenting as .
