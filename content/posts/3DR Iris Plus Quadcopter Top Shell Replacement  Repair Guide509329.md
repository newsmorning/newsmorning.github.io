# You won't believe how easy it is to fix your 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter with this Top Shell Replacement Guide!

If you are having trouble with your 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter, the problem could be as simple as a damaged top shell. The good news is that you don't need to buy a new drone. Replacing the top shell is an easy and affordable approach that can get your quadcopter back in action without any hassle.

In this guide, we'll take a closer look at the reasons why you might need to replace the top shell on your 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter, review the materials and tools you'll need for the job, and provide a step-by-step process for making the replacement.

## Why replace the top shell?

The top shell of your 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter is designed to protect its internal components from damage. However, there are times when the shell itself can become damaged and need to be replaced. For example, a crash or hard landing can cause it to crack, deform or even break completely.

Replacing the top shell is a simple and cost-effective solution that can save you money in the long run. By doing so, you can avoid the need to buy a new drone, which can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

## What you'll need

Here are the materials and tools you'll need to replace the top shell on your 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter:

- Replacement top shell
- Screwdriver
- Pliers (optional)
- Razor blade or knife
- Heat gun or hairdryer (optional)

## Step-by-step process

Follow these steps to replace the top shell on your 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter:

1. Remove the battery from your quadcopter to avoid any electrical hazards while working.

2. Unscrew and remove the four screws holding the top shell in place using your screwdriver.

3. Carefully lift the damaged top shell off of the drone's body. If it's stuck, you can use pliers or a razor blade to help separate it.

4. Take a close look at the internal components and make sure that there is no damage. If you notice any damage, you may need to assess the extent of the damage and take necessary steps to repair or replace.
 
5. Place the new top shell onto the 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter. Make sure it's aligned correctly and snug against the body.

6. Insert the screws back into their respective holes and tighten them with your screwdriver.

7. Reinstall the battery, and you're done!

If you find that the top shell is not snug or tightly fastened, you can use a heat gun or hairdryer to gently heat the plastic before fastening the screws again. This will help soften the plastic and make it easier to fasten the screws tightly.

## Conclusion

Replacing the top shell on your 3Dr Iris Plus Quadcopter is an easy and affordable solution that can get your drone back in action in no time. With just a few simple steps, you can avoid the need for expensive repairs or even replacement, and keep your drone flying high.
