You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed My Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Battery and Screen – It's a Total Shocker!

Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you about the most surprising experience I've had with my Microsoft Surface Pro 3. I've always been a huge fan of this device, but after a few years of using it daily, the battery life had become quite poor, and the screen had a few scratches that were starting to affect visibility. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and replace the battery and the screen myself. And let me tell you, what happened next was a total shocker!

First of all, let me give you some context. I'm not an expert in electronics, and I've never done anything like this before. However, I've seen a few tutorial videos online, and I felt confident enough to try it out. I ordered a new battery and screen online, and a few days later, they arrived.

The process of replacing the battery was relatively easy, and I thought things were looking good. I followed the instructions carefully, and after a few minutes, I had successfully replaced the old battery with the new one. The device turned on, and everything seemed to be working correctly. However, when I tried to charge the device, it just wouldn't charge. I tried several charging cables and adapters, but nothing worked. I was starting to panic.

After doing some research online, I realized that the problem was with the battery I had purchased. It was a cheap knockoff, and it wasn't compatible with my device. I was so frustrated and disappointed. I thought I had ruined my beloved Surface Pro 3.

But here's where things get really interesting. While I was trying to fix the battery issue, I noticed that the screen had some flexing issues. I realized that I hadn't properly secured it, and it was causing some problems. So, I decided to open up the device again and fix the screen while I was at it.

Guess what? When I opened up the device, I found out that the original battery was still in decent shape! It wasn't great, but it was better than the one I had purchased. So, I carefully removed the new battery and put the old one back in. And guess what? It started charging properly!

That's when I realized that the entire battery replacement process was unnecessary! All I had to do was replace the screen, which I did successfully. And now, my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is running smoother than ever before.

So, what's the moral of this story? Well, first of all, always do your research before purchasing a replacement part. Make sure it's a high-quality product that's compatible with your device. And secondly, don't be afraid to try things on your own. There's a lot of satisfaction that comes from fixing things yourself, and you never know, you might just save yourself some time and money in the process.

In conclusion, my experience replacing my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 battery and screen was a rollercoaster of emotions. It was frustrating at times, but ultimately, it was a great learning experience. And now, my device is running better than ever before. So, if you're in a similar situation, don't be afraid to take the plunge and try fixing things on your own. You never know what surprises might be in store for you!

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced both the screen and battery in my surface pro 3 i7 256gb tablet. Yes both bridge connectors (Shims) are in place. I even tried swapping the bridge connector from the keyboard ribbon connect to the battery connect in Hope's it was just a bad bridge connector. I've tried factory resetting, uninstalling battery hard drives, hard reboots, visually inspected diodes and conduits running along mother board. Nothing seems to be fried or out. I have swapped different batteries .
I am able to turn the computer on only with the charger being plugged in (OEM CHARGER). It states it is “plugged in, not charging". But as soon as I unplug the power supply it immediately powers off.  Does not hibernate or go into sleep mood. Completely dies.
Is something possibly fried?
Are both batterys I'm using really defective? ( 1 battery states it's at 85% or 100% depending how you lay the bridge connector on. Other battery states 0%)
Do I have a defective LCD/DIGITIZER?
Is charging port messed up?
**BEFORE THE SCREEN AND BATTERY REPLACMENT IT WAS WORKING FLAWLESSLY.  MINUS THE NO TOUCHSCREEN

TO ADD THE FIRST INITIAL REPLACEMENT THE UNIT DID RUN WITHOUT BEING CONNECTED TO THE CHARGER. I HOWEVER NOTICED THE UNIT WAS DRAINING BATTERY FAIRLY QUICKLY. IT WAS ON APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES BEFORE IT DIED. THE BATTERY INDICATOR READ 63% BEFORE SHUTTING DOWN.

 No, the batteries aren’t defective.  There is a tiny shim/bridge that goes between the MB and the battery connector that often gets lost when replacing the battery.  Without it, the battery doesn’t work.  See the image here https://www.ebay.com/itm/Microsoft-Surfa...
