# You Won't Believe What Apple Did to Your iPhone 5C - Lightning to 3.5mm Cable Accessory ALERT!

Apple revolutionized the mobile industry when it first introduced the iPhone in 2007. Since then, every new iteration and feature of the device has been scrutinized and praised by the technology community. However, Apple has recently made a decision that might leave some iPhone 5C users scratching their heads.

Apple has decided to discontinue the production of the Lightning to 3.5mm Cable Accessory. This accessory was created to allow iPhone 5C users to connect their phones to traditional headphones with a 3.5mm jack. The accessory was introduced in 2013 when Apple transitioned from the ubiquitous 30-pin dock connector to the newer, smaller lightning connector.

The Lightning to 3.5mm Cable Accessory was a game-changer for many iPhone 5C users who relied heavily on their traditional headphones. It allowed them to continue using their preferred headphones even after the introduction of the lightning connector. Many users saw the accessory as a helpful compromise between the convenience of the new connector and the familiarity of the old technology.

The decision to discontinue this accessory has caught many iPhone 5C users by surprise. The news has caused backlash within the technology community, with many users feeling frustrated with Apple's decision. The accessory is now unavailable on Apple's website and other official stores, leaving users with limited options for connecting their iPhone 5C to traditional headphones.

The situation has been made worse by the fact that many third-party accessories claiming to be compatible with the iPhone 5C's lightning connector do not function correctly. This has led to many users purchasing faulty accessories, which in turn has caused damage to their devices.

Apple has not given any reason for discontinuing the Lightning to 3.5mm Cable Accessory. However, speculations suggest that it could be a move by Apple to encourage more users to transition to wireless headphones. Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack altogether in the iPhone 7 suggests that the company is actively pushing for the transition to wireless technology.

In conclusion, the discontinuation of the Lightning to 3.5mm Cable Accessory has left many iPhone 5C users in a difficult position. The accessory was a vital compromise that allowed users to continue using their traditional headphones while transitioning to the lightning connector. However, with the accessory no longer available, users are left with limited options, which could result in the need to upgrade to new technology, such as wireless headphones. Only time will tell if this move by Apple will be widely accepted, or if it will lead to a disgruntled user base.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello everyone,
So yesterday, when i connected my headphones to my iphone 5c via the standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, but the output sound was like someone singing underwater. So today, i went and purchased a Lightning to 3.5 mm adapter and the audio plays fine for some time, then it abruptly stops and a popup shows up saying “this accessory is not supported“.  What should i do?

 Does the cable plug go fully into the socket or is there a noticeable gap between the phone and the plug?
If there is a noticeable gap the charging socket needs to be cleaned with fine tweezers, or if needed a toothpick / sim pin eject tool. Be careful of the pins at the bottom of the charging port as they can be damaged if pushed against when cleaning the port.
For the headphone jack problem. The port either needs to be replaced or the housing replaced (if it is bent right at the headphone jack. It could also be the same problem of dust build up in the headphone jack port.

 This accessory is not supported have the bad contact of  cable to connector.There is possible resion.
1-Clean the connector might be dirty.
2-Change the charging flex.
3-Charging cable itself might be problem.
4-Trister might be also problem,This need microsoldering skills.

 These answers are bullshit!
it’s a software issue! and the culprit is Apple Company itself! Just buy an Apple certified adapter and it will work perfectly! In short: ( the headphone adapter you used isn’t genuine!)

 No. These solutions don’t work. Apple is breaking the trust of the customers by enforcing these rules through software. If the contact is dirty or loose then how does the music play for one minute and gets cut exactly at one minute timeframe every time. Is the dirt or loose connection so smart to take effect every one minute
