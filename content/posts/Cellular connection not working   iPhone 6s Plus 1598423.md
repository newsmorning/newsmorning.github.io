Title: You Won't Believe Why Your iPhone 6S Plus Cellular Connection is Failing!

Introduction:

If you own an iPhone 6S Plus, you may have noticed that your cellular connection has been playing up lately. Drops in network coverage can be infuriating, especially if you rely on your phone for work, entertainment, or socializing. 

However, before you go to your service provider or Apple store, there may be a surprising reason for your phone's flaky connectivity. In this article, we'll delve into the cause of iPhone 6S Plus cellular issues, how to diagnose the problem, and what you can do to fix it.

What is the iPhone 6S Plus cellular issue?

The iPhone 6S Plus is an older model released in 2015, which means it's less likely to be suffering from the latest hardware or software issues. However, some users report intermittent network coverage that comes and goes without any apparent cause. The problem can happen regardless of your location, carrier, or signal strength.

One possible explanation is the iPhone's battery life. Over time, the battery can degrade and lose its efficiency, leading to unexpected shutdowns or slower performance. When the phone's energy level drops below a certain threshold, the cellular module can be affected, which causes the signal drops or outright failure. 

How to diagnose the iPhone 6S Plus cellular issue?

To determine if your iPhone 6S Plus is experiencing a cellular problem related to the battery, you can follow these steps:

1. Monitor your battery life in the Settings app > Battery > Battery Health. If it shows that your Maximum Capacity is significantly lower than 100%, it means your battery's performance is degraded.

2. Check if your phone shuts down or restarts unexpectedly when accessing data-heavy apps, such as streaming video or music, using GPS navigation, or downloading large files.

3. Test your cellular connection in different locations and time of the day. Record your signal strength, download/upload speeds, and latency using apps like Fast.com, Speedtest by Ookla, or OpenSignal.

If you notice that your phone's battery drains quickly, or the cellular connection drops when the battery is low, there's a high chance that the two issues are related.

What can you do to fix the iPhone 6S Plus cellular issue?

Fortunately, there are some ways to mitigate the iPhone 6S Plus cellular problem caused by the battery:

1. Replace your battery - You can take your iPhone 6S Plus to an authorized service provider or a trusted repair shop to get a new battery installed. It costs around $50-$70, depending on your location and warranty status.

2. Enable Low Power Mode - This feature, available in the Settings app > Battery, optimizes your phone's power consumption by limiting background activities, visual effects, and network connectivity. While it may affect your phone's functionality, it can help extend your battery life.

3. Reduce network usage - If you notice that your phone's cellular connection drops when it's processing heavy data, try to avoid using those apps or activities that drain your battery quickly. You can also enable Wi-Fi calling or use a Wi-Fi network when possible.

Conclusion:

If you're experiencing a flaky cellular connection on your iPhone 6S Plus, don't panic. While it can be frustrating, there's a good chance that it's related to your phone's battery health. By monitoring your battery usage, testing your network coverage, and following the fixes, you can restore your phone's performance and connectivity. If the problem persists, you may need to seek professional help from your carrier or Apple support. But in most cases, it's a simple matter of managing your phone's energy consumption and usage patterns.

## Chosen Solution
 AT&T locked had them unlock put in new provider SIM card got only wi if calling and no service did all the resets and it keeps asking to update carrier settings push yes still nothing went away from house where wi fi is and tried all resets now no wi fi calling or cellular help!

 hello Joe,
start by checking the radio subsystem: press *#06# on the keypad. Write down what appears on the screen. Then go to settings - >> general - >> this device scroll down. Find the position of the firmware modem and imei. It will be important what these numbers look like. This way you will confirm whether the radio system works in the phone or it has been previously damaged (what happens sometimes). y speaking, when the phone asks you to update the operator's data, there is a suspicion that the communication system is damaged. In 6s, the repair is rather standard and quick. It shouldn't be expensive anymore (it's 2016 phone).
