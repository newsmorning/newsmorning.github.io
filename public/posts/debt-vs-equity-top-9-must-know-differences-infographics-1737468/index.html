But with so many options out there, it can be challenging to know where to start. Two of the most common funding models are debt and equity financing. While they both offer advantages and disadvantages, it’s essential to understand the differences between the two to make an informed decision. To help you make the right choice for your business, we created this article with mind-blowing infographics that reveal the nine differences between debt and equity.\nDefinition Debt financing refers to borrowed money that you must pay back over time with interest, while equity financing involves selling ownership shares of your business in exchange for funding. Debt financing can be a loan from a bank, while equity financing can come from individual investors.\nOwnership In debt financing, the business owner maintains ownership of the company. In equity financing, ownership shares are sold to investors, diluting the owner’s percentage of ownership.\nRisk With debt financing, the risk is borne by the borrower since the loan must be repaid with interest. With equity financing, the risk is shared among the investors since they own a percentage of the business.\nApproval Lenders are more likely to approve a debt financing application if the business has a good credit history or collateral. Equity financing may not have these requirements, but investors will expect a business plan and a strong growth potential.\nCost Debt financing generally has lower cost compared to equity financing, as loans usually have lower interest rates. In contrast, equity financing can be more expensive since investors require a higher rate of return on their investment.\nRepayment Debt financing must be repaid typically within a certain timeline or monthly installments. Failure to repay the loan can lead to legal action. Equity financing does not have fixed repayment terms, as it is invested capital.\nControl In debt financing, the borrower does not lose any control over business operations, while in equity financing, investors may have a say in decision-making since they own a portion of the company.\nTax Treatment Interest payments on debt financing are tax-deductible expenses. In contrast, equity financing is not tax-deductible, but dividends are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.\nScale Debt financing has a limit to the amount that can be borrowed, while equity financing can provide larger amounts of funding with no set limits.\nConclusion\nUnderstanding the differences between debt and equity financing is essential to find the right funding model for your business. The infographics reveal that both financing options have advantages and disadvantages. For example, debt financing can offer lower costs and more control over operations, but equity financing can provide larger amounts of funding and shared risk. Ultimately, the choice depends on your business’s specific needs and goals. We hope that our article will help you make an informed decision and succeed in your business ventures.\nDifferences Between Debt and Equity Debt and equity are the external sources of finance for a businessExternal Sources Of Finance For A BusinessAn external source of finance is the one where the finance comes from outside the organization and is generally bifurcated into different categories where first is long-term, being shares, debentures, grants, bank loans; second is short term, being leasing, hire purchase; and the short-term, including bank overdraft, debt factoring.read more. When a company needs a lot of money to expand projects or reinvestment and improve their products, services, or deliverables, they go for equity and debt.\nEquity is helpful for those who would like to go public and sell the company’s shares to individuals. To conduct an IPO, a company needs to bear various costs; but the result is most cases are helpful.In the case of debt, the story is slightly different. Businesses opt for debt for two main reasons. Firstly, if the company has gone through the route of equity, then they would take a portion of the debt to create leverage. Secondly, many businesses don’t want to go through the complicated process of IPO, so they opt for a route to take debt from the banks or financial institutions.
