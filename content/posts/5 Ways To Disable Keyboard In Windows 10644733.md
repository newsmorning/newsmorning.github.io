Say Goodbye to Keyboard Woes: 5 Genius Hacks to Disable Keyboard in Windows 10!

If you are someone who constantly faces issues with the keyboard on your Windows 10 computer, you are not alone. Be it a sticky key, a malfunctioning key or a broken keyboard, it can be a nuisance and hinder your productivity. However, disabling the keyboard is not always an easy task. Fortunately, we have compiled a list of 5 genius hacks to help you disable the keyboard in Windows 10.

1. Disable Keyboard Using Device Manager

The Device Manager is a powerful tool that lets you manage and control all the hardware devices on your computer. To disable your keyboard using Device Manager, follow these steps:

- Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.
- Type "devmgmt.msc" in the box and press Enter. This will open the Device Manager.
- In the Device Manager, expand the "Keyboards" category.
- Right-click on the keyboard device and select "Disable device".
- Click "Yes" to confirm.

2. Use a Third-Party Software

If you do not want to use the Device Manager or do not have administrator privileges, you can use a third-party software to disable your keyboard. There are many such software available in the market, such as "External Keyboard Helper" and "Kid Key Lock". These software offer various customizations and options to suit your needs.

3. Remove the Keyboard Driver

Windows 10 automatically installs the keyboard driver when you connect or reconnect your keyboard. Removing the driver will prevent Windows from recognizing your keyboard. Here’s how to remove the keyboard driver:

- Open the Device Manager by pressing the Windows key + R and typing "devmgmt.msc".
- Expand the "Keyboards" category and select your keyboard.
- Right-click on your keyboard and select "Uninstall device".
- Check the "Delete the driver software for this device" option and click "Uninstall".
- Restart your computer to complete the process.

4. Use a Script

If you are comfortable with writing code, you can use a script to disable your keyboard. To do this, follow these steps:

- Open Notepad or any text editor.
- Type the following code:

set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1
devmgmt.msc

- Save the file with the extension ".bat" (e.g. disablekeyboard.bat) and close Notepad.
- Double-click on the file to run the script.

5. Physically Disconnect the Keyboard

This may seem obvious, but physically disconnecting the keyboard is a foolproof way to disable it. If you are using a desktop computer, simply unplug the keyboard from the USB port. If you are using a laptop, you can remove the keyboard by unscrewing the bottom panel and disconnecting the keyboard cable.

Conclusion

These 5 genius hacks to disable the keyboard in Windows 10 will surely come in handy when you need them the most. Whether it is a faulty keyboard, a prankster colleague or a child who loves to type on the keyboard, these hacks will save you from frustration and allow you to continue your work uninterrupted.

Why would anyone want to disable the keyboard on a Windows PC? Well, if you watch videos on your PC with your toddler, the chances are that you want to temporarily block or disable the keyboard to stop the toddler from pausing or forwarding the video by hitting the keyboard.
 
Like its predecessors, Windows 10 also doesn’t offer an easy way to disable the keyboard, but disabling the keyboard in Windows 10 is not a tough job either.

The following are the five easy methods to turn off the keyboard on a Windows 10 PC.
 
Method 1 of 5
 
## Use Device Manager to disable keyboard
 
This method is not for the built-in keyboard, meaning you might not be able to disable your PC’s built-in or laptop keyboard.
 
Step 1: Right-click on the Start button on the taskbar to see the power user menu. Click Device Manager to launch the same.
 
Note that you can also launch Device Manager by typing its name in Start/taskbar search and then press the Enter key.
 
Step 2: Once Device Manager is launched, expand Keyboards to see connected keyboards.
 
Step 3: Right-click on the keyboard entry and click the Uninstall device option. If you have connected multiple keyboards, you need to disable one by one.

## Block keyboard using CrazyLittleFingers
 
CrazyLittleFingers is another excellent piece of software out there to help you block the keyboard on your PC. The best thing about this software is it’s portable, which means nothing, but you don’t need to install the software to run it.
