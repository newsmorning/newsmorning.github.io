# You won't believe the incredible news for India and Japan - Microsoft is bringing Cortana to Windows 10 this summer!

Microsoft has announced a massive upgrade to its popular Windows 10 operating system, much to the delight of users across India and Japan. From this summer, Microsoft will introduce its powerful virtual assistant, Cortana, for the Windows 10 operating system.

Cortana, which is named after the AI character in the popular Halo video game series, has been available since 2014 and was initially exclusive to the United States. However, in recent years, Microsoft has significantly expanded the AI's reach, and it is now available globally in various countries such as Canada, Australia, China, Brazil, and the United Kingdom.

With its arrival in India and Japan, the tech giant is broadening its horizons even further. The company announced that it has tailored the Cortana experience specifically to meet the language, culture and customs of both countries. This means users will enjoy a personalized assistant that will help them navigate their way through everyday life more efficiently.

The introduction of Cortana is part of ongoing efforts to make Windows 10 more user-friendly and to offer tools for handling complex tasks efficiently. Cortana acts as a personal digital assistant that can answer questions, set reminders, check your schedule, suggest apps and provide a wide range of other services. With the power of machine learning, Cortana gets smarter as she gets to know you over time. This means she will continue to boost her understanding of your personal preferences and routines, making her recommendations and suggestions even more accurate.

Cortana is a significant step forward for the Windows 10 platform, and the addition of India and Japan is excellent news for users in those countries. The AI is the latest innovation from Microsoft and is expected to help the tech company gain more market share in the global AI landscape.

In conclusion, the announcement of Cortana's arrival in India and Japan is fantastic news for Windows 10 users in these countries. Microsoft has shown that it is committed to enhancing its products, and the addition of Cortana is proof of that. With this upgrade, users can expect even more power and efficiency from Windows 10, making the platform an even more attractive option for current and potential customers.

We’ve previously reported that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update will bring a new version of Cortana. Now, the Times of India reports that India will be one of the few countries selected by Microsoft to test it.
 
This is an excellent piece of news since many users are looking forward to testing the improved version of Microsoft’s digital personal assistant. The tech giant already offered users a taste of its Windows 10 Anniversary Update at Build 2016 when CEO Satya Nadella demonstrated the many improvements that will be brought to Cortana. Among them, the Cortana Intelligence Suite and the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs focused on processing natural communication. Together, these two features should enhance Cortana’s performance even more and make the user-machine interaction more fluid.

Microsoft will deliver the new Cortana version to all the countries where the assistant is already available: the US, the UK, China, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil. The novelty is that two new countries, India and Japan, have been selected for this roll out alongside China. India, China, and Japan are the most important countries to Microsoft according to Marcus Ash, Microsoft group program manager for Cortana — and the reason is pretty obvious. Given the population size of these two countries, the tech giant has a huge user pool that can thoroughly test its products.
 
This summer version of Cortana is in English but Microsoft is taking into consideration the possibility of adding more languages to the menu for the Indian release.
 
Microsoft has already rolled out a series of improvements for Cortana with its latest Windows 10 Build. Build 14316 brings:
 
- low battery Cortana notifications so that you know when your Windows Phone needs charging
 - the ability to locate and ring your phone with Cortana which is very helpful if your phone gets stolen
 - the ability to share maps and routes between devices so that you don’t have to search for the same route twice.
