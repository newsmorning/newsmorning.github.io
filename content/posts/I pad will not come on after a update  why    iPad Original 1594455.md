For many Apple enthusiasts, owning a brand new iPad is both a dream and an achievement. It is no surprise that Apple releases new updates regularly to improve the overall performance of their products. Recently, many users have reported issues with their iPad after updating to the latest version. In this article, we will discuss why the original iPad model is suddenly dying and what you can do about it.

Since the first iPad model launched in 2010, it has been a staple in Apple's lineup. The device boasts a large screen, a sleek design, and the latest technology, making it an instant hit among consumers. However, as with all technological advancements, newer models replaced the original and support for the earliest model eventually ceased. 

Apple's latest update, iOS 14.5, has caused significant problems for users of the original iPad model. The update is said to be too high in size for this device, causing it to slow down or even crash entirely. This means that this update is not suitable for the original iPad and should not be installed.

The primary reason for the issue is that the original iPad model has a limited amount of RAM, which means it cannot handle complex applications or updated software efficiently. In contrast, newer models have more RAM, making them able to handle any new features or changes. 

It is worth noting that Apple has been transparent about which devices support iOS 14.5. Unfortunately, those who own the original iPad may not have noticed this information, resulting in ruined devices.

For users who have already installed the update and are experiencing issues, there are a few things to consider. Firstly, try to remove applications or reduce the number of open apps that may be impacting performance. Secondly, try restoring your device and update the software to iOS 5, which remains compatible with the original iPad model. 

Apple has yet to release a patch to rectify these issues. However, they acknowledge the issue and have recommended that those impacted use previous software releases for the time being.

In conclusion, those who own the original iPad model must be careful when updating their device. Apple's latest update is incompatible with this model, causing significant performance issues for users. If you have been unlucky enough to update your device and experience issues, it is worth noting that there are a few potential solutions. Unfortunately, in the long run, upgrading to a newer model may be your only solution. 

Stay updated with Apple's official website for updates on this matter. Always check compatibility before upgrading, so you do not end up ruining your device. It is always essential to consider the longevity of your gadget before purchasing and upgrading.
