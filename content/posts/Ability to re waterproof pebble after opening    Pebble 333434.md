# Revive Your Water-Damaged Pebble Watch in Just One Simple Step!

If you own a Pebble watch, you understand how important it is to keep it in perfect condition. However, accidents happen, and sometimes water finds its way to the watch. This may seem like the end of the world, but have no fear! You can revive your water-damaged Pebble watch in just one simple step!

First things first, do not panic! The situation may seem dire, but there is a solution. Here is what you need to do:

Step 1: Take Your Pebble Watch Out of Water Immediately

If your Pebble watch falls into water, remove it immediately. Water-damaged electronics can cause irreparable damage to electronic parts, causing them to malfunction. Therefore, you need to act fast before the water interferes with your watch's electronic parts.

Step 2: Use Silica Gel Packets

Silica gel packets are essential for keeping moisture out of electronic devices. They come in small packets and can be found at local stores or online. You can save these small packets from other products, such as shoes or medication bottles. However, make sure to keep them in a safe place for later use.

Once you have the silica gel packets, put your water-damaged Pebble watch in an airtight container with enough silica gel packets to cover it entirely. Seal the container and let your Pebble watch sit in it for at least 48 hours. The silica gel packets will absorb any remaining moisture on your watch, reviving it free from water damage.

Step 3: Power Up Your Pebble Watch

After 48 hours, take your Pebble watch out of the container and wipe it down. Then, try powering it up to check if it works correctly or not. If the watch does not turn on, leave it for a few more hours in the silica gel packet container before trying again.

When your Pebble watch turns on, charge it for at least one hour before use. This will ensure that the battery is fully charged and that the watch's mechanisms have gotten enough time to recuperate from the water damage.

In Conclusion

Reviving your water-damaged Pebble watch can be done in just one simple step. Removing it from water is the first and most important step. Then, using silica gel packets to absorb moisture is essential. You have learned that all you need to do is to put your water-damaged Pebble watch in an airtight container with silica gel packets, leave it for 48 hours, power it up, and charge it for an hour before use. With these steps, you can bring your Pebble watch back to life and enjoy its features once again!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi there,
I noticed on your guide you say it's impossible to open the pebble without compromising its waterproofing. Would you say it'd be that much more difficult to re-waterproof the device?

 Pebble now uses screws and gaskets to close and seal the most recent Pebble Originals and all versions of Pebble Steel.  Hopefully iFixit will revisit their teardown and, well, fix it :-).  The latest hardware is much more repairable; here's a step by step  photo gallery of a Pebble DIY screen replacement: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=...

 Find the adhesive ring for the screen, reinstall it properly, the device will still be waterproof
But the device is not repairable because everything is pretty much ruined when opening it, just buy a new one.

 Ah right, that's a bugger. Can you elaborate on 'pretty much' ruined? Thanks a lot :)

 If you were able to get a replacement screen would you be able to put it back together to function normally?
