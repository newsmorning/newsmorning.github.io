## Chosen Solution
 Hey.
Mostly a windows machine expert here, so i need some help with MacBooks. We have a IT shop and occasionally have to find new screens (with cover) for customers MacBook systems.
Is there a list on the web, that shows what screens fit “X” models? I mean, many of the Macbook Airs screen look like each other, but im not certain what fits what.
Like this case we have now - MacBook Air A1398, needs a new screen assembly (is it called clamshell) ?
