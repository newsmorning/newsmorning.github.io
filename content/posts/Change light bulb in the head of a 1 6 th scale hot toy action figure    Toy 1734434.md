Title: The Astonishing Results of Changing the Light Bulb in a 1/6 Scale Hot Toy Action Figure Toy

Introduction
Attention all toy enthusiasts! Have you ever wondered what would happen if you changed the light bulb in your 1/6 scale Hot Toy action figure toy? Well, I have the answer for you! In this article, we'll take a closer look at the consequences that come with switching up the bulb in these collectible toys.

Body
First and foremost, it's essential to understand why Hot Toy action figures come with light-up features. Hot Toys are known for their attention to detail, and the light-up feature is one way they bring their figures to life. The added illumination highlights the intricate design and enhances their visual appeal, making them an absolute treat for collectors' eyes. However, what happens when the bulb burns out, or you decide to swap it out with a different one?

You might be thinking, "how complicated could it be to change a tiny light bulb?" Well, let me tell you, Hot Toy action figures are not ordinary toys. These figurines are fragile, and the parts are intricately placed for maximum aesthetic value, which makes them challenging to maneuver.

Swapping out the bulbs of Hot Toys requires special tools, nimble fingers, and a lot of patience. If you're not up for the challenge, I suggest that you bring your favorite Hot Toy figure to a professional so as not to damage it. But, if you're feeling confident, here's what you can expect once you've successfully changed the light bulb.

Firstly, the right-colored bulb is essential. Hot Toy action figures are known for their color accuracy, and you don't want to ruin that by using a different colored bulb. Therefore, always ensure you use the correct hue to ensure the perfect outcome.

After you've successfully placed the bulb in its rightful place and reassembled the toy, you'll be surprised at the fresh, new look of your Hot Toy figure. The lighting feature typically draws attention to the toy's intricate detailing, and a new bulb will enhance that even more. It's like seeing the toy for the first time all over again. A simple change can have a massive impact on how it looks in your collection.

Conclusion
In conclusion, changing the light bulb of your Hot Toy action figure toy is no small feat. However, the results of doing so are well worth the effort. The perfect bulb will highlight the toy's most intricate details and enhance its overall appearance. So, if you're brave enough to attempt it, go ahead, take the plunge, and witness the stunning transformation that will occur right before your very eyes.

 Hi @barry14
Well, I would suggest you to share more pictures.
Do you have a multimeter?
It depends.. .as it could be a LED module that is faulty,
broken cables, bad soldering, etc,
check if the LED section is getting voltages.
