# Revive Your Asus Transformer T100 Today: Upgrade Your Micro USB Charging Port or Replace the Entire PCB with This Ingenious Hack!

If you're an owner of the Asus Transformer T100, you might be facing some charging issues with your device, particularly with the micro USB charging port. The micro USB port is a delicate part of the device, which can become loose or damaged over time, making it difficult to charge the tablet.

But don't worry, in this article we will show you how to save your Asus Transformer T100 from the graveyard and bring it back to life with a clever hack. You can either upgrade the micro USB port or replace the entire PCB board with a new one.

## Upgrading the Micro USB Port

The first thing you need to do is evaluate the damage to your micro USB port. If it's just a loose connection, you can fix it by opening the device and resoldering the connection. However, if the port is badly damaged, you'll need to upgrade it.

To do this, you'll need to buy a replacement micro USB charging port that's compatible with the Asus Transformer T100. Once you have the replacement part, the following steps will guide you through the process:

1. Turn off the device and disconnect it from any power sources.
2. Remove the back panel of the device by using a pry tool.
3. Locate the micro USB charging port on the PCB board.
4. Carefully desolder the old port from the board by heating up the solder points and using a soldering pump to remove the excess solder.
5. Solder the new micro USB port onto the board, making sure all the connections are properly made.
6. Reassemble the device and test the charging port.

## Replacing the Entire PCB Board

If the above method didn't work or you'd prefer a simpler solution, you can replace the entire PCB board with a new one. This method is ideal when the device is completely dead or suffers from multiple internal issues.

To replace the PCB board, you'll need to:

1. Purchase a replacement PCB board that's compatible with the Asus Transformer T100.
2. Follow the first three steps in the above guide to remove the back panel and locate the PCB board.
3. Remove the battery connector, the microphone ribbon cable, and the speaker cable from the old board.
4. Unplug the LCD and touch screen cables.
5. Unscrew the PCB board and remove it from the device.
6. Install the new PCB board in the same way as the old one was removed.
7. Reconnect all the necessary cables and screws.
8. Reassemble the device and test it.

## Conclusion

Charging issues can be frustrating, as it makes your device unusable. But with these two options, you can give your Asus Transformer T100 a new life. You can either upgrade the micro USB port or replace the entire PCB board. Although the cabling can be tricky, it can be achieved by following the steps mentioned above. By doing this, you won't have to buy a new tablet, and you'll save yourself some money.


## Chosen Solution
 Following my previous question, i come with a more technical one.
As my micro usb seems to be broken (charge only when cable is oriented on a specific angle) i would like to resolve this problem.
Therefore,
1) Do you think it would be cheaper to change the usb charging port ? It is e a 5pins if i'm correct but i cannont find a website who sell the same connector. Any help ?
2) Or would it be better to save the trouble and change the whole PCB? Again, i cannot find any seller which provide such PCB for a ASUS T100TA-DK002H, therefore i should need your help with this.
I really do thank u in advance,
Jeremy

 Hi Jeremy,
I order to replace the PCB for the Micro USB charge port you would have to replace the entire motherboard since the Micro USB and HDMI ports are directly connected to it.  If you disassemble the T100 down to the motherboard though, you can look at the Micro USB port and determine if one of the 5 pins has broken the solder contact.  This is the most common reason for this port to only work if you hold the cable in a particular position.  If this is the case, it would be best to be extremely careful not to bridge the contacts and simply resolder the broken contact down.  You could replace the port if you would prefer, but that would require you to desolder the 5 contacts to remove the old one, and then solder on the new one.  If you plan to go that route, you can search on eBay for any Micro USB port that is meant to be mounted flat on the PCB.  This is what you would need - eBay:  Micro USB Charging Port Connector.  If you wish to replace the entire motherboard it can range between $50-$100 USD, depending on the CPU and storage, and it should come with the eMMC Storage drive, Memory, and CPU already soldered to the board (these components are not supposed to be removed), and this is a link to a 32GB version - eBay:  32GB ASUS T100 Motherboard.  Let me know if I can be of any more help.

 It's a USB micro B, and you can find them on ebay or any electronic supply site or store.

 How hard is it to change out the USB Port on the asus transformer book t100?

Here is the ebay link where you can get the port.  Obviously, you need to be very careful taking this thing apart.  But it is possible to replace only this port.  It looks like quite a challenge to change the whole motherboard.  There is a separate 5 or 6 pin connector for the battery that has very fragile solder joints.  So use very little force if you're going to inspect those.  I would recommend looking at them with a magnifyer rather than applying any amount of force.  Also, when you replace the charging port, there are holes in the board for the physical mounts, but not "through hole" contacts.  The contacts on the bottom of the port just sit on top of pads, so you need to make sure you have good contact with them.  I suppose it's possible to solder them with the right equipment, but I could not.  I hope this helps.

 Had a similar situation myself. I opted to replace the port, & exact replicas are 5 for a couple $ on ebay. Since I don’t have a micro-soldering station (& I use the port only for charging), I broke off the pins used for data on the backside, then very carefully resoldered the port and 2 power pins back in their original position. Then just to add a bit of strength to it I put the board back in its casing, & added some hot glue over it. That was probably a bit overkill, but it was only my 2nd attempt to work on a Transformer MB. Note*   Be extremely careful when attempting to remove the board from the casing. The flat orange cable (Main LCD connector?) has some very finicky little pins which will make all efforts to repair null & void if bent. All connections inside should removed with as little force as possible, & preferably done under some magnification.

 Hi I am in the same situation. It costs more to get it repaired than to get a second hand one. Is it possible to just glue it down so the connections are touching? I don’t have a micro USB soldering kit and i doubt my chances of fixing it with a classic solder.
