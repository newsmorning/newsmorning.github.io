# You Won't Believe What These Rocket League Cars Can Do! The Ultimate List Revealed!

Rocket League, the exciting vehicular soccer game, has been a favorite of players for years. With its fast-paced gameplay, beautiful graphics, and stunning cars, it's no wonder that Rocket League continues to captivate gamers worldwide. However, what really sets Rocket League apart from other games is not just its gameplay, but the amazing ability of cars to do things beyond our imaginations.

In this article, we will explore some of the most incredible things Rocket League cars can do. These superpowers are bound to leave you awestruck and make you want to jump into the game straight away!

**1. Fly like a bird**

One of the most amazing features of Rocket League cars is their ability to leap off the ground and soar through the air. This allows players to perform all sorts of incredible moves, such as mid-air flips, dodges, and aerial shots. From a delicate touch to a high-flying aerial, these cars can do it all.

**2. Teleportation**

Imagine being able to teleport in a game like Rocket League? With certain car models such as the 'Octane ZSR' and 'Dominus GT', one can quickly change their car's position on the field with a blink of an eye. It's a feature that truly sets Rocket League apart from other games.

**3. Super speed**

In Rocket League, some cars go a lot faster than others. For instance, the 'Octane' and 'Dominus' models are more than capable of zooming across the field at a frightening pace, leaving their opponents in the dust. This ability is incredibly useful, especially when trying to score a goal or retake possession of the ball.

**4. Freeze your opponents**

Another amazing feature of Rocket League cars is their ability to freeze opponents' cars, giving players an incredible advantage. Cars like 'Frostbite' and 'Snowstorm' have the power to freeze opponents mid-flight, causing them to fall down onto the ground in a heap. This feature is incredibly useful when trying to disrupt the opponent's momentum and gain possession of the ball.

**5. Control the ball with magnets**

In Rocket League, some cars have magnets that can attract or push the ball around the field with ease. Cars such as 'Marauder' and 'Esper' have this unique feature, allowing players to have complete control over the ball's movement.

**6. Explode when you hit the ball**

Yes, an explosion may sound dangerous, but in Rocket League, it can be quite useful. Cars such as 'Roadhog XL' and 'Scarab' explode upon colliding with the ball, sending it flying in a specific direction. The explosion can be detonated or allowed to detonate upon impact.

**7. Have an afterburner**

The afterburner feature allows cars to go even faster than their usual speed. The flames that come out of the car's tailpipe indicate the feature is active, and players can zoom across the field like a comet. Cars like 'Hotshot' and 'Takumi RX-T' have this feature, making them even more formidable on the field.

**Conclusion**

Rocket League is an incredible game, and the unique abilities of its cars make it an even more thrilling experience. From high-flying aerials to magnets, super speed to freezing opponents, the Rocket League cars can do it all. Next time you play the game, keep these in mind and see for yourself how they can help you defeat your opponents.

Car Bundles purchased from item shops are believed to be classified as Exotic.

For example, Batmobile Halloween Bundle which had Batmobile(2016), Batmobile(1989), and The Dark Knight’s Thumbler was available from October 14, 2021, to November 1, 2021, and was sold for 2000 credits. Although, Batmobile(2016) and Batmobile(1989) fall under Premium Category. Hence, to avoid confusion any cars purchased as Bundles from the item shop are not included in the Exotic Category. Hence, Kamodo is the only Exotic car found currently in the game.
