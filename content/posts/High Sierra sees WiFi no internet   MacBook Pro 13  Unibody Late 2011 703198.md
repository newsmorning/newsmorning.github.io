This problem can be frustrating, especially if you rely on your MacBook for work or school. However, there are ways to fix this issue and get your MacBook Pro back online.

## Understanding the Issue

Before we get into the solutions, let's talk about what's causing the problem. If your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Late 2011 is running High Sierra (10.13.x), the issue might be related to the Wi-Fi card. This model comes with a Broadcom BCM4331 Wi-Fi card, which is known for having driver issues on High Sierra. When the driver is outdated, corrupted or missing, the Wi-Fi connection can be affected, leading to network drops and slow speeds.

## The Solutions

Here are some steps you can take to fix the Wi-Fi connectivity issue on your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Late 2011:

### Solution 1: Restart Your Router and MacBook Pro

Sometimes the simplest solution can be the most effective. Try restarting your router and your MacBook Pro. This can help refresh the connection and clear any temporary glitches that might be affecting your Wi-Fi connection.

### Solution 2: Update Your MacBook Pro

Make sure your MacBook Pro is running the latest version of High Sierra. Click on the Apple menu, select "About this Mac" and then click on "Software Update." If there are any updates available, download and install them. This can include important security fixes and patches that might fix the Wi-Fi issue.

### Solution 3: Reset the Wi-Fi Settings

Resetting the Wi-Fi settings on your MacBook Pro can also help fix this issue. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the Apple logo in the menu bar and select "System Preferences."
2. Click on "Network."
3. From the list of services on the left, select Wi-Fi.
4. Click on "Advanced."
5. Click on "Wi-Fi" tab and then click on "Remove" to remove any existing Wi-Fi networks.
6. Click "OK" to confirm.
7. Restart your MacBook Pro.
8. Connect to your Wi-Fi network again.

### Solution 4: Delete the Wi-Fi Configuration Files

If resetting the Wi-Fi settings didn't work, you can try deleting the Wi-Fi configuration files. Follow these steps:

1. Go to Finder and select "Go" from the menu bar.
2. Click on "Go to Folder" and type in "/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/"
3. Look for the following files and move them to the trash: 

com.apple.airport.preferences.plist
com.apple.network.identification.plist
com.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist
NetworkInterfaces.plist
preferences.plist

4. Empty the trash and restart your MacBook Pro.
5. Connect to your Wi-Fi network again.

### Solution 5: Install a New Wi-Fi Card

If none of the solutions above work, you can consider replacing the Wi-Fi card in your MacBook Pro with a new one. Apple doesn't officially support this, but it is possible to upgrade the Wi-Fi card on a MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Late 2011. You can buy a new Wi-Fi card online and install it yourself, or take it to an Apple store or authorized repair center to have it installed for you.

## Conclusion

If your MacBook Pro 13 Unibody Late 2011 is experiencing Wi-Fi connectivity issues on High Sierra, the problem might be related to the Wi-Fi card. However, there are several solutions you can try to fix the issue, including restarting, updating, resetting the settings, deleting the configuration files, and installing a new Wi-Fi card.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi guys, this seems to be a problem for many, but I searched the forums and couldn't find an answer.
Rebuilding a 13” MacBook Pro (A1278) i5. 500 SSD is fine, 4GB of RAM, board is fine. Installed High Sierra, took forever because internet on WiFi was going in and out.
I looked around and saw that the hardware was fine, it was connected with IP oddly. But, the icon on the top bar would be checking for signal every 2 seconds or so.
I followed some stuff, I found, like creating a new location in net prefs, deleting the connection and adding it back. Removing the library profiles to force a rebuild, reset NVRAM. nothing helped.
The hardware is recognized, sees my modem/connection fine. I have narrowed it down to a software issue with High Sierra.  Ran diagnostics, said move closer to signal? I'm 10ft.  away.
I'm hoping for a patch, fresh idea, anything. One method just said turn off the desktop icon and bluetooth, no help. So, I'm stuck and this is always where I come. Thanks. I even tried manual setting up the WiFi using Google's free dns. 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, no go.

 From the sounds of it you have really a simple problem! The antenna leads to the antenna unit held in the black clutch cover have gotten damaged so you are not getting the full signal.
You’ll need to remove the display assembly to gain access to the part following this guide: MacBook Pro 13" Unibody Late 2011 Display Replacement then you can slide the clutch cover to the side and then off and here’s the needed part: 13” MacBook Pro Antenna (11/12) recycled
The area that is often damaged in at the hinge or the connectors on the AirPort board.
