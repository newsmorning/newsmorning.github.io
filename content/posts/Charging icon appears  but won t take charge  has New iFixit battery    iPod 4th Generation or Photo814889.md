If you are facing issues with charging your 4th generation iPod or photo after replacing its battery with a new one from iFixit, then there could be a surprising explanation for it. Although it's frustrating to get a brand new battery and find out that your device is still not charging, there is a workaround to fix this issue easily.

In this article, we explore the reasons why your iPod 4th Gen or Photo might not be charging, even with a new iFixit battery.

Firstly, it could be the charging port that's causing the issue. Over time, the charging port could have accumulated dust, debris, and lint, leading to a poor connection between the charger and the device. This can ultimately result in the device not charging, even if the battery is new.

To address this issue, clean the charging port using a soft-bristled brush or compressed air. You can also try using a Q-tip dipped in alcohol to gently clean the charging port.

Secondly, it's possible that the battery connector isn't securely in place. Even though the battery might be new, it might not be properly connected to the device, causing charging issues to arise.

To fix this issue, you can try removing the battery connector and giving it a gentle push in the opposite direction while inserting it back. This should firmly connect the battery, which should result in the device charging successfully.

Lastly, the charging cable might be the culprit. If you are using a cable that's not authorized, it could be less effective in charging your device, resulting in false battery readings.

To avoid this issue, try using a compatible charging cable for your 4th Gen iPod or Photo. This can ensure that your device charges quickly and effectively, even with a new iFixit battery. Additionally, you might also want to consider getting a reputed cable for charging your device.

In conclusion, your iPod 4th Gen or Photo might just need the charging port to be cleaned, the battery to be properly connected, or a reliable charging cable to begin charging again, even with a new iFixit battery. These quick fixes can ensure that your device is up and running, and you can go back to enjoying your music collection or images without any interruptions.

## Chosen Solution
 I had a dead iPod 4th gen 40 GB for years, so when I finally replaced the battery the other day with a new one from iFixit, I was very happy to see the device boot up and still show all the data I stored on it in 2007.  It powered up and the battery icon showed minimal power (what the new battery shipped with), and I could play songs and navigate the device. I did not wipe and restore with iTunes, though I did hard reset a couple times to make sure everything was OK.
But it won't take any new charge when I plug it in either to a Macbook USB port, or an AC USB wall block. On a Macbook USB port it does nothing at all, like it's not even plugged in. On the AC charger, the "Charging" icon flashes in the upper right of the screen as expected, and when asleep the big charging icon is on the screen, but no actual power is being stored by the battery. When I unplug it, the battery reads empty, and after a night plugged into the wall, while it said charging, the battery is now completely dead.
What gives? Is the battery from iFixit a bad part? Is there something else that would keep the battery from recieving/storing power even when the iPod thinks it is actually charging?

 what is battery voltage?
