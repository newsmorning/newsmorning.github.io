Silent Shock: LG TV Owners Stunned as No Sound Comes from TV Programmes - What's the Secret Behind This Make or Break Issue?

If you're an LG TV owner, you might have faced the issue of no sound coming from your TV while watching your favorite program. This is a frustrating problem that can ruin your TV watching experience. As a user, you might wonder what's causing this issue and how you can fix it.

The lack of sound from LG TVs has been widely reported by the users in various forums and discussion boards. There have been a lot of theories and explanations about this issue, but the real reason behind it is still unclear. However, there are a few things that you can do to troubleshoot the problem.

Firstly, you need to check the settings of your TV. It is possible that the sound has been muted or that the volume has been turned down unintentionally. This is a common mistake that many people make, and it is an easy fix.

Another issue that can cause sound problems is the connection between the TV and the device that you're using to play content. If you're using an HDMI cable to connect your device to the TV, make sure that it is securely plugged in. If the cable is loose, it can cause sound issues.

If the issue persists, you can try resetting your TV. This will reset all the settings and should fix any software-related issues that could be causing the sound problem. You can do this by going to the settings menu and selecting the option to reset your TV.

If none of the above solutions work for you, it is possible that you have a hardware issue with your TV. In this case, you should contact customer support and get your TV repaired or replaced.

Overall, the no-sound issue with LG TVs can be a frustrating problem. However, there are simple troubleshooting steps that you can take to try and fix the issue. Whether it is a simple setting change or a hardware issue, it's always best to check the problem before rushing to buy a new TV. You might just save yourself a lot of time and money in the process.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
I’ve got a LG OLED55B7V TV and a couple of days ago the sound died, but only when playing watching TV programmes. I’ve also got a LG soundbar and a PS4 and so was able to run a few tests.
When using the soundbar or the internal speakers I get sound when playing the PS4, and I’ve run a speaker check that also confirms that the internal speakers are ok. I’ve reset the AV (via pressing the mute button three times) but it’s done nothing.
So, I’m very confused - the TV itself is ok, but simply won’t play sound when watching TV channels. I have a satellite dish and it’s occurred to me that the sound may not be coming through that? Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Alex

 @sartois  since you’ve already checked other input sources and found those to be working, the issue is most likely with your Satellite receiver and not your TV. Try either a new cable (check the connections of course) or try to reset your satellite receiver.
