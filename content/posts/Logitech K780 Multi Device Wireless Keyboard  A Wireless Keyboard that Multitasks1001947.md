We purchased the Logitech K780 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

If you routinely use more than one device while you work, the Logitech K780 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard is amenable to switching as you need and want to. It sports a handy tray for stowing smaller devices like tablets and smartphones and offers instantaneous switching between them with a simple keystroke. Like many Logitech peripherals, this computer keyboard is compatible with the Logitech Unifying software for nano-USB connectivity. You’re also free to forego the unifying receiver and connect exclusively through Bluetooth. There’s plenty of flexibility to connect and work with your devices as you see fit, though the actual typing experience is a little less forgiving.

 
##   Design: Makes room for smart devices  
 

The Logitech K780 offers the prospect of portability at just slightly under 2 pounds. But at nearly 15 inches long, fitting it into a daily tote or backpack was cumbersome. It’s best to leave this in one place, though moving from room to room—from a home office to the couch for example—was easy given the lack of restrictive wires. The rubber cradle at the top of the device is the most distinguishing feature of this Logitech keyboard. It’s wide enough for most smartphones in both vertical and horizontal orientations and iPad Pros in landscape mode. 

 

While it’s not necessarily ultra-portable, that can be a good thing for everyday use. It’s large enough to include a handy number pad, several hotkeys for quick switches between devices, desktops, app-specific actions, and media controls. The other side of that coin, though, is that all keys are rounded, which took away the typical amount of key surface area I am used to. Even though I have small hands, I experienced a fair share of slipping off keys or inaccurate keystrokes. Larger-handed users will likely find both the size and shape of the keyboard to be less than accommodating.

##   Performance: Quiet and mostly responsive  
 

The Logitech K780 falls into the membrane-style keyboard category, meaning that the keys aren’t operated by a mechanical switch as on mechanical keyboards. The keys are slightly raised and feature a concave design and the proprietary Logitech PerfectKeyStroke system, which is supposed to evenly distribute force across the key for smoother and quieter feedback. That means that even if you hit the key at the edge, your input will be recognized without a hitch. 

 

In use, the experience was similar to a laptop keyboard but with a little more give and nearly silent keystrokes. I noticed the occasional delay, especially with rapid typing, but they were few and far between. I also appreciated not having to worry about when the battery would need to be recharged. The K780 comes with two AAA batteries that are supposed to power the keyboard for 2 years, so battery life is a strength. There’s an auto-sleep function to help extend battery longevity.  

 
##   Comfort: Cramped and awkward  
 

Logitech categorizes the K780 as a full-size keyboard, but with continued use, it felt small and constricted. I have quite small hands and yet my fingertips felt like they were always kind of sliding off the keys. The PerfectKeyStroke technology helped correct errors associated with key slipping, but the overall experience wasn’t comfortable. Between the small size and the round shape of the keys, the overall flat design without wrist support, and what felt like a very minimal distance between keys, my hands felt quite cramped after a couple hours of use. This doesn’t bode well for a person that has to do a lot of typing and has larger hands.

##   Wireless: Instant switching between devices   
 

One area where I encountered no issues was wireless performance. The K780 has the potential of operating up to 33 feet from the signal source. While I didn’t experience this maximum range, I saw no range issues up to nearly 20 feet away over Bluetooth and nearly 15 feet away via the provided Logitech Unifying USB receiver. The three input hotkeys delivered instantaneous switching between devices and pairing was equally speedy and easy. 

 
##   Software: Customization ease with Logitech Options  
 

The Logitech K780 is very easy to set up with Logitech Options and the Logitech Unifying Receiver software. It’s a useful tool for keeping track of connected devices and how they’re connected as well as customize the handful of keys that can be catered to your workflow. As a macOS and iOS user, I appreciated the handy Mac hotkeys, but these can be changed to do everything from launching the calculator to assigning a modifier key. The function key also supports several other shortcuts based on the operating system. 

 

Bluetooth connectivity automatically recognizes the operating system and configures the keyboard accordingly. But via wireless, there are shortcuts to set up the keyboard based on whether you’re operating Windows, macOS, or iOS. There might not be a great need to actually customize this keyboard, but at any rate, the software offers a convenient way to keep track of connected devices and make sure your device firmware is up to date. This software will also email you when the keyboard’s batteries are running low.

 
##   Price: Not quite a splurge or a bargain  
 

The Logitech K780 retails for about $80, which puts it in the sort of rare middle tier of wireless keyboards that cost more than budget-minded models but less than the premium options. Like its more expensive Logitech counterparts, it offers wireless connectivity to multiple devices across operating systems, plus the added value of clearing desk clutter, thanks to the device tray for a tablet or smartphone. 

 

This form factor gives it an edge over inexpensive or pricier $100-and-above keyboards like the Apple Magic Keyboard or Microsoft Bluetooth Keyboard, which aren’t system-agnostic. But while it’s friendly to other smart devices, you won’t get ergonomics or the added flexibility of USB-C charging/wired use when the battery is low.

 
##   Logitech K780 vs. Satechi Bluetooth Wireless Smart Keyboard  
 

It’s also slightly slimmer at 0.7 inches but it’s nearly 1 pound lighter. While it’s slightly longer than the K780, its completely flat build makes it slightly more portable. It’s also battery-operated, but the battery life is about three weeks shy of the K780. The Satechi’s keys are also the traditional square flat shape and size, which will offer more familiar comfort to most.
