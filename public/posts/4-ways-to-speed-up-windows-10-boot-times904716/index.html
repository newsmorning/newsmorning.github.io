The startup process can be downright annoying and time-consuming, especially when you are in a rush. Fortunately, there are a few simple tips that can help you speed up your Windows 10 startup time and get your computer up and running in mere seconds.\nIn this article, we will reveal four game-changing tips to help you make your boot time up to 10x faster. So, without further ado, let’s dive right in!\nTip #1: Clean up Your Disk\nThe first tip to speed up your boot is to clean up your disk. Over time, we tend to accumulate a lot of files, documents, and programs, many of which we no longer use. These files can take up valuable storage space on your hard drive, which can slow down your computer’s performance and boot time.\nTo clean up your disk, go to the Start menu, type in “Disk Cleanup,” and select the option. This tool will scan your computer for unnecessary files and temporary files that can be deleted safely. By doing this, you can free up some space on your hard drive and speed up your computer’s performance.\nTip #2: Disable Startup Programs\nAnother reason why your computer is taking forever to boot is because of the number of programs that launch during startup. Some programs automatically launch when you start your computer, and this can increase the time it takes for your computer to start up.\nTo disable unnecessary startup programs, right-click on the taskbar and select “Task Manager.” Select the “Startup” tab to see a list of programs that launch during startup. Right-click on each program you want to disable and select “Disable.” This will prevent the programs from launching during startup and speed up your startup time.\nTip #3: Optimize Your System Configuration\nWindows 10 comes with several built-in tools that can help you optimize your system configuration, which can also help speed up your boot time. The first is the built-in System Configuration tool, which allows you to disable unnecessary services and startup programs.\nTo access the System Configuration tool, go to the Start menu and type in “msconfig.” Select the “Services” tab and uncheck any services that you do not need. Next, select the “Startup” tab and disable unnecessary programs. Finally, select “Apply” and restart your computer.\nTip #4: Upgrade to an SSD\nThe final tip to speed up your boot time is to upgrade to an SSD. A solid-state drive (SSD) is a type of storage device that uses flash memory to store data. Unlike traditional spinning hard drives, SSDs have no moving parts, which makes them much faster and more reliable.\nUpgrading to an SSD can significantly reduce your boot time, as well as improve the overall performance of your computer. SSDs are quite affordable these days and easy to install, making them an excellent investment for anyone looking to speed up their Windows 10 startup time.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, these are four game-changing tips that can help you speed up your Windows 10 startup time. By cleaning up your disk, disabling unnecessary programs and services, optimizing your system configuration, and upgrading to an SSD, you can reduce your boot time by up to 10x, making your computing experience more enjoyable and efficient. So, try out these tips and enjoy a faster, more responsive computer!\nWindows 10 is Microsoft’s fastest booting operating system ever. But could it be faster? The answer is yes, it could. You have a few options available to help Windows 10 boot even faster. These speed boosts don’t require any dangerous tweaks and can shave seconds from your boot time.\nSo, here are four ways to speed up Windows 10 boot times.\n1. Fast Startup Windows 10 includes a specific option to enable your system to boot fast, known as fast startup. Fast startup is an advanced power state that operates as a middle-ground between hibernation and shutdown.\nWhen you enable fast startup, Windows 10 creates a small hibernation file to reboot from. The hibernation file is smaller than usual as it does not record your active session (whereas if you hibernate normally, the hibernation file is larger and includes everything you were doing at the time), making it quicker to load.\nThe result is that when you hit the power button, the reduced hibernation file boots much quicker, reducing your Windows 10 boot time.\nHow To Enable Windows 10 Fast Startup If you want to enable Windows 10 fast startup, press Windows Key + I, type power in the search box, and select Power \u0026 sleep. Scroll down and select Additional power settings.\nWhen the Control Panel window opens, select Choose what the power buttons do, then Change settings that are currently unavailable. Check the Turn on fast start-up box to make sure it is enabled, then select Save Changes.\nIssues With Fast Startup If you enable fast startup and suddenly notice performance issues, or even Windows 10 booting slower than before (due to issues loading the hibernation file), switch fast startup off again.\n2. Remove Or Reduce Windows 10 Startup Items Next up, consider reducing the number of programs that run when you boot Windows 10. Startup programs increase the time it takes to launch Windows 10, as each program requires system resources to boot.\nMany programs set themselves to launch automatically at boot. At times, you’ll find an option to stop the program booting at startup within the program’s options, while others do not. There is also the option of using the Windows 10 Task Manager Start-up tab.\nRight-click the Taskbar and select Task Manager, then select the Start-up tab. Here you can see the list of installed programs that run each time you start your computer. Select a program that you wish to stop running when you turn your computer on, right-click, and select Disable.\nReducing the number of startup programs will speed up the Windows 10 boot time. However, you’ll want to keep certain programs, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, antivirus programs, and so on.\nRemove Startup Items From Windows 10 If you open the Task Manager and see a long list of programs, you should consider removing any unnecessary or old apps you no longer use.\nPress Windows Key + S, input Control Panel, and select the Best Match. Now, select Uninstall a program from the options, opening the Programs and Features list. Here you’ll see a list of each program installed on your computer.\nWork your way through the list of programs and uninstall any unused programs. Uninstalling unused and outdated programs can also help to reduce your Windows 10 boot time, as well as free up extra space on your hard drive.\n3. Check For Malware Another consideration is malware, which can drastically reduce your system boot time. Malware has a nasty habit of making things slow, among other issues. Furthermore, some malware types are extremely stubborn and refuse to leave your system.\nYou can scan your system with the Windows Security suite to find any malware, then remove it before restarting your system. Input windows security in your Start Menu search bar to open the Windows Security Center. Select Virus \u0026 threat protection from the menu, then run the Quick Scan.\nWhen the scan finishes, quarantine and remove any malware or potentially unwanted programs found.\nYou have another option, too: Check out our guide to removing malware with completely free tools.\n4. Install An SSD Installing a new solid-state drive (SSD) is a sure-fire way to speed up Windows 10 boot time. You can pick up a small SSD for a very low price. After installing Windows 10 on an SSD, you can expect your Windows 10 boot time to decrease by around 20 seconds in comparison to a regular hard drive.\nYour experience with a Windows 10 SSD installation will vary, of course, but the difference in boot time is dramatic. Furthermore, there are different types of SSD drives. If you’re unsure which to buy, check out our overview and comparison of SSD drive technologies.\nSpeed Up The Windows 10 Boot Time These four options are guaranteed to speed up your Windows 10 boot time. The reduction in time will vary from system to system. Start with the two easiest options—switching on fast startup and reducing your startup programs—before proceeding to the second two options.\nWhile installing a new SSD sounds difficult, you’ll find countless tutorials online detailing exactly what you need to do. For the installation time and investment, an SSD is one of the best options of all as it provides a boost across your entire operating system, not just your Windows 10 boot time.\nWhen you’re ready to upgrade to an SSD, make sure to read our solid-state drive buying guide before making your purchase.\n","wordCount":"1500","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"James Mitchell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/4-ways-to-speed-up-windows-10-boot-times904716/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>10x faster boot in seconds: 4 game-changing tips revealed to speed up Windows 10 startup time!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 8, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1500 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;James Mitchell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-fast-startup>1.
