# You won't BELIEVE what's causing these weird lines on your TV screen - and how to fix it!

The seemingly constant state of modern technology continues to bring new innovations to our daily lives. However, it also comes with its fair share of headaches – including strange lines appearing on your TV screen. These annoying lines can stem from a range of culprits, so figuring out the source can be a challenge. 

In this article, we'll look at what causes weird lines to appear on TV screens and the best way to troubleshoot these problems.

## What causes weird lines on TV screens?

The culprit behind the lines on your TV will depend on how the issue itself looks. If the lines are erratic and pixelated, it's likely a signal or reception issue. Suppose the lines are good and consistent, in that case, it could point to an equipment hardware problem, including a bad cable or even your TV.

In addition, it's equally possible that your TV internally has a fault – including loose internal wiring or malfunctioning capacitors.

## How to fix weird lines on TV screens?

Once you've established the culprit, it's time to get to work.

### Check your signal

The first port of call is a quick check around your home's signal connection. Is your antenna or satellite dish secure and receiving good strength? If so, try removing and plugging it back in – the problem may have occurred from a loose connection.

### Replace your cord

Next, it's useful to test a different cable. Sometimes, the solution is as easy as getting a new HDMI, RF, or coaxial cords. First, ensure that your TV has more than one input port, and then swap out the cables to check whether this helps to improve image quality.

### Factory reset your television

If none of the previous fixes worked, the problem may be inside the TV itself. Thus, it's worth performing a factory reset. It's a non-invasive process that will restore default TV settings and remove all saved settings and configurations. That's the easiest way to get your television back to working condition – similar to when it was new. However, it's worth noting that resetting your TV may delete all of its contents, so be sure to keep a backup before you hit the reset button.

### Call in an expert

Unfortunately, if your TV's still acting up, it's time to call in the specialists. A licensed television repair professional will have an extensive database of knowledge and expertise to diagnose the problem firsthand.

In conclusion, strange lines on your TV screen can drive you crazy, but understanding the problem and implementing the right solution can save you a trip to purchase a new television. So, do not panic; just follow the trouble-shooting steps outlined above, and in no time, you'll be back to enjoying your favorite TV programs.
