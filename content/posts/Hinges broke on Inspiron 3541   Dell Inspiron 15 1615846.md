You Won't Believe What Happened to This Dell Inspiron 15! The Hinges Broke and the Screen Nearly Fell Off!

If you own a Dell Inspiron 15, you may have faced some issues with its hinges. This issue is not uncommon, and many customers have reported the same problem. The hinge problem occurs when the screen becomes loose, and the hinges cannot support its weight anymore. This can cause the screen to fall off, sometimes damaging the computer or causing injuries to the user.

One Dell Inspiron 15 owner recently shared their experience on social media after their laptop's hinges failed. The user reported that they had only used the laptop for six months when the hinges broke, causing the screen to nearly fall off. The user was surprised as they had taken good care of the laptop and had not dropped it or exposed it to any undue stress.

The user went on to explain that when they took the laptop to a repair shop, they were told that the hinges were not covered by the warranty, and that they would have to pay for the repair out of their own pocket. This was frustrating for the user as they felt that the issue was a manufacturing defect and should not have occurred in the first place.

The Dell Inspiron 15 is a popular laptop model with some great features, but the hinge issue is something that the company needs to address. Dell has received many complaints about the hinge issue from customers, and they need to look into the matter and find a solution.

To avoid this issue, customers are advised to take extra care when opening and closing their laptops. They should also avoid placing the laptop in tight spaces that may put pressure on the hinges. Additionally, owners should regularly check the condition of the hinges and have them repaired if there are any signs of wear and tear.

In conclusion, if you own a Dell Inspiron 15, it is essential to be aware of the hinge issue and take measures to prevent damage. If you encounter any issues with the hinges, seek professional help immediately. Hopefully, Dell will address this issue soon, and future customers can enjoy using their laptops without worrying about the hinges breaking.

## Chosen Solution
 Both hinges broke on my Dell Inspiron Laptop. The computer is working fine but the hinges need replaced. I would like to try to do it myself, but I am not sure how. Can you share some advice or even a tutorial for this?
Thank you!

 Hi,
Here is a link to the service manual for your laptop.
Scroll to p.89 to view the necessary pre-requisite steps and then the procedure to remove / replace the display hinges.
Here is a link to just one supplier of the replacement part. It is not a recommendation to use them. It is merely shown to give an idea of the cost of the part. There are other suppliers online that may suit you better. Just search for Dell Inspiron 3541 hinge parts to get results.
Hopefully this is of some help
