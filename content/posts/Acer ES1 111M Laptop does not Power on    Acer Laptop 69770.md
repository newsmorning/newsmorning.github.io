## Chosen Solution
 Please help me fixing my , when i press the power botton,i just see the power light ant nothing else?

 Can you remove the battery, unplug the power supply then press and hold the power button for 10seconds. The power light should glow then fade out. Now re-install battery and try again.
If this is not successful, you will have to remove the RAM, Hard Disk and DVD Rom drive and with the battery in try again. If the machine boots, switch off then install each device one by one powering on each time until the laptop stops coming on. The last item re-connected will be the problem.
Hope this helps.
