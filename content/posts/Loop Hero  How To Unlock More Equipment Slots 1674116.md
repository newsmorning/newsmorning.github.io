Title: Unlock the Secret to Loop Hero's Best Gear - Learn How to Expand Your Equipment Slots Now!

Are you having trouble getting through the loops of Loop Hero because your equipment slots are always full? Worry no more because we have the solution for you. In this article, we will show you how to unlock the secret to Loop Hero's best gear by expanding your equipment slots.

Loop Hero is a highly addictive game that has taken the gaming industry by storm. The game's engaging mechanics and retro graphics have attracted many players worldwide. One of the game's unique features is the equipment system, where you can equip your hero with items that boost their stats.

However, the problem is that the game only allows you to equip three items at a time. This restriction makes it challenging to progress through the game, especially in higher loops. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem: expanding your equipment slots.

How to Expand Your Equipment Slots

The first step in expanding your equipment slots is to unlock the "Load Bearing" trait. This trait is available for purchase in the Village tab after you have built the Supply Depot. The Load Bearing trait costs 2,500 resources, so make sure you have enough before purchasing it.

Once you have unlocked the Load Bearing trait, your equipment slots will increase by one. You can then equip four items instead of three, increasing your hero's strength, defense, and other attributes.

The second way to expand your equipment slots is by finding and equipping the "Treasury" item. The Treasury item is one of the rarest items in the game that provides a massive boost to your camp's resources. You can find this item by defeating elite enemies or opening secret chests in the loop.

Moreover, the Treasury item also expands your equipment slots to five instead of four. This item is game-changing as it allows you to equip more items to your hero, making it easier to advance to higher loops.

Conclusion

Loop Hero is a game that has captured the hearts of many gamers worldwide due to its engaging gameplay and retro aesthetics. Equipment is a significant part of the game that boosts your hero's stats and makes it easier to progress through loops.

However, the game's limited equipment slots can make it difficult to equip all the essential items. That's why it's essential to know how to expand your equipment slots. By unlocking the Load Bearing trait and finding the Treasury item, you can equip more items to your hero, making it easier to progress through loops.

So, what are you waiting for? Unlock the Load Bearing trait and find the Treasury item to unlock the secret to Loop Hero's best gear. Happy looting!

To get more equipment slots in Loop Hero, you need to collect a golden card Arsenal by building Smelter at your base. This will give you one additional slot depending on the Hero class you are playing. For Warriors which will be an additional Helmet slot, an Amulet slot for Rogues, and Sheild Slot for Necromancers.
 
Loop hero has an intriguing inventory management system. Removing items from inventory in Loop Hero is an automated process just like the auto-playing of the game. This means all your old items will be automatically deleted and converted to scraps once you gather new resources. This is the same for the items you replace from inventory. As your inventory is limited at any given point, you will find them pushed out of your inventory as new items are added to you. So keeping this in mind, you need to check every new item you receive to always equip the best item with stats from the inventory. This process is very convenient as the inventory saves time for your future expansion the more you explore the world and play the same loop over and over again.
