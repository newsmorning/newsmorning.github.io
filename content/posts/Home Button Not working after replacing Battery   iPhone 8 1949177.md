If you own an iPhone 8 and you're due for a battery replacement, you might want to think twice before taking it to just any repair shop. According to recent reports, replacing your iPhone 8 battery could potentially lead to your home button breaking. Here's what you need to know before getting your battery changed.

The issue stems from the way the iPhone 8 is designed. Apple made it so that only authorized repair centers could replace the batteries on this model. But some third-party repair shops have found a way to replace the battery without going through Apple. Unfortunately, in some cases, the process can render the home button useless.

This happens because of the way the home button is connected to the device's logic board. When a non-authorized technician opens up the phone to replace the battery, they can often damage the home button's connection. This can result in the button not working at all or only working intermittently.

If you're considering a third-party battery replacement, it's important to understand the risks involved. Replacing an iPhone 8 battery without proper training and equipment could end up causing more harm than good. In many cases, it's best to go directly to Apple or an authorized service provider for this type of repair.

Another option is to simply replace the device altogether, though this can be costly. If the home button is broken, it could also affect your ability to use features like Touch ID or Apple Pay. This can create significant inconvenience for iPhone 8 users.

So, what should you do if you're in need of a battery replacement for your iPhone 8? First, make sure you're going through a trusted and authorized repair center. You can find a list of authorized providers on Apple's website. Second, be aware of the risks involved in DIY or non-authorized repairs. Finally, consider upgrading to a newer device if the cost of repair is too high.

Replacing the battery on an iPhone 8 can be a tricky process, especially if you're not familiar with the device's design. But by taking the right steps and working with a reputable repair shop, you can ensure that your iPhone 8 remains in good working order for years to come. Just don't take any shortcuts or risks when it comes to getting your battery replaced.

## Chosen Solution
 I just replaced the battery on my iphone  8, No problems with that repair. But the home button no longer works, Touch ID and haptics work, but home button is dead.
The Button/touch ID assembly  at the bottom of the phone is in perfect shape, no cuts, breaks bent parts, I never even touched that part but I checked anyways after.  I even messed with the tension on the screws to see if that was the problem
The only thing that looks like a possibly is a extremely small tear on the the digitizer cable right before it connects to the logic board, although the tear is less than a mm into the cable and it doesn’t even look like it reached the traces.
This seems strange as disconnecting the display was the second step in all of this and I didn’t mess with anything  in that area of the phone

 If you see a tear, it is a tear.
It is super easy to tear this cable. In the factory or repair service center, there is probably a fixture holding the screen up while assembling to remove any possibility of tearing it.
In DIY scenario, the cable is often torn because the user just laid the screen flat.
