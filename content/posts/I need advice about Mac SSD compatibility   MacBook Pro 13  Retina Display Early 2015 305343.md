Is Your MacBook Pro SSD Compatible? Discover Expert Advice for Early 2015 Retina Display Now!

If you own an Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display, you may have noticed that your computer's performance has begun to decline over time. Perhaps your MacBook Pro is running slower or taking longer to load applications, causing frustration and a decrease in productivity.

One solution to this problem is to upgrade the MacBook Pro's SSD, or solid-state drive. However, not all SSDs are compatible with the Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display. It can be a confusing process to navigate, but fear not - we've compiled expert advice to guide you on your journey to improve your MacBook Pro's performance.

Firstly, it's important to note that the Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display comes with an SSD that is not designed to be user-replaceable. However, that doesn't mean it's impossible to upgrade your SSD. You'll just need to be a bit more careful and ensure that you purchase a compatible SSD.

One option is to purchase an SSD directly from Apple. This guarantees compatibility, but it also comes with a higher price tag. Another option is to purchase an aftermarket SSD. These can be more cost-effective, but they also require a bit more research to find one that is compatible with your MacBook Pro.

The most important factor to consider when purchasing an SSD for your Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display is the physical form factor of the SSD. The Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display uses a proprietary SSD interface known as PCIe 2.0 x4, which limits your options. The physical form factor of your SSD needs to be compatible with this interface.

The best way to ensure compatibility is to consult your MacBook Pro’s documentation, which can be found on Apple’s website. Alternatively, you can contact an Apple support specialist and get an expert advice. They can guide you through the process and recommend the best SSD for your MacBook Pro's specific model.

One trusted aftermarket SSD brand is OWC, which offers SSDs that are guaranteed to be compatible with the Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display. These SSDs also come with installation instructions, making it easier for you to upgrade your MacBook Pro's SSD.

To sum up, upgrading your Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display SSD can significantly improve your computer's performance. However, you need to choose a compatible SSD to ensure the upgrade will work. The physical form factor is crucial when selecting an SSD. Consult Apple’s documentation or seek advice from a specialist for the best results.

Now that you have expert advice, upgrade your Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina Display SSD with confidence and enjoy faster performance and more productivity.

## Chosen Solution
 HI,
I'm trying to figure out whether the SSD part number 655-1816B is compatible with  MBP 13" Early 2015. I know according to iFixit, the 655-1816A is compatible. Is there much difference between the 2 revisions. It seems very tricky to navigate the various identifying numbers and their compatibility with the various models. Both versions seem to share another identifying character string, which is THNSN2128GSPS if that helps. Hopefully someone can shed some light on this, as it has me pretty much beaten.
Thank you in advance,
Aonghus

 The best way I know to figure this out is to hold it up to the screen and count the pins and compare it to the pictures.

 Hi,
Thank you for your response, however it’s not a question of them physically fitting, but whether or not they are compatible or run optimally eg the transfer rate may not be well matched etc.  I know that they will physically fit & have the correct number of pins, but from what I understand this doesn’t necessarily mean they are suitable. It seems to be very difficult to be sure from what I have researched. I couldn’t find any definitive guide; it would be great if there was one.
