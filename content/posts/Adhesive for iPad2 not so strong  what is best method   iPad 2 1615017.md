Introduction

The iPad 2 is a popular device that has been used by many people all over the world. However, there has been a significant problem that some users have reported regarding the adhesive that holds the device together. Some users have noticed that over time, the iPad 2 adhesive has weakened, causing the device to fall apart. This problem can be very frustrating, especially if you have invested a lot of money in the device. In this article, we will be discussing the ultimate fix for the weak adhesive problem, so you won't have to worry about your iPad 2 falling apart.

The Problem with Weak Adhesive

The adhesive that holds your iPad 2 together is a crucial component of the device. It ensures that every part of the device stays in place and works as intended. However, over time, the adhesive may weaken due to several factors, such as exposure to heat and humidity or the natural wear and tear of the device. When this happens, the different components of the iPad 2 may start to come apart, making it difficult to use or altogether unusable.

The Ultimate Fix

The ultimate fix for weak adhesive on your iPad 2 is to replace the adhesive itself. This process can be done by yourself, and it is not a complex task, but it requires some degree of technical knowledge. Here are some steps you need to follow to replace the adhesive on your iPad 2.

Step 1: Purchase the Necessary Materials

To replace the adhesive, you will need to purchase a kit that comes with a replacement adhesive and a set of tools that you will use to remove the old adhesive. These kits are readily available from online retailers and are affordable.

Step 2: Disassemble the iPad 2

To replace the adhesive, you will need to disassemble your iPad 2. First, remove the screws underneath the dock connector port, and then use a plastic pry tool to remove the back cover. Be gentle while doing this to avoid damaging any internal components.

Step 3: Remove the Old Adhesive

Before applying the new adhesive, you need to remove the old one first. Use a plastic pry tool to scrape off the old adhesive carefully. Be sure not to scratch the interior surface while scraping off the old adhesive.

Step 4: Apply the New Adhesive

Once you have removed the old adhesive, you can now apply the new one. Peel off the backing of the new adhesive and carefully apply it to the areas where the old adhesive was removed. Use a plastic tool or your fingers to press the new adhesive firmly in place.

Step 5: Reassemble the iPad 2

After applying the new adhesive, you can now reassemble the iPad 2 in reverse order. Put the back cover back in place, screw in the dock connector port screws, and your iPad 2 should now be as good as new!

Conclusion

If your iPad 2 is falling apart because of weak adhesive, there is no need to worry. The ultimate fix for the weak adhesive problem is to replace the adhesive itself. While the process may require some degree of technical knowledge, it is still achievable with the help of a replacement kit and some diligence. Follow the steps in this article carefully, and you should be able to fix the adhesive on your iPad 2 in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 I purchased adhesive off the internet and it seems to be the popular kind that everyone is selling/buying.
I changed battery in my ipad 2 and used this adhesive to put screen back. all seemed well and nice and the screen seems fine after a few days...
Buttttt....I go to open up the ipad 2 again, and the screen came off way to easily, adhesive was not so strong after all.  The original apple adhesive was difficult, but not the one I purchased.  What can I do to make sure future screens are in more securely than this.
Thanks
