# Discover the Jaw-Dropping Secret About your Iphone 6 Antenna Points and How to Get Stronger Cellular Signal!

If you are an iPhone 6 user, you might be wondering why your cellular signal is not as strong as you want it to be. One of the things you might not have considered is the potential issue with your antenna points.

Yes, you read that right. Your iPhone 6 has antenna points that play a crucial role in ensuring that you get good cellular signal strength. In this article, we are going to discuss the jaw-dropping secret about your iPhone 6 antenna points and how to get a stronger cellular signal.

## Understanding Antenna Points

Do you know that your iPhone 6 has two antenna points located at the bottom of the device? These points are responsible for sending and receiving signals to and from your mobile network's tower. If the antenna points are covered or obstructed in any way, your cellular signal strength will decrease.

As such, you need to be mindful of where you hold your device. You should avoid covering the antenna points with your hands or fingers as this will weaken the signal strength. Apple has also acknowledged this issue and recommended that users hold their devices in a way that avoids covering the antenna points.

## The Jaw-Dropping Secret About Your Antenna Points

Now that you understand the importance of your iPhone 6 antenna points, let's dive into the jaw-dropping secret about them. Did you know that your iPhone 6 antenna points can corrode over time, leading to weak signal strength? Yes, that's right.

Corrosion occurs when there is exposure to moisture or humidity, which can cause the antenna points to rust and weaken signal strength. This is a common issue among iPhone 6 users, especially those who live in areas with high humidity levels.

## How to Get Stronger Cellular Signal

The good news is that there are ways to fix weak cellular signal strength caused by corroded antenna points. Here are some tips that can help you get stronger cellular signal:

### 1. Clean the Antenna Points

The first thing you need to do is clean the antenna points. You can use a soft-bristled brush or a toothbrush to gently scrub the corrosion off the points. Be careful not to damage or scratch the points while cleaning them.

### 2. Keep Your iPhone Dry

If you live in an area with high humidity levels, make sure you keep your iPhone dry at all times. You can use a protective case that is waterproof or water-resistant to prevent moisture from getting into your device.

### 3. Use an Antenna Booster

Another way to improve your iPhone 6 signal strength is by using an antenna booster. These boosters can attach to your device and amplify the signal strength. However, be careful when choosing an antenna booster as some can cause interference with other devices.

### 4. Reset Your Network Settings

Sometimes, resetting your network settings can also help improve your iPhone 6 signal strength. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will reset your device's network settings to their default state, potentially improving your signal strength.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the importance of your iPhone 6 antenna points and how they can corrode over time, it's time to take action to improve your cellular signal strength. By following the tips we've shared in this article, you can improve your signal strength and enjoy a better mobile experience. Remember to keep your device dry and avoid covering the antenna points to ensure optimal signal strength.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello, have been trying to fix my iphone for days now. Got the searching...-text in the top corner and have tried replacing cellular antenna assebly down at the bottom two times. Then it has worked for a day or two until it hasnt anymore. Today I opened my phone, took out the speaker, and put it in again. Then it worked when I pressed on the screen in the speaker-area so, pretty sure there is bad contact somewhere. Anyone know where all the antennas connection points to the chassis are so I can try and get it working again?
Thankyou in advance!

 The primary cellular antenna is the bottom bezel, connect to the dock flex by the 2 screws near the lightning connector, then there is a coax cable running to the lower end of the logic board.
The diversity antenna is the top bezel, connect to the logic board by the bracket below the 5GHz wifi antenna(the standalone antenna on the top left). Then the signal runs through the RF cables on the back of the board to the cellular module, the lower half of the logic board.
If you lost primary, the phone would still work, so I believe this could be a board issue, not just the antennas.
