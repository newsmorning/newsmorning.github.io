Title: Shocking Revelation: iPhone 6S Plus suffers water damage and refuses to turn on – Find out what went wrong!

Introduction

Your iPhone 6S Plus is a prized possession, and it’s easy to understand why. It has a sleek design, offers exceptional performance, and is equipped with cutting-edge technology that makes your life easier. However, if your iPhone suffers water damage, it can spell disaster. If your iPhone 6S Plus refuses to turn on after coming into contact with water, don’t panic. We’ve got you covered. In this article, we’ll explain what causes water damage to your iPhone 6S Plus and how to prevent it in the future.

What causes water damage to your iPhone 6S Plus?

Water damage is a common problem that affects many smartphones, including the iPhone 6S Plus. There are several ways water can penetrate your phone's internal components, causing damage. Some of the most common reasons include:

1. Accidental drops in water

Accidents happen, and one of the most common causes of water damage to your iPhone 6S Plus is accidental drops in water. Whether you drop it in a pool, sink, or toilet, water can seep into the phone, leading to irreparable damage.

2. Humidity

Humidity can also cause damage to your phone, especially if you live in a humid environment. Exposure to high humidity for an extended period can cause moisture to build up in your phone, leading to corrosion.

3. Moisture

Moisture can also cause water damage to your iPhone 6S Plus, even if it doesn't come into direct contact with water. For instance, if you leave your phone in a damp or moist environment, such as a bathroom, moisture can build up and cause damage.

4. Accidental spills

Accidental spills, such as coffee or soda, can also cause water damage to your iPhone 6S Plus. It's essential to clean your phone immediately if it comes into contact with liquids.

What to do if your iPhone 6S Plus suffers water damage?

If your iPhone 6S Plus suffers water damage, here are some steps you should take immediately:

1. Turn off your phone

The first step you should take is to turn off your phone to prevent further damage. Don't attempt to turn it back on, as this can cause a short circuit.

2. Remove the SIM card

Remove the SIM card and any other peripherals from your phone, such as headphones and cases. This will help to prevent moisture from entering your phone.

3. Dry your phone

Use a soft, absorbent cloth to dry your phone as much as possible. Don't use a hairdryer or microwave to dry your phone, as this can cause further damage.

4. Rice trick

Place your phone in a bowl of uncooked rice, making sure it's completely submerged. Rice acts as a natural desiccant and absorbs the moisture from your phone. Leave it in the rice for at least 24 hours.

5. Professional help

If your iPhone 6S Plus still refuses to turn on, it's best to seek professional help. Apple offers a repair service for water-damaged iPhones, but this can be costly. Alternatively, you can take your phone to a local repair shop.

How to prevent water damage to your iPhone 6S Plus?

Preventing water damage is key to ensuring your iPhone 6S Plus lasts as long as possible. Here are some tips to help prevent water damage:

1. Invest in a waterproof case

Invest in a waterproof case to protect your phone from accidental drops in water.

2. Keep your phone dry

Try to keep your phone dry at all times, especially when you're around water. Avoid taking your phone to the pool or beach.

3. Be careful with beverages

Be careful when drinking beverages around your phone. If you spill something, clean your phone immediately.

4. Use a dehumidifier

If you live in a humid environment, using a dehumidifier can help to reduce the amount of moisture in the air and protect your phone.

Conclusion

Water damage can be a nightmare for iPhone 6S Plus owners, but by following the tips above, you can prevent it from happening. If you do suffer water damage, don't panic. Try the rice trick first and seek professional help if necessary. Remember, prevention is better than cure, so take steps to protect your phone from water damage in the first place.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a I phone 6s plus that went for a short swim in my pocket. I have opened the phone and dried out all the components and cleaned the connections. I didn't see any corrosion on the connectors.  The phone still doesn't fire up at all, and is not recognized when plugged  into the computer.  I'm guessing its possible the logic board is fried or  maybe just the battery? Should I try replacing the battery next? Any advise would be great thanks.  :)

 Hello Scott,
I would recommend bringing it to a Apple Store and see what they say. I would say trying to replace the battery is not a bad Idea. I would purchase a battery and try it. Even if it does not work you will have the extra battery just in case  you need to repair another phone in the future.
I wish you the best of luck with your predicament.
Have a great one,
