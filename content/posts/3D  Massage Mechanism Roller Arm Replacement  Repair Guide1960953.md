# Say Goodbye to Expensive Repairs! DIY Guide to Fixing Your 3D Massage Chair for Under $50!

Purchasing a 3D massage chair is a significant investment. Investing in a decent quality massage chair can be pricey, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Since a massage chair is something you would likely use for relaxation and stress relief, having it break down can cause more stress than relaxation. It is essential to maintain and repair the issues that arise in your massage chair to get the most out of it.

If you think repairing a massage chair is expensive, you're not wrong, but that does not mean you have to spend a lot of money every time you encounter a problem. Fixing some issues in your massage chair can be done by yourself, given you have some basic knowledge of the components, spare parts, and tools required for the repair. This DIY guide will help you troubleshoot and repair critical issues in your 3D massage chair while saving you hundreds of dollars.

## Diagnose the Issue

The first step is to identify the problem. Most issues in a massage chair are related to four components: power supply, PCB board, motor, or controller. You'll also need a set of tools in case you have to disassemble some parts of your massage chair. Here are the tools you'll need:

- Screwdrivers
- Pliers
- Multimeter

Once you have the above tools, diagnose the issue that the massage chair is facing. If the massage chair isn't turning on or seems to be malfunctioning, it could be due to the power supply. Ensure that the power outlet is working, and there are no loose connections or cable cuts. If the power outlet is working fine, check the transformer to ensure that it is working correctly.

If the power supply is safe, check the PCB board by looking at the circuitry diagram. A multimeter comes in handy to check the voltage, resistance, and continuity of various components on the PCB board.

If the PCB board appears fine, check the motor. The motor is the primary component that drives the rollers and movables in the massage chair, and if it's damaged, the chair won't function correctly.

The last thing to check is the controller. The controller is the device you use to adjust the massage chair's settings. Ensure that it's not damaged and that its connectors are tightly connected.

## Repair the Issue

After identifying the problem, you can now set out to fix it. Here are some common issues in a 3D massage chair and how to fix them affordably:

### Power Cable Issues

If the problem is related to the power cable, you can purchase a replacement cable for around $15. Replace the cable, test the power outlet, and turn on the massage chair.

### PCB Board Issues

Suppose the issue is related to the PCB board. In that case, you can replace any blown fuses, capacitors, or resistors on the board by purchasing them from an electronics store. The cost can be around $20.

### Motor Issues

If the issue is due to the motor, you can purchase a replacement motor for about $30. Begin by removing the faulty motor and installing the new one.

### Controller Issues

Suppose the controller is the contributing factor. In that case, you can replace it with a compatible controller. First, check the compatibility of your massage chair with the controller before purchasing one online for approximately $20.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, repairing a 3D massage chair is not as difficult or as costly as you might imagine. With the right tools, time, and guidance, you can fix most of the issues yourself without spending a lot of money or seeking professional help. However, if the issue is complex or unclear, it's best to consult a professional to avoid causing further damage to your massage chair.

Step 2


 
- 
 - Remove the 2 Phillips head screws . This cover is located on the front of the mechanism.
 - 
 - Now spin the 3D motor belt .
 - 
 - By spinning this belt will move the 3D gears to the furthest position.
 - 
 - If you don't spin this motor the steps after this will not be possible to complete

Step 5


 
- 
 - Remove the upper Nut and washer .
 - 
 - Remove lower Teflon piece by removing all 3 screws.
 - 
 - In order to remove one of the three screws you will have to insert your screw driver behind the 3D motor Belt. Mind you this only applies to the LEFT side roller arm

- 
 - Remove nut and washer.
 - 
 - lock the vice grips onto the kneading motor shaft. while using a wrench at the same time to loosen the nut.
 - 
 - PLEASE DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN THE VICE GRIPS. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY DAMAGE THE SHAFT.

Step 8


 
- 
 - The roller arms have wires going to a sensor board on the back side of the mechanism. Remove this plastic mount mount.
 - 
 - This wire will plug into a small PCB on the back side of the mechanism . I don't have the PCB in this photo but once you follow the wire its self explanatory

                  Reassembly Tricks               


 
- 
 - When reinstalling this outer nut cover it will appear like it doesn't fit . It needs to be attached by evenly screwing in the bolts at the same time. example: screw in one bolt half way, screw in the other 2 half way, repeat until secure.
 - 
 - Beware you may have difficulty removing roller arms from the shaft, i assure you it will come off.  Sometimes its a matter of spinning the kneading motor until you have a enough space. See Step 3
 - 
 - Please note on your mechanism you may have to cut zip ties to free up the roller arm cable. please apply new zip ties as necessary.
