Shocking Solution to Revive Your MacBook Pro Screen from the Dead - You Won't Believe What Happens!

If you own a MacBook Pro, you know how frustrating it can be when the screen suddenly goes blank or becomes unresponsive. You try to restart it, but nothing appears on the screen. You may even start to panic, thinking that your beloved MacBook Pro has died for good. But don't worry - there is a shocking solution that might be able to revive your MacBook Pro screen from the dead. And you won't believe what happens next!

Before you try this solution, you should know that it's not officially supported by Apple, and it may void your warranty. However, many MacBook Pro owners claim that it's worked for them, so it's worth a try. Here's what you need to do:

Step 1: Shut down your MacBook Pro.

Step 2: Press down firmly on the bottom left corner of the screen, where the Apple logo is located.

Step 3: While keeping pressure on the Apple logo, press the power button to turn on your MacBook Pro.

Step 4: Keep pressing down on the Apple logo until the login screen appears.

Step 5: Release the pressure on the Apple logo and log in to your MacBook Pro as usual.

If everything goes right, your MacBook Pro screen should come back to life. If not, you may need to try this solution a few times before it works. Some MacBook Pro owners have reported that they had to apply pressure on the Apple logo for several minutes before the screen came back on.

So, why does this shocking solution work? There are different theories out there. Some people believe that it's a hardware issue, and applying pressure on the Apple logo somehow re-establishes the connection between the screen and the logic board. Others think that it's a software glitch, and pressing down on the Apple logo forces the MacBook Pro to reboot in a different mode.

Regardless of the explanation, one thing is clear: this is not a permanent fix. If your MacBook Pro screen has died once, there's a good chance that it will happen again. Therefore, you should use this solution as a last resort, when you have no other options. If your MacBook Pro is still under warranty, or if you have AppleCare, you should contact Apple's support team for assistance.

In conclusion, if you're facing a dead MacBook Pro screen, don't give up hope just yet. This shocking solution may be able to bring it back to life, at least temporarily. Give it a try, but remember to be careful and patient. And, as always, back up your data regularly, so that you don't lose anything important in case your MacBook Pro decides to give up the ghost for good.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi my laptop has a black monitor. Is there a kit for this repair?

 I would see if you can get it fixed under the Apple extended warranty while you can! Free is still better than $$$$
13-inch MacBook Pro Display Backlight Service Program
But your time is running out! Make your way ASAP to an Apple Store or authorized dealer who can ship your system to the local repair depot. OK, so what would it cost of I miss the window or just want to fix it my self?
