As a loyal user of the Acer Chromebook C720, I was excited to discover something surprising and unexpected when entering my password. It all started when I turned on my Chromebook and was prompted to enter my password as usual. However, this time, something different happened.

As I entered my password and hit the enter key, the screen suddenly displayed a congratulatory message, complete with confetti falling from the top of the screen. At first, I was taken aback and wondered if something had gone wrong with the system. But then, I read the message and realized what had happened.

It turns out that Acer has added a fun and enjoyable Easter egg to the C720 Chromebook's password entry system. Whenever you enter the correct password, the system will display the message "Great job! You entered your password correctly!" accompanied by celebratory graphics.

This fun addition to the Chromebook's password entry process adds an unexpected element of surprise and delight to an otherwise mundane task. It's a small but thoughtful touch that makes using the Chromebook just a little bit more enjoyable.

But it's not just the fun message that makes the C720 a great choice for users. This Chromebook is known for its fast performance, long battery life, and lightweight design, making it an ideal option for people who want a reliable device for work or play.

Overall, I'm thrilled to have discovered this unexpected surprise on my Acer C720 Chromebook. It's a small detail that adds to the already enjoyable experience of using this device. If you're looking for a reliable and fun Chromebook, the Acer C720 is definitely worth considering.

 Hi Raguraman!
This may have been a cooperate laptop that was issued to the education sector.
However!  There is a way around the problem.  If you press (Ctrl +d) twice and enter into developer mode.  The chromebook will refresh the system back to how it was when new, taking to the (welcome) splash screen.   DO_NOT_UNPLUG the mains or switch it off, otherwise this will corrupt the system, rendering the machine SERVICEABLE!   You will need to press (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + r) once in the welcome screen to delete any BIOS passwords,  the system will prompt you again, as it goes through a full power-wash,  press the continue key, and after a few minutes the Chromebook will resetâ€¦
