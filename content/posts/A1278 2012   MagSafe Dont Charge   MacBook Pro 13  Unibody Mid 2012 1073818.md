#Is Your Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 Not Charging? You Won't Believe the Solution! 

Do you own a Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012 and are experiencing charging issues? You're not alone. As Apple products age, their batteries lose their ability to hold a charge, making it harder for them to function. However, there's a quick and easy solution that you won't believe is the answer to your Macbook's charging problems.

The Macbook Pro 2012 is an excellent machine that offers high-end features such as a Retina display and a powerful processor. It's also known for its durability and longevity, thanks to its unibody construction. However, there are times when the battery doesn't charge, which can be frustrating, especially if you need to use your Macbook on the go.

If you're experiencing charging issues with your Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012, don't worry, the solution is easier than you might think. All you need to do is reset your Macbook's System Management Controller (SMC). This might sound complicated, but it's a simple process that anyone can do.

The SMC is a chip that manages your Macbook's power-related functions. When it's faulty or misconfigured, it can cause charging issues. To reset it, you need to follow these simple steps:

- Shut down your Macbook and disconnect any external power sources
- Hold down the Shift+Control+Option keys, and the Power button simultaneously
- Release all the keys and press the Power button again to turn on your Macbook

Your Macbook's SMC has now been reset, and you should be able to charge your Macbook without any issues. If, for some reason, the SMC reset doesn't work, you might have a faulty battery that needs to be replaced.

In conclusion, if you're experiencing charging issues with your Macbook Pro 13 Unibody Mid 2012, don't panic. The solution is simple: reset your Macbook's SMC. By doing so, you'll be able to charge your Macbook and get back to using it without any interruptions. If you're still experiencing problems, it's best to take your Macbook to an authorized Apple repair center for further diagnosis and repair.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I have a Macbook Pro A1278 2012
No led light at all on the MagSafe. No battery charging. What can I do? I tried a NEW battery and it didn't work and I tried a NEW DC-IN and it didnt work also.
Thanks.

 You seem to have a lot of different Macs.
First try disconnecting the battery from the logic board.  Also the mag-safe.
Press and hold the power on button for 5 seconds.  Reconnect and give it a try.
A history of the machine might help.  Let us know if your get anything, lights sounds, etc.

 Important to know the history of the machine, any drops, spills etc.  If you don't know the history you will need a schematic, board view and a multimeter and you will want to start test the power rails to see what is and is not present.  Once you have narrowed done what power rail is missing you can then begin to diagnose the issue.  I have attached the page you need to get started testing start with PPBUS_G3H
