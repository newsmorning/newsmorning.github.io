Understanding what these terms are, their meaning, and types can save you money, prevent disputes, and improve your overall business efficiency. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the importance of Incoterms and payment terms and provide some examples to help you understand how they work.\nWhat are Incoterms? International Commercial Terms or Incoterms are a set of rules that define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international trade transactions. They are designed to facilitate international trade and ensure that both parties clearly understand their obligations when it comes to the delivery of goods. Incoterms cover issues such as transport, insurance, customs clearance, and risk allocation.\nTypes of Incoterms There are 11 Incoterms rules that are currently in use - they are grouped in four main categories:\nEXW – Ex Works Ex Works means that the seller has fulfilled their obligation to deliver the goods once they make the items available to the buyer at their premises. The buyer takes full responsibility for loading the goods onto the transport vehicle, and any subsequent transportation and clearance procedures are entirely their responsibility.\nFAS – Free Alongside Ship Free Alongside Ship stipulates that the seller has responsibility for delivering the goods alongside the ship, either at the port of shipment or a named port. The buyer takes responsibility for loading the goods onto the vessel and paying for further transportation.\nCIF – Cost, Insurance \u0026 Freight CIF is a term used in maritime shipping, where the seller is responsible for arranging and paying for the shipment of the goods to the port of destination, including the costs of insurance and freight. The buyer takes possession of the goods once they are loaded onto the vessel.\nDDP – Delivered Duty Paid Delivered Duty Paid requires the seller to cover all costs and risks related to transporting the goods to the buyer’s location, including customs clearance, duties, taxes, and other associated costs. The seller also delivers the goods to the agreed-upon location.\nWhat are Payment Terms? Payment terms are the conditions under which a seller accepts payment from a buyer. In a standard sales agreement, payment terms specify the payment method, payment amount, and deadline for payment. Payment terms are essential when it comes to managing cash flow and ensuring that accounts receivable are collected on time.\nTypes of Payment Terms Letter of Credit (L/C) A letter of credit is a payment method where the buyer’s bank guarantees payment to the seller once the goods are delivered according to the terms of the letter of credit. This method provides security for both the buyer and the seller and reduces the risk of non-payment.\nOpen Account An open account is a payment term that establishes a line of credit between the buyer and the seller. In this arrangement, the buyer agrees to pay the seller by a specific date, usually 30, 60, or 90 days after the invoice date.\nConclusion In summary, understanding Incoterms and payment terms is crucial for businesses that conduct international trade. Knowing the meanings and types of these terms can help you avoid confusion, ensure timely deliveries, and maintain a healthy cash flow. It is essential to communicate these terms clearly with your business partners, and if necessary, seek professional advice to ensure that your business is well-protected. With the right understanding and planning, you can avoid costly disputes and save your business both time and money.\nIncoterms Meaning You are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Incoterms (wallstreetmojo.com)\nInternational Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publishes and authorizes international commercial terms. Different abbreviations are used depending on the mutually agreed-upon conditions and clauses between an importer and an exporter.\nKey Takeaways\nThe incoterms are authorized commercial terms used in international trade and logistics.The International Chamber of Commerce legalizes these terms. The ICC headquarters is situated in Paris, France. In 2022, more than 100 countries will comply with ICC standards.There are 11 types of incoterms, FCA, FAB, FOB, EXW, CIPT CIP, CFR, CIF, DAP, DDT, and PDF.International commercial terms are also mentioned on shipping documents. Incoterms Explained Incoterms are regulations that are to be followed in international trade and logistics. When commercial terms are standardized internationally, import-export operations become faster and hassle-free. International commercial terms are governed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).\nICC was established in 1919 to facilitate international trade. Initially, ICC had only 13 member nations The rest of the world had its own import-export rules. The disparity in international trade regulation created chaos.\nIn 1928, International commercial term charts improved, and ICC expanded to 30 member nations. The most recent International commercial terms amendment took place in September 2019. In 2022, more than 100 countries will comply with ICC standards.\nThe updated International commercial terms table is accepted by legal authorities worldwide and thus plays a pivotal role in international trade and transactions. It creates transparency between the buyer and seller. International commercial terms dictate regulations about costs, risks, location, fees, and tasks. International commercial terms are also mentioned on shipping documents.\nSince 2020, the exploitation of international trade has been witnessed; International commercial terms are being misused. Exporters are not using the correct abbreviation. For example, FOB (Free On Board) refers to sellers moving goods independently. But exporters label it as CIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid To); CIP only requires sellers to pay for the transport, and a third party carries out the actual transportation.\nIt is becoming a severe issue. As a result, countries are trying to make the necessary changes to resolve the complications—better access to documentation, regular training on updated rules, and promotion.\nTypes of Incoterms Incoterms are further divided into four types. The subtypes are further divided; all in all, there are 11 International commercial terms:\n#1 – Category E (Departure)\nEXW (Ex Works) #2 – Category F (Main consignment unpaid)\nFCA (Free Carrier)FAS (Free Alongside Ship)FOB (Free on Board) #3 – Category C (The main consignment paid)\nCPT (Carriage paid to)CIP (Carriage and Insurance paid to)CFR (Cost and Freight)CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) #4 – Category D (Arrival)\nDAP (Delivered at Place)DPU (Delivered at Place Unloaded)DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) Example Let us look at an incoterms example to understand the procedure better.\nLet us assume that Gary enters a DDP deal with Jeremy. Jeremy is an exporter who operates from London ports. Gary is an importer who operates from US shores (New York).\nIn 2022, Gary purchases a battery consignment from Jeremy. However, according to DDP International commercial terms, Jeremy has to pay for the transportation and storage costs (London port to New York port). Moreover, if the batteries get damaged, Jeremy has to bear the loss.\nOnce the battery consignment arrives in the New York port, Gary (buyer) will pay for the unloading of the batteries. Meanwhile, Jeremy covers costs like local taxes, tariffs, and customs duties.\nAccording to 2022 incoterms, if the contract mentions a terminal destination, Jeremy (seller) is free from additional freight expenses. But if the agreement mentions Gary’s address, Jeremy must pay freight expenses.\nUnder DDP terms, Jeremy (seller) knows all the costs and risks included. In turn, sellers charge extra for the risks. As a result, Gary bears fewer risks but ends up paying more.\nAdvantages And Disadvantages The advantages and disadvantages of incoterms are as follows:\nInternational commercial terms offer uniformity in communication between two parties.It is accepted worldwide. International commercial terms encourage transparency.International commercial terms save time and reduce red tape. It facilitates the control of the supply chain.International commercial terms streamline the entire trading and shipping process. Now let us look at the disadvantages:\nFirst, companies need help to keep pace with all the modifications.Buyers and sellers can have different preferences—one might prefer a CIF, another a FOB. But, in the end, one of them has to concede. Practically, this isn’t easy because there are too many deal structures.Companies misuse International commercial terms. For example, they use one abbreviation for shipping documents and another for purchase invoices. This way, firms attempt cost-cutting malpractices. Incoterms vs Payment Terms Let us look at incoterms vs payment terms comparison to distinguish between the two.\nInternational commercial terms are used for cross-border and overseas trade. In contrast, payment terms are used for domestic trades.International commercial terms are agreed upon with the freight carrier, but payment terms are discussed with the seller.International commercial terms cite which party is responsible for loading, transporting, and unloading. In contrast, payment terms predominantly focus on the payment details—which party pays for which process. Recommended Articles This article has been a guide to Incoterms \u0026 its meaning.
