Once done, restart your computer and attempt to connect to your printer. You should notice improved printer functionality and fewer issues.

## 5. Clear Your Printing Queue

If you find that you're not printing out documents at all or are dealing with slow printing speeds, try clearing your print queue. You may have too many print jobs on the list, resulting in printing delays. To clear your queue, click on the printer icon in your computer's system tray, select “see what’s printing,” and then choose “cancel all documents.” 

Conclusion:

Configuring printers can be confounding, but it doesn’t have to be a harrowing task. By ensuring that you have the correct printer driver, checking your printer's connection, restarting the printer, installing the latest software updates, and clearing the printing queue, you’ll eliminate most printer configuration troubles.
