Find Out Why it Goes Blank When You Connect the Power Supply!\nIf you are an Acer laptop user, chances are you may have encountered an unusual problem where your laptop screen goes blank when you connect the power supply. This can be a frustrating experience, especially if you rely on your Acer laptop for work or entertainment. However, do not be alarmed, as this problem can easily be solved.\nFirstly, this issue can be caused by a power setting on your laptop that is automatically set to save power, also known as the “Power Saver” mode. To check this setting, go to the power options in the control panel and make sure that the power plan is set to “Balanced” or “High Performance” and not the “Power Saver” mode. This may solve your problem and your laptop may not go blank when you connect the power supply anymore.\nSecondly, this issue can also be caused by a faulty battery. If you have been using the same battery for a long time, there is a chance that it may have reached the end of its life and needs to be replaced. A faulty battery can cause your Acer laptop to shut down randomly or to go blank when you connect the power supply. Therefore, it is recommended that you get a new battery for your laptop to solve this issue.\nLastly, this issue can also be caused by a hardware problem within your laptop. If the previous two solutions do not work, it may be time to take your Acer laptop to a service center to have it repaired. The hardware problem might be something as simple as a loose connection within the laptop or it could be a more complex issue such as a malfunctioning motherboard. Either way, taking your laptop to a professional will help you diagnose the problem and get it fixed.\nIn conclusion, the blank screen issue on your Acer laptop when you connect the power supply can be easily resolved by checking your power settings, getting a new battery or taking it to a service center for repair. The key is not to panic, be patient, and to follow the necessary steps. So, if you have this issue with your Acer laptop, do not hesitate to follow these steps and solve the problem for a better user experience.\nChosen Solution acer goes blank when power supply connected ,since windows 10 up date\nIt does not turn off the screen goes blank thanks for any help you can give\nSolution #1 To fix this issue, go into Power Options, Edit Plan Settings of the active plan, set Change plan brightness to the maximum for both battery and plugged in.
