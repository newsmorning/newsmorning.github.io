Title: Unlocking the Secret Barrier: The Shocking Truth About Why African Startups Struggle to Get Funding!

Introduction:
Africa is the world's second-largest continent by population with approximately 1.2 billion people, yet African startups continue to struggle in acquiring funding. Over the years, there has been a lot of buzz surrounding the African startup ecosystem, with the increasing number of success stories and tech-enabled innovations. Still, entrepreneurs in Africa face several challenges. And one of the significant hindrances to the growth of African startups is lack of funding.

What is the Secret Barrier?
The Secret Barrier is the invisible wall African startups face when attempting to secure funding. It is often said that African startups are riskier than their counterparts in the developed world, but that is only partially true. While it is correct that African startups have to operate in a more challenging business environment characterized by inadequate infrastructure and regulatory frameworks, the primary challenge that startups in Africa face is a lack of access to a diverse pool of investors.

Why do African Startups Struggle to Get Funding?
The scarce availability of funding in Africa is a considerable barrier to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. However, the critical issue is that the traditional venture capital (VC) model does not work in Africa due to several reasons, including cultural differences, regulatory frameworks, and market complexities. Many international VC firms are either hesitant to invest in African startups or lack the understanding of the African business environment.

Another significant challenge is the high risk involved in investing in African startups. Most African startups are in their early stages and lack the necessary infrastructure and networks to grow their businesses. Moreover, African startups operate in markets that are usually not very well understood and not easy to penetrate, such as the informal economy.

Furthermore, the lack of mentorship and networking opportunities can also hinder startups from realizing their full potential. Most investors in Africa are both silent and passive, which means they usually do not provide the support that startups need to overcome the significant challenges they face.

Unlocking the Secret Barrier
The African startup ecosystem needs a new and innovative approach to access funding. One of the critical changes that need to occur is the creation of a diverse pool of investors in Africa. Investors who are familiar with the African business environment and can support African startups both financially and strategically.

Furthermore, the regulatory frameworks in Africa need to be improved to attract investors, both local and foreign. Governments also need to create favorable policies and incentives that encourage investments in startups. States need to tailor policies that support entrepreneurs, such as access to funding, tax credits, and support with infrastructure, which will help create a conducive environment where startups can thrive.

Lastly, there is a need for more mentorship and networking opportunities for African startups. Mentors and investors can play significant roles in supporting entrepreneurs, including providing access to funding, networking opportunities and helping them navigate the challenges of operating in Africa.

Conclusion:
African startups have the potential to make a significant impact on the continent's economy, create jobs, and provide solutions to social issues. However, unlocking funding is a significant challenge that needs to be addressed for these startups to grow and realize their full potential. The Secret Barrier needs to be broken down by creating a diverse pool of investors, improving regulatory frameworks, and providing more mentorship and networking opportunities. Only then can we truly unlock the potential of the African startup ecosystem.

One of the reasons fronted for the stagnant progress with Startups on the African continent is mainly lack of capital or funding from family, friends or financial institutions.  For comparative reasons, consider a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) that indicates that Venture capitalists invested $17.5 billion in 1,189 deals in the second quarter of 2015 in the US market. We have no stats for how much was invested on the African continent.
 
At the recently concluded African Technology Summit, an event  organized by MEST,  Seedstars World’s CEO Alisee de Tonnac gave insights into the investment landscape in the continent. According to Alisee, inexperience from investors and entrepreneurs on fundraising, lack of competition among investors, lack of standardization are some of the reasons why startups still find it hard to raise capital from family & friends or Venture Capital firms. Here are all the other reasons;
 
- There is a lack of experience, both from investors and from entrepreneurs on how to run a fundraising process
 - Government and tax regulations are still burdensome and disincentivize startup investing
 - There is a lack of competition among investors, lowering valuations and delaying decision times
 - Wealthy people still prefer to invest in real estate or other traditional industries with guaranteed returns
 - There is a lack of standardization in the fundraising process, making it unnecessary burdensome and lengthy.

 
Despite the hurdles, there’s been much optimism in the African market especially in the technology sector. Africa has attracted a number of VC firms, incubators, accelerators and innovation hubs that are spread across the continent. For instance in the investment circles, there’s Meltwater entreprenuerial school of technology, Techstars, Omidyar network, 500 startups, Newgen angels. 2015 alone saw some startups raise about $1million in VC investment and they include Paga ($13m), Andela($10m) and Hotels.ng ($1.2m).  Here’s a link to the full presentation on Slideshare.
