TITLE: iPhone 6 Users Beware: Adhesive Strips FAIL to Secure Your Phone!

Introduction:
When it comes to our beloved smartphones, we are always looking for ways to keep them safe and protected. iPhone users are particularly fastidious about the accessories and measures they take to keep their phones secure from accidental drops and scratches. However, what if the planned protection backfires and puts your phone at risk instead? That is exactly what's happening with the adhesive strips used to secure the battery of iPhone 6. Read on to find out more.

Background:
Apple's signature sleek design and the quest for thinner phones have led to the company's decision to use adhesive strips to secure the battery in the iPhone 6 models. Instead of screws, the battery is tightly glued to the handset's casing using strong adhesives. This makes it very important for the adhesive strips to be strong enough to hold the battery in place, or else your phone could suffer from devastating consequences. 

The Problem:
Unfortunately, these adhesive strips have been found to be unreliable time and again. A simple Google search will yield numerous forums and posts from iPhone 6 users facing battery problems merely two years after the phone's launch. Many users have reported their batteries simply falling out of the phone. That's a scary prospect considering that the iPhone 6 has an internal battery that is impossible to remove without taking the phone apart. 

This is a serious design flaw on Apple's part. The adhesive strips are supposed to keep the battery secured in place, but that's not always the case. Many users have reported that their iPhone 6 simply stopped working without any warning signs. The root cause of "sudden death syndrome" of iPhone 6 is mainly attributed to the adhesive strips failing to hold the battery in place, causing it to short circuit and hence resulting in irreparable damage.

Solution:
If you are the owner of an iPhone 6, you need to take precautions to avoid your phone from suffering battery outages or sudden death. There are few measures you can take to enhance your phone's safety. Firstly, you should avoid exposing your phone to extreme temperatures, both hot and cold. This will compromise the strength of the adhesive strips, and hence, the battery could potentially fall out. 

Secondly, you should always take care when handling your phone. Try to avoid shaking, bumping, or dropping it. Any sudden movement can weaken the adhesive strips and put the battery at risk.

If you are having issues with your iPhone 6 battery, don't ignore them. You can take your phone to an authorized Apple repair center or contact their customer support for assistance. They might be able to fix or replace your phone free of cost if it falls under their limited warranty terms.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, iPhone 6 users should be extra cautious when it comes to the phone's battery's safety. The adhesive strips used to secure battery in the phone are failing to perform their job. While this is a major design flaw, it is not too late to take preventative measures. Avoid exposing your phone to extreme temperatures, handle it with care, and take your phone to an authorized Apple center for assistance if needed. By doing so, you can keep your phone safe from any unwanted battery failures.

## Chosen Solution
 Today I received my iPhone 6 battery replacement kit, complete with the new battery. After some difficulty removing the old battery, I grabbed my new one to pull the purple cover off the adhesives and place it in the phone. But, instead of the cover peeling away from the strips, it actually peeled off the adhesive strips from the battery! Now I need new adhesive strips, as I donâ€™t have any double sided tape at home. Is there anything else I can do?

 The only option is to order new adhesive strips or double sided tape. If you don't the battery will flop around and possibly do damage but surely annoy you to death.
