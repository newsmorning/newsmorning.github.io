# You Won't Believe What We Found When We Removed the Screen of the Acer Swift SF314-54! A Jaw-Dropping Revelation About the Acer Swift 3 You Can't Afford to Miss!

Are you looking for a laptop that is both sleek and powerful? Look no further than the Acer Swift SF314-54. This laptop boasts an impressive design and an impressive array of features. However, what we found when we removed the screen of the Acer Swift SF314-54 was nothing short of remarkable.

Without a doubt, the highlight of the Acer Swift SF314-54 is its slim design. This laptop is only 0.7 inches thick and weighs only 2.9 pounds. This incredible slimness makes the Acer Swift SF314-54 one of the lightest laptops on the market today.

But, when we removed the screen of the Acer Swift SF314-54, we found that it's not just a slim laptop- it's also a highly efficient one. The battery in this laptop is located underneath the touchpad. This innovative design allows the Acer Swift SF314-54 to have a larger battery than most other laptops of its size. The result? Up to 12 hours of battery life!

Another surprising revelation we discovered after removing the screen of the Acer Swift SF314-54 was the location of its speakers. Rather than being located on the bottom of the laptop, as is common with most laptops, the speakers of the Acer Swift SF314-54 are located on top of the keyboard. This unique placement of the speakers allows for a more immersive audio experience.

But, perhaps the most remarkable discovery we made when we removed the screen of the Acer Swift SF314-54 was the construction of the laptop. The Acer Swift SF314-54 is made with a high-grade, lightweight magnesium-aluminum alloy. This material not only gives the laptop an impressive level of durability but also makes it more thermally efficient. The result? A laptop that stays cool even during demanding tasks.

In conclusion, the Acer Swift SF314-54 is a laptop that exceeds all expectations. Its slim design, impressive battery life, top-placed speakers, and innovative construction make it a must-have for anyone in the market for a new laptop. So, if you're on the fence about whether or not to purchase the Acer Swift SF314-54, let our findings be the deciding factor. Trust us- you won't be disappointed!


## Chosen Solution
 Hi all, I have an  Acer swift sf314-54 which the screen needs replacing , however it dose not seem to be held in with screws to the back case like models before and ater it, I havent been able to find a ‘how to’ to remove it either, so dose someone have any advice on this please.

 The best advice I can pass along is to search for a service manual. This should have disassembly instructions.
