 I’ve lost too many machines when a connector broke off. I need an board level technician to replace/repair when I can’t, my skills being minimal. I just need a reference if you haven’t done business with them yourself.
I was going to post this in the microsoldering area but realize I nether know how to do that nor write to a specific member who might know.
