Keyboards are becoming an art form. Today, you
can find enthusiasts that are are as passionate about their mechanical
keyboards as anyone who collects sneakers, comic books, video games, or
anything else you can think of.
 
Just like with any collectible or piece of
fashion, the most prized items are usually those with quirky aesthetics or
exclusivity – if it looks interesting or is hard to find, people want it. The
same holds true with mechanical keyboards, and there has been a surge in
hipsteresque mechanical keyboard brands over the past decade.
 
You’ve probably heard of Razer, Corsair,
SteelSeries, and Logitech for their mechanical keyboards. There are plenty more
out there that haven’t got the same attention though. Gamers, especially Twitch
streamers, are now lifting some of these lesser-known brands to popularity.
 

 
Whether it is due to the build and feel of
these keyboards, their aesthetics, or just the feeling of finding out about
them before everyone else, many people are beginning to look towards
third-party and overseas retailers for the hottest new mechanical keyboards. In
this article, let’s talk about four brands that you should keep an eye out for.
 
## Ducky
 
Ducky keyboards, from Taiwan-based
DuckyChannel International Co., are probably the most recognized brand on this
list. World-famous gamers such as Tfue have been seen on stream using Ducky
keyboards, and they may be known best for collaborations with other popular brands,
producing loud and vibrant colorways.
 
For example, Ducky has collaborated with Razer to release a version of its Ducky One 2 model featuring Razer’s very own key switches. A more recent One 2 Mini collaboration Ducky has had is with Frozen Llama. The two teamed up to release a sleek 60% keyboard featuring cyan, purple, and baby blue PBT keycaps. This release was also limited to just 3,000 keyboards.
 
However, Ducky’s proprietary models, such as the Ducky Shine line, are nothing to shrug at. Features of the Ducky Shine 7 include double-shot PBT keycaps, support for Razer Chroma Broadcast, Ducky Macro 2.0, and Ducky’s own RGB software, three-level adjustable feet, RGB backlighting, and switch options including almost every Cherry MX color type.
 
Another perk that adds a bit of mystique to
buying a Ducky keyboard is that they will often ship with extra spacebars. For
the Ducky Shine 7 model, MechanicalKeyboards.com states, “You may receive
a Year of the Dog spacebar, Year of the Pig spacebar, or no extra spacebar at
all. We do not know what’s in the box at the time of shipping your order.”
 
## Anne
 
Anne keyboards, made famous by the Anne Pro and Anne Pro 2 models, are manufactured by Obins. Both models are known for their compact 61-key design. The Anne Pro line eliminates every key to the right of the Backspace key, as well as the F1–F12 function row, in favor of a single Function key.
 
Mechanical keyboards often come with a
reputation of being great for gaming, but the Anne Pro’s design may not be best
for this purpose. Although with the Function key, you can use the numerical row
as F1–F12 and WASD as arrows, many games will demand easier access to these
keys.
 
However, the Anne Pro 2, Obins’ flagship
keyboard, is fantastic for basic typing purpose. It ships with PBT keycaps,
support for connection via USB and BLE 4.0 (including a USB cable and Bluetooth
adapter), RGB backlighting, and a key puller.
 
Unlike many mechanical keyboards which ship
with Cherry MX switches, the Anne Pro and Anne Pro 2 feature Gateron switches –
Blue, Red, and Brown. Gateron is often reviewed as having smoother and less
scratchy switches when compared to Cherry.
 
You can read more about Anne keyboards and find them listed at the official Obins website (not natively in English) and Newegg.
 
## Leopold
 
Leopold keyboards often appeal to a niche set of enthusiasts who really love mechanical keyboards with a low-brow, retro aesthetic. Although they do feature some more colorful models, such as the FC750R Swedish Edition, most Leopold keyboards feature grays and blacks, although many of them are two-toned.
 
The unembellished style of Leopold keyboards carries over to its keyboards’ model names. While Ducky has the Shine and Anne has the Pro, Leopold is known for its FC750R, FC980M, FC660M, and similarly named models.
 
Leopold keyboards also feature a few very
interesting layouts. For example, the FC980M eliminates the bottom-leftmost key
of the number pad for a more compact design against the arrow keys. The FC660M
features a 65% layout where two keys “hang” in its top-right corner.
 
I’ve yet to see a Leopold model with
backlighting, and the vast majority feature PBT keycaps and Cherry MX switches
– Black, Brown, Blue, and Red, although many also offer the special Silent Red,
the FC980M additionally offers Clear, and the FC750R additionally offers Silver.
 
One of the most flashy Leopold models is the FC980C Black Dye. It features black-on-black (or very dark gray) PBT keycaps and Topre 45g switches. Leopold keyboards may not be about being flamboyant, but they come with no shortage of useful options.
 
## Akko
 
Akko is one of the most versatile keyboards
brands that you’ve probably never heard of. It’s nothing like Leopold – with
Akko, you’re going to get crazy colorways and a huge variety when it comes to
backlighting, shell patterns, and other aesthetics.
 
Like Ducky, some of Akko’s coolest keyboards are a product of collaborations. Coincidentally, one of their closest collaborators is Ducky—for example, the Akko X Ducky 3084, which features three shell and keycap colors (black, cyan, and pink) with engravings on the front of each key (instead of the top). There’s also the Akko X Ducky 3108S RGB, Akko X Ducky One 2 Skyline, and one of the loudest and wildest mechanical keyboards I’ve ever seen, the Akko X Ducky Shine 6 Year of the Monkey Limited Edition.
 
Again, though, just like Ducky, Akko’s solo models awesome. The Akko 3108 and 3087 models are its most famous, featuring versions such as the World Tour Beijing, 9009 Retro, Dragon Ball Z Vegeta, and Cupid.
 
The main draw to Akko is its variety, not only
in colorways but also switches and keyboard layouts. You’ll find Akko keyboards
with Cherry MX or Gateron switches, full-size, tenkeyless, and 60% layouts, and
several other styles. It’s difficult to fit Akko into a box due to how wide a
variety of keyboards it manufactures. 
 
However, If you’re looking for colorful
mechanical keyboards with some of the most beautiful spacebars in the industry,
Akko is worth your attention.
 
You can read more about Akko keyboards and find them listed at the official Akko website (not natively in English) and Newegg.
 
Whether it’s those thick PBT keycaps, compact
frames, clicky and tactile key switches, or just the beautiful assortment of
colors, these four brands have everything you need if you’re looking to impress
with a new mechanical keyboard.
