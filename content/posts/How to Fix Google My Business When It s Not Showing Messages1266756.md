Revive Your Google My Business with One Simple Fix! Learn How to Get Your Messages Back!

Google My Business is an essential tool for businesses of all sizes. It allows you to put your business on Google Maps and appear on local search results. Your business listing on Google My Business contains valuable information such as your phone number, website, hours of operation, and customer reviews.

One of the essential features of Google My Business is the messaging option that lets you communicate with your customers directly. However, in August 2020, there was an unfortunate incident where Google removed the messaging option from several Google My Business listings. 

As a result, businesses that relied on messaging as a means of communication with their customers were left stranded. Many businesses faced a communication breakdown, which ultimately affected their reputation, customer trust and loyalty, and overall revenue. 

The good news is that Google has fixed the messaging issue now, and as a business owner, you can quickly check if your messaging option is available or not. To do so, you need to follow these simple steps:

1. Log in to your Google My Business account.
2. Click on “Messages” from the left-hand sidebar menu.
3. If your messaging option is available, you will see the option to turn it on or off.

If the messaging option is not available, it means that Google has not reinstated the feature on your listing yet. In that case, you need to contact Google My Business support to ask them to fix the problem.

Here are some tips to help you optimize your messaging feature:

1. Respond promptly: Customers expect a quick response time, so make sure you check your messages regularly and respond promptly.
2. Provide accurate information: Make sure your messaging replies are accurate and provide the information your customers need. 
3. Add a personal touch: Personalize your messages to make a connection with your customers. 
4. Be professional: Keep your messages professional and courteous, as they represent your business.

In conclusion, communicating with your customers is vital to the success of your business. With the Google My Business messaging feature back in action, businesses can communicate more efficiently and engage better with their customers. As a business owner, make sure to check if your message feature is available and optimize it to provide the best customer experience possible.
