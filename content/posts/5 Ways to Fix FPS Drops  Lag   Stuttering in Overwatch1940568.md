Overwatch is one of the most popular games out there, but it's not without its problems. One of the most common issues that players face is FPS drops, which can be incredibly frustrating. Fortunately, there are several proven tips to help you boost your performance and say goodbye to those annoying FPS drops.

Tip #1: Close Unnecessary Programs

Running multiple programs at once can put a strain on your computer's resources, which can lead to FPS drops. Before starting Overwatch, make sure to close any unnecessary programs, such as web browsers, music players, or other games. This will help ensure that your computer has enough resources to run Overwatch smoothly.

Tip #4: Optimize Overwatch Settings

Overwatch has several settings that can be optimized to improve performance. First, make sure that Overwatch is running in full-screen mode, as this can help reduce FPS drops. Additionally, disable the "Reduce buffering" option, which can cause input lag and further reduce FPS. Finally, turn off the "Display Performance Stats" option, as this can also impact performance.

Tip #5: Upgrade Your Hardware

If you've tried all of these tips and are still experiencing FPS drops, it may be time to upgrade your computer's hardware. Upgrading your graphics card, CPU, or RAM can all help improve your performance in Overwatch.
