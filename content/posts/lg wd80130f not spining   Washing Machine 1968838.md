When your washing machine is refusing to spin, it could be caused by various reasons such as a faulty PCB or a damaged drive belt. However, before calling a technician to diagnose the issue, you can try one simple hack that may fix the problem instantly.

The one simple hack is to clean the drain filter. Over time, debris such as lint, coins, and other small items can accumulate in the drain filter, making it difficult for water to drain out of the washing machine. This, in turn, can prevent the machine from spinning. To fix this issue, you need to clean the drain filter.

Here's how to clean the drain filter on your LG WD80130F washing machine:

Step 1: Turn off the washing machine and unplug it from the power source.

Step 2: Locate the drain filter and remove the cover. The drain filter is usually located at the bottom left corner of the washing machine.

Step 3: Place a towel or a large container under the drain filter to catch any water that may spill out.

Step 4: Using a pair of pliers, unscrew the drain filter cap and remove it.

Step 5: Clean the drain filter by removing any debris that may have accumulated inside it.

Step 6: Once the drain filter is clean, reattach the drain filter cap and tighten it with the pliers.

Step 7: Replace the drain filter cover and plug in the washing machine.

Once you've completed these steps, run a cycle to see if your LG WD80130F washing machine is now spinning. If it is, then congratulations, you've fixed the issue! If it still refuses to spin, then you may need to call a technician to diagnose and repair the problem.

In conclusion, the LG WD80130F washing machine is a great appliance that can make laundry days a breeze. However, when it refuses to spin, it can be frustrating.
