# Discover the Secret Fix to Finally Silence Your Logitech G Pro X Popping Headset Noise on Your Windows 11/10 PC - No More Struggling in 2022!

Are you tired of struggling with that popping noise in your Logitech G Pro X headset while using it on your Windows 11/10 PC? Look no further, because we have a solution that will finally silence that annoying sound for good. 

First, let's understand what causes this problem. The popping sound is usually caused by the USB connection between the headset and the computer. It can happen due to a faulty cable, outdated drivers, or even electrical interference. 

Now that we know why this problem is occurring, let's move on to the solution. 

1. Use a Different USB Port

Sometimes, using a different USB port can solve the problem. Try plugging the headset into a different USB port and see if the popping noise persists. If it doesn't, then the USB port you were previously using may be faulty.

2. Update Your Drivers

Outdated drivers can also cause the popping noise in your Logitech G Pro X headset. Go to the Logitech website and download the latest drivers for your headset. Make sure to restart your computer after installing the new drivers to ensure they take effect.

3. Use a Ferrite Bead

If the above solutions don't work, try using a ferrite bead. A ferrite bead is a small device that attaches to the headset cable and helps reduce electromagnetic interference. They can be bought online or at electronic stores for a low cost.

4. Use a USB Hub

Finally, if none of the above solutions work, try using a USB hub. A USB hub will create a buffer between the headset and the computer, reducing the electrical interference that causes the popping noise.

In conclusion, the popping noise in your Logitech G Pro X headset on your Windows 11/10 PC can be fixed with the above solutions. Try them out and say goodbye to that annoying sound once and for all in 2022!

### Solution 3: Reinstall Logitech G HUB
 
You can quickly optimize and configure all of your supported Logitech G gear with the help of the Logitech G HUB software. However, there has been a recent update to this program, and this particular update is causing some of the major functionalities to malfunction. To see whether this is the case, try reinstalling the app:

### Solution 4: Check the connecting wires
 
Another possible cause of the popping noise in the Logitech headset is that there may be some difficulties with the connecting cables. In this instance, we recommend you thoroughly inspect the wires of the gaming headset to ensure that they are in good functioning order. If you locate any bending or damage in the wire, you must change it.
 
So, if there is an issue with the wire, you must go to the service facility to get it repaired.

### Solution 5: Update your sound drivers (Recommended)
 
As previously said, another possible reason for this sort of noise with the Logitech headset is running a faulty driver. If you haven’t updated the Logitech G Pro X driver for a long time, there’s a good chance you’ll hear a popping, crackling and other noises within the headset while connected to the PC.
 
So, updating the driver is a must thing to do. The manufacturer regularly releases compatible driver updates so potential issues with the headset can be easily resolved. To update the driver, follow the procedure outlined below:

Step 5: Right-click it and choose the Update Driver option.
 
Next, you must follow a set of on-screen instructions to complete the process. To be honest, manually updating drivers can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Plus, if done incorrectly can lead to a variety of PC problems, including abrupt system crashes.
 
Hence, we advise you to take the help of professional driver updater software like Advanced Driver Updater to batch install correct and compatible drivers in a few clicks. The application comes with a straightforward and intuitive dashboard to ease the overall experience of installing the latest driver updates. It also features backup and restores functionality to roll back to previous drivers in case of any mishap.

Step 3: You can either update the faulty sound drivers or simply click the Update All button to get the latest drivers for all the components at once.
