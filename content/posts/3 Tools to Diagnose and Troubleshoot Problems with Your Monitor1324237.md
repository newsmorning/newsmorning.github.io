# Is Your Monitor Acting Up? Try These 3 Tools To Fix It Like A Pro!

If you use a computer, there's no doubt that your computer's monitor is an essential component. Unfortunately, monitors can be prone to several issues that can ruin your experience. Whether it's flickering, poor color accuracy, or a resolution problem, these issues can be frustrating, especially for those who use their computer for work every day. If your monitor is acting up, don't worry, though. There are several tools available that can help you fix it like a pro.

## 1. Monitor Calibration Software

One of the most common problems with computer monitors is poor color accuracy. If the colors on your monitor look muted or washed out, you might need to calibrate your monitor. There are several monitor calibration software available that can help you adjust the color settings so that your screen displays colors more accurately. Some of the popular options include Calibrize, DisplayCAL, and SpyderX.

Display calibration software works by displaying various colors on your screen and comparing them to the standard color values. The software then adjusts the color settings on your monitor so that the displayed colors match the standard values. Once calibrated, you should notice a significant improvement in color accuracy.

## 2. Dead Pixel Tester

Dead pixels are another common issue that can ruin your computer's monitor experience. Dead pixels are those tiny dots on your screen that don't display any color at all. They can be distracting, especially when you're working on a white background. Fortunately, there's a way to detect and fix dead pixels using a dead pixel tester.

A dead pixel tester is a small software program that displays a rapidly changing color sequence on your screen. The changing colors help you identify dead pixels that aren't displaying any color. Once you identify the dead pixels, you can try to fix them using a dead pixel fixer tool. Some of the popular dead pixel testers include Dead Pixel Buddy and JScreenFix.

## 3. Display Driver Update

If your computer's monitor is behaving oddly, it's possible that the problem lies with the display driver. Display drivers are software programs that allow your computer to communicate with the monitor. If your display driver is outdated or corrupted, you might experience issues such as screen flickering or blurry text. To fix these issues, you need to update your display driver.

Updating your display driver is a simple process. You can either download the latest driver from the manufacturer's website or use a driver updater tool. Driver updater tools scan your computer for outdated drivers and automatically download and install the latest version. Some of the popular driver updater tools include Driver Booster, Snappy Driver Installer, and DriverPack Solution.

In conclusion, these are the three essential tools that can help you fix your computer's monitor like a pro. Whether it's poor color accuracy, dead pixels or problems with your display driver, these tools can help you identify and fix the problems. With these tools, you can ensure that your monitor always displays high-quality images and provides you with an optimal computing experience.

If the eyes are the windows to the soul, the
monitor has to be something similar for a computer, right? No matter how fancy
your graphics card or beautiful your customized operating system is, it won’t
mean anything if your monitor doesn’t do it justice.
 
The good news is that these days it’s pretty hard to find a monitor that’s outright trash, but there are plenty of people who use their computer display every day without realizing their full potential. 
 
The good news is that you can use a range of web-based applications to test and calibrate your display. Ensuring that you pick up and even fix any problems you may have. 
 

 
Because these are web-based it generally means they will work on anything with a browser! To get you started, these three tools will cover most bases when it comes to common monitor issues.
 
## Blur Busters
 
Blur Busters is all about assessing the motion handling abilities of your displays. The refresh rate abilities of flat panels displays has been improving in leaps and bounds. Just about every monitor supports at least 60Hz these days and many monitors now support much higher rates such as 122Hz, 144Hz and more!
 
As their name suggests, Blur Busters provides a number of tests at their “testufo” website that are designed to reveal how much motion blur a given monitor has. 
 
These tests can help you find the sweet spot for your monitor’s settings to minimize unwanted blur. It also provides an easy way to test a monitor before you buy it, as long as the system has an internet connection.
 
If you want to professionally assess displays
using this site, they’ve even invented a (relatively) inexpensive pursuit
camera system that can capture motion artifacts with accuracy comparable to
manufacturer systems.
 
## Dead Pixel Buddy
 
Your LCD screen consists of millions of microscopic pixels made from sub-pixels that reflect the primary colors used to mix every other color. The factories these are made in have to be incredibly clean and the process precisely controlled. 
 
A single spec of dust or small glitch in the manufacturing process can break individual pixels or sub-pixels. This then shows up as pixels that are “stuck” on the same color or simply dead and dark.
 
In the old days this was a real problem, even on high-end monitors. The number of broken pixels that manufacturers saw as acceptable  in the early days if LCD monitors would be shocking by modern standards. These days we have yet to encounter a new monitor that has any dead pixels, but it does still happen. 
 
Different manufacturers have different policies on product returns for dead pixels, so make sure you know yours. It’s best to test a new monitor immediately because often you can exchange it for any reason within the first few days.
 
To check for dead or stuck pixels, all you need is Dead Pixel Buddy. A simple yet brilliant web app that lets you quickly access a range of full-screen colors designed to reveal the various types of broken pixels a display can have. It should be your first stop if you suspect a dead pixel or want to screen a new monitor.
 
## Eizo Monitor Test
 
While Blur Busters and Dead Pixel Buddy are great, they have a very narrow set of applications. For a comprehensive set of general monitor testing tools, you need look no further than Eizo Monitor Test.
 
Eizo are themselves a maker of professional
monitors, such as the ColorEdge range featuring built-in color calibration
sensors. Luckily you don’t need to own one of their monitors to make use of
this excellent set of free monitor tests.
 
Each comes with a simple explanation of what
you should be seeing and how to adjust things to make it look right. This sort
of suite used to cost a chunk of change back in the day, now it’s just a click
away.
 
## I Can See Clearly Now
 
Armed with just these three web addresses, you
are now equipped to quickly figure out what’s wrong with this picture. Or any
picture if we’re being honest. Never again will your poor eyes have to suffer
the indignity of a subpar monitor image.
