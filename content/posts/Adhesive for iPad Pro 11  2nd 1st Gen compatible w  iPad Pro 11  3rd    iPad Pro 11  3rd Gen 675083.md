Revolutionize Your iPad Pro 11 Experience with this New Adhesive that's Compatible with 2nd and 1st Gen, and Even Better with the 3rd Gen! Say Goodbye to Slipping and Hello to Easy Handling!

The iPad Pro 11 is one of the best tablets in the market today, and it's known for its innovative design, superior display, and powerful performance. However, one common issue that many users face with this device is slippery handling. Whether you're using it for work or entertainment, a slippery iPad Pro 11 can be frustrating and potentially dangerous.

Luckily, there's a new adhesive solution that's designed to revolutionize your iPad Pro 11 experience. This innovative adhesive is compatible with 2nd and 1st gen iPads, but works even better with the latest 3rd gen iPad Pro 11. It's the ultimate solution to a slippery iPad, and it's easy to apply, leaving no residue behind.

The adhesive is made from advanced materials that provide a strong and durable grip, ensuring your iPad stays in place. You won't have to worry about your tablet shifting or sliding around while you're using it anymore. This will help you take your productivity to the next level, as well as make entertainment experiences more immersive.

The adhesive is also ultra-thin and does not add any bulk to your device, ensuring that your iPad maintains its elegant and sleek look. You can use your iPad with confidence knowing that it's secure while maintaining its design aesthetics.

Another benefit of this new adhesive is that it can help reduce the risk of damage from drops and accidents. When an iPad is slipping, it's more likely to hit the ground or other hard surfaces, resulting in a cracked screen or other damages. With the new adhesive, your iPad will maintain a secure grip, reducing the risk of damage and potentially saving you from costly repair bills.

In conclusion, if you're tired of your iPad Pro 11 slipping and sliding around, then you'll want to try this new adhesive solution. It's easy to apply, compatible with 2nd and 1st gen iPads, and even better for the latest 3rd gen model. Say goodbye to slippery handling and hello to easy handling with this innovative new adhesive solution.

## Chosen Solution
 I can't find adhesive for the iPad Pro 11" 3rd generation anywhere. I would like to know from an expert if the iPad Pro 1st/2nd gen's adhesive ALSO works with the iPad Pro 11" 3rd generation. If not, are there any alternatives for adhesive that is just as trustworthy?

 There are some minor discrepancies between the two, so it is definitely not an identical match. You may be able to adapt one to the other since the housing is the same overall footprint. But some of the ledges on the inside do not match exactly.
I did find adhesive for the third gen at Mobilesentrix, but they only sell to businesses, and it comes in a ten pack. So that may not suit your specific needs. Otherwise you can use Tesa tape, but you'll need to cut it yourself. Which is quite a bit more time consuming, and the seals will not be as precise.
