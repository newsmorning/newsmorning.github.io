Introduction:

The Nokia Lumia 520 was a popular device that many people have come to love due to its sleek design and high-quality features. However, when it comes to replacing the touch digitizer, things can quickly become a disaster. In this article, we will show you how to fix your Nokia Lumia 520 touchscreen disaster after replacing a new touch digitizer.

Step 1: Power Down Your Nokia Lumia 520

The first thing you may want to do is power down your device. This will allow you to work on the phone without accidentally touching anything on the screen. It will also prevent anything from accidentally popping up and disrupting your work.

Step 2: Reapply the Adhesive

When replacing the touch digitizer, you will need to remove the adhesive tape that holds the glass onto the phone. After applying the tape, you will need to reapply the adhesive tape. This will help to keep the glass in place and prevent it from moving when you use it.

Step 3: Check Your Phone's Touch Settings

Next, you will want to check your phone's touch settings. Make sure that the touch settings are calibrated correctly. You will need to recalibrate these settings after replacing the touch digitizer.

Step 4: Remove Any Air Bubbles

When replacing the touch digitizer, it is essential to ensure that there are no air bubbles underneath the glass. These bubbles can cause the touch screen to become unresponsive or not work correctly. To fix this issue, use a credit card or any other flat object to push or smooth out any air bubbles present.

Step 5: Test the Touch Screen Digitizer

After replacing the touch digitizer, you will want to test the touch screen to ensure it works correctly. You can do this by simply tapping different areas of your device's screen. If the screen responds appropriately, then you have done everything correctly.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, replacing the touch digitizer on your Nokia Lumia 520 can be a straightforward process as long as you know what you are doing. By following the tips outlined in this article, you can fix any issues that may arise. Remember, be patient, take your time, and pay attention to detail, and you will succeed.

## Chosen Solution
 i have replaced my broken touch digitizer with new one but now my phone hangs frequently is any kind of software problems or what.......plzz help me.

 Is there a particular sequence and or quickness involved in the battery removal and replacement method of getting the touch screen to respond again?

 Make sure that there are not any software updates available for the device. You might also want to do a reset on it - but then you'll lose all of your pics and stuff.

 I also had to change the display on two phones, and I have the same problem, constantly blocked, I made the updates and I've done a hard reset, and all recommendations also tried overriding the proximity sensor, I think that changing the screen there is something in the connections that have to be considered and that is not listed anywhere.
Just need to take it for service, please anyone can provide a solution, thank you very much.

 its the software/firmware....
amber and cyan only work with genuine original digitizers
only option is to downgrade but just make sure you have all the files and correct rom :)

 I have the same problem.
Already tried many Roms but still haven't found one that works.
I download roms with navifirm
How do I know wich roms are amber or cyan?
EDIT: Forgot to mention that the touchscreen works some times after trying to make a hard reset or after missing the timing to put the software flashing touchscreen works fine, until I reboot the phone, so this is very strange behavior...

 I got my lumia 520 touch sensor replaced. Now when I start the phone, the touch works fine until I turn the phone off and restart it. Upon restarting, the touch doesn't work and I have to remove the battery and put it back again a few times before it starts working again. But once the phone turns on and the touch is working, it poses no problems until the next reboot (no matter how long the time duration is). Is there any phone update expected to fix this? (My phone has got the latest OS update.)

 Replaced my 520 Nokia screen and my phone now sticks and stalls on pages and my keyboard keys are a little off , wrong letters selection of some kind , start screen stalling not rolling up to put pin in properly like my phone has a mind of its own â€¼ .

 Its really the problem with the touch screen nothing else try to find a better touch screen if it still don't work then update you firmware if it still don't work take it to the nearest service providers

 Has anyone being  able to get a solution to this problem? i tried something different and for 2 days now my 1520 has been working fine.
