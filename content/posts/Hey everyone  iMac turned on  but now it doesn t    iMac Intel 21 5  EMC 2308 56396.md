# Imac Horror Story: The Terrifying Moment My Intel 21.5 Emc 2308 Suddenly Shut Off And Refused To Turn Back On!

It was a normal day, and everything was going smoothly until my iMac suddenly shut off. I was in the middle of an important project when my computer screen went black. At first, I thought it was just a power outage in my area, but when I looked around, I realized that everything else was working fine. That's when I realized I might be in trouble.

I tried turning on my iMac, but it wouldn't respond. My heart dropped as I realized that something was seriously wrong. I tried every trick in the book. I unplugged it and plugged it back in, I reset the SMC, I pressed and held the power button, but nothing worked. My iMac was dead, and I was terrified.

As someone who relies on technology for work, this was a nightmare scenario. My mind raced as I thought of all the files and projects that I had saved on that computer. I didn't have a backup, and I couldn't access my files. The thought of losing everything was overwhelming.

I knew I had to get to the bottom of this, so I took my iMac to a technician. They opened it up, and what they found was shocking. The insides of my iMac were filled with dust, and the fans were clogged. It was so bad that it had caused my computer to overheat, leading to irreversible damage.

Looking back, I realize that I had been neglecting my iMac's maintenance. I hadn't cleaned the fans in years, and I had never thought about the damage that dust could do. But it was a harsh lesson to learn. A simple cleaning could have saved me from this nightmare. 

The technician fixed my iMac, but it was a costly repair. I learned my lesson and made sure to keep my computer clean and up-to-date with the latest operating systems. But, the fear of losing everything was ingrained in my mind, and it's a lesson that I won't forget. 

In conclusion, neglecting your computer's maintenance can lead to catastrophic consequences. Don't wait until it's too late to clean your computer's fans and protect your files with a backup. Take it from me, the cost of repairing a damaged computer is much more than the cost of regular maintenance. Keep your computer healthy, and it will reward you with years of reliable service.


## Chosen Solution
 Hey everyone, my iMac turned on but when i accidentaly touched it while it was plugged in but powered I got struck and now it doesn’t turn on. Can anyone help me identify whats causing the problem. Also I can see that green LED is on.

this is what looks suspicious to me

 The solder joints are fine in your picture. I would focus in on the power supply after you have tested the outlets!
A surge or lightning strike could have damaged your power supply are you using a surge suppressor or better yet a UPS? I often find power supplies get damaged from bad outlet and building ground circuits.
Looking down on the righthand side of the logic board you should spy a strip of black tape as seen here

Reading from right to left what LED are on when you plug in the iMac and then press the power switch?

LED Functions
LED #1 - Indicates that trickle voltage from power supply has been detected by logic board. This LED will remain ON whenever the iMac is connected to a working AC power source. The LED will remain on even when computer has been shut down or put to sleep. The LED will turn off only if AC power source is disconnected or power supply is faulty.
LED #2 - Indicates that logic board has detected power from power supply when computer is turned on. This LED will be ON when computer is turned on and power supply and voltage regulators are working correctly.
LED #3 - Indicates that computer and video card are communicating. This LED will be ON when computer is communicating properly with video card. If LEDs 1 and 2 are ON and you heard the startup sound, but LED 3 is OFF, then video card might be installed incorrectly or need replacement. Note: LED #3 is not present on models with integrated graphics.
LED #4 - Indicates that computer and LCD panel are communicating. This LED will be ON when computer is turned on and video signal is being generated. If LED 4 is ON and there is no image on display, then LCD panel, LED backlight board, or cables between might be installed incorrectly or need replacement.
