# UNBOXING THE GAME-CHANGER: Infinix Note 7's First Impressions Will Leave You Breathlessü§Ø

Infinix Mobility, the premium smartphone manufacturers, recently launched their latest smartphone, the Infinix Note 7. The phone has been making waves in the market for its amazing features and breathtaking design. As a writer, I had the opportunity to unbox the phone and experience its features firsthand. And to say the least, the experience was nothing short of amazing.

## CONTENTS OF THE BOX

The Infinix Note 7 comes packed in a sleek, bright yellow box that immediately catches your attention. Opening the box reveals the following items:

- The Infinix Note 7 phone
- A clear phone case
- A power adapter
- A charging cable
- A pair of earphones
- A warranty card
- A user manual

## THE DESIGN

The Infinix Note 7 is not called a game-changer for nothing. From the moment you lay your eyes on the phone, you can tell that it's something special. The phone boasts of a massive 6.95-inch display with a punch-hole design that houses the front camera. The phone's front and back are made of glass, while the frame is made of plastic. The phone's design is sleek and modern, making it a perfect fit for every user. 

Apart from the punch-hole design, the phone's back also features a circular module that houses the quad-camera setup, a flash, and the Infinix logo. The back of the Infinix Note 7 is as beautiful as it is functional. The phone has been designed for ergonomics, which makes it comfortable to hold for long periods.

## CAMERA

The Infinix Note 7 features a quad-camera setup that comprises four cameras: a primary 48MP sensor, a 2MP macro lens, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP dedicated video camera. The front-facing camera is a 16MP sensor that delivers great selfies. The camera app comes with plenty of features and modes that enhance the user experience. 

The Infinix Note 7's camera is exceptional, and it delivers great pictures, even in low-light conditions. The camera's focus is fast and accurate, and the pictures captured are sharp and detailed. The quad-camera setup provides plenty of versatility to take pictures of different types, including wide-angle, macro, and portrait shots.

## PERFORMANCE

The Infinix Note 7 is equipped with an octa-core processor that combines two Cortex-A75 cores with six Cortex-A55 cores, clocked at 2.0GHz. The phone's processor is paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The phone runs on Android 10 with Infinix's XOS 6.0 skin. 

The phone's performance is impressive, and it runs smoothly without any lags or hiccups. The phone's RAM management is also great, and it can run multiple apps simultaneously without any issues. The phone's gaming capabilities are not lacking either, and it can handle even heavy games without any problems.

## BATTERY LIFE

The Infinix Note 7 comes with a massive 5,000mAh battery that can easily last for an entire day. The phone also supports fast charging, which means that it can be charged up to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone's battery life is exceptional, and it will make sure that you don't run out of battery, no matter what you're doing.

## CONCLUSION

The Infinix Note 7 is a game-changer in the world of smartphones. The phone's design, camera, performance, and battery life make it a great choice for anyone in the market for a new phone. The phone is priced reasonably and delivers on every front. I would definitely recommend the Infinix Note 7 to anyone who wants a premium phone at an affordable price.


The Infinix Note 7 touched based at Dignited HQ over a week ago. It‚Äôs around that time we do our ritual unboxing and first impressions to whet your appetite with the promise of more to come. Seatbelts, please. Lean back and enjoy the ride.
 
First off, kudos are in order for Infinix Mobility for keeping the price of their annual Infinix Note iterations roughly under $200 year on year. I know of a few phone manufacturers that get carried away by the popularity of their devices to quote us ridiculous sums for their later releases.
 
The thing about the Note series is that each new version is a little bit like Bertie Bott‚Äôs Every Flavour Beans for those who you know their¬† Harry Potter lore. Other than a familial family resemblance and the XOS skin, the Note versions don‚Äôt know each other since Adam. Case in point, the Infinix Note 5 runs Android One, the Note 6 has the Stylus pen and an AMOLED screen, while the Note 7‚Ä¶well, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here to find out.

## Look and Feel
 
Truth be told, the Infinix Note 7 is indeed a phablet, by which I mean a beefy device that straddles the size of a smartphone and a tablet. Weighing in at 206 grams and 6.95 inches, the Note 7 is a tall chunky device compared to its predecessors. I do have rather large man-sized hands but I still can‚Äôt wrap my hand around the device.¬†
 
The advertised ‚ÄòAether Black‚Äô color of the piece is in truth a shade of black and green. Not that we are complaining. Most of the devices I review come in black. I am not one to beef on a colorful device. 
 
The box is gift-wrapped with the usual suspects. The fast charger will be your new best friend going forward. I love the addition of a screen protector and the jacket. My last review device didn‚Äôt have those and I have never been able to purchase them ever since. The earphones are generic and lifeless but as long as Infinix keeps the device prices low, I don‚Äôt mind this oversight in the least.

## A camera to die for
 
Probably the wow factor in the Infinix Note 7 is the camera setup. I am no professional photographer, but I just can‚Äôt seem to get enough of those Instagram worthy shots and TikTok videos. All things considered, the camera just keeps you coming. It‚Äôs uncanny how good the shots get. 
 
The Note 7 brings the heat with its 48MP Quad AI rear camera supported by a decent 16MP AI punch-hole front camera. Take this from me, this ensemble will convert you into your own overnight paparazzi.¬†More on this later.
 
## Side-mounted fingerprint scanner
 
Oh no! Left-handed Infinix fans won‚Äôt be amused with the right-hand controls on this device.  We tried it out though and it‚Äôs not so bad. Unlike the rear/front fingerprint scanner, the side-mounted scanner is made for the right-hand thumb. Let‚Äôs not even pretend on this one. 
 
The left side of the device houses the SIM card tray and that‚Äôs it. Infinix made the decision to cram the power button (doubles as a power button) and the volume keys on the right side. 
 
## Not Micro-USB again!
 
I don‚Äôt know about you, but it was my understanding that USB-C had taken over. Infinix clearly didn‚Äôt buy into this because the Note 7 still plugs into the dated Micro-USB connector. 
 
Matter of fact, the entire bottom setup of the Infinix devices has remained largely the same over the years. You get yourself an audio jack, microphone hole, Micro-USB port and speaker. 
 
## Price and Where to Buy
 
The Infinix Note 7 retails for UGX 725,000 ($195) for 64GB variant, and UGX 825,000 ($221) for the 128GB variant in Uganda. Prices might vary depending on the region. Get yourself a piece at any Infinix branded offline store, or on Jumia online. Airtel Uganda in conjunction with Infinix Uganda has the Note 7 on sale loaded with 5G data to sweeten the deal.
