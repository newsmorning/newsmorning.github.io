- Check HDMI cablesCheck for firmware updatesAdjust your audio settings

 
Below, we will discuss some relatively simple fixes you can attempt to rectify a lip sync issue on your Toshiba TV. Keep reading to discover more about this common issue and how to fix it!
 
## How Do I Fix Lip Sync Issues on My Toshiba TV?
 
In the digital age, television viewers are more aware of the quality of their viewing experiences than ever. From picture resolution to smooth audio and video, people are paying much closer attention to the details.
 
Timely lip sync is an important element in TV watching, as it helps maintain continuity between the visual and audio elements. If a TV’s lip sync is not calibrated correctly, it can ruin the viewing experience by making it seem like actors are out of time with their words.
 
If the lip sync on your Toshiba TV is not working correctly, there are a few things you can try to fix it. You may need to reconnect certain HDMI cables, update your firmware, or adjust your audio settings.
 
Below, we will discuss how you can employ these three fixes to solve this problem once and for all.
 
### Check HDMI Cables
 
HDMI cables are often used to connect your TV to streaming sticks, soundbars, and speakers. Depending on what the cables are connected to, they may carry audio or video to or from your TV.
 
Some TVs will have lip sync problems if there is a bad connection between the two devices. Try reconnecting the HDMI cable to fix a loose connection, or replace your HDMI cable if you suspect yours is damaged.
 
It is also important to ensure you are using a good quality HDMI cable. Avoid any frayed, bent, or poor quality cables, as these can put unnecessary strain on your system and cause lip sync issues to occur more frequently.
 
### Check for Firmware Updates
 
Another reason your TV may be experiencing lip sync problems is outdated firmware. Firmware is an internal software program that runs on the TV and keeps it working properly.
 
Firmware updates often include new features and fix glitches, some of which may be causing lip sync issues. If your TV has a lip sync problem and you have an older firmware version running, update it as soon as possible by following these steps:
 
- Press the menu button on your remote control.Select “Settings,” then “System.”Select “Software Upgrade.”If there is an available update, press “Update Now.”

 
Once the update finishes installing, try watching something to see if you are still experiencing lip sync problems.
 
### Adjust Your Audio Settings
 
To get the most accurate lip sync possible, you must adjust your audio settings accordingly. Generally, it’s best to keep the audio on your TV as low as possible to prevent distortion.
 
Not only will this heighten the quality of the sound, but it will also decrease the chances of lip sync errors.
 
Another thing you can do is adjust the pitch and speed of your audio track so it matches the pitch and speed of the audio playing through your TV speakers.
 
Pitch refers to how high or low the sound is in relation to normal speech. By default, the audio and video tracks of your Toshiba TV are synced at a standard rate of 60 fps.
 
You can adjust the speed or pitch to suit your requirements by selecting from the available options on the settings menu. To change your settings, follow these steps:
 
- Press the menu button on your remote control.Select “Settings,” then “Sound.”Adjust the pitch and speed to your desired rate.

 
Adjusting these settings will increase or decrease your TV’s perceptual processing speed, making the internal components operate more smoothly. In some cases, this can fix the lip sync issues that many users experience.
 
## In Conclusion
 
Lip sync issues on your Toshiba TV can diminish the quality of your overall viewing experience. Luckily, there are several things you can do to attempt to fix it.
 
Check that all HDMI cables you are using and plugged in correctly and not bent or damaged. If that does not solve the problem, check for firmware updates on your TV and install them if available. If all else fails, adjust the audio settings on your television.
 
In most cases, one of these three techniques will fix the lip sync problem on your TV. If you still have trouble, contact Toshiba customer support for more assistance.
