Title: You Won't Believe What Little Nightmares 2 Reveals About Creepy Duo Six and Mono at Gamescom 2019 Trailer!

Introduction:
Little Nightmares 2 is the sequel to the widely popular game Little Nightmares. Fans of puzzle-platforming games were excited to see the new revelations about the creepy duo, Six and Mono in the Gamescom 2019 trailer. In this article, we will dive deeper into the secrets uncovered about these two fascinating characters.

Body:
The Little Nightmares 2 trailer starts with a glimpse of Mono, the new protagonist, and Six, the character from the first game. Six is hiding in a lone building in a forest, and Mono explores the suspicious landscape. The intriguing factor is that Six now has a bag covering her head, which was not present in the first game.

As the trailer continues, Mono and Six encounter the dark and twisted world outside the forest. In a few glimpses, we see that Mono is using an axe as his primary weapon, while Six seems to be guiding him through the world. We get to see some of the new puzzles, like using a light to scare off monsters, and the game's challenging but fantastic-looking platforming.

The most interesting part of the trailer was undoubtedly the introduction of a new character who appears to be a deformed version of Six. This new character adds to the game's creepiness factor and makes us wonder what her relation to Six is. She seems to be wearing the same outfit and has a similar face to Six, but with a few deformities.

Conclusion:
Overall, the Little Nightmares 2 trailer revealed exciting new aspects of the game's plot and characters. With the addition of a new protagonist, Mono, and a deformed version of Six, players will be intrigued to learn more about how these two characters are related. The trailer also shows the new puzzles and platforming elements in the game, which will undoubtedly excite fans of the first game. Little Nightmares 2 is a game that promises to be just as enthralling and creepy as its predecessor, and we can't wait to see what the game has in store for us.
