Title: You Won’t Believe This Genius Hack for Removing Pesky Stripped Backplate Screws on Your Nintendo Switch!

If you are a proud Nintendo Switch owner, you know how frustrating it can be to encounter stripped backplate screws. These tiny screws are vital in keeping the backplate of your device in place, but they also tend to give the most grief in terms of removal. Fear not, though, as we have a genius hack that will solve this problem in a snap!

Before we show you this ultimate hack, let's understand the problem better. How do these screws get stripped in the first place? Well, it could be due to regular wear and tear, excessive force while tightening or loosening, or using the wrong tool. Regardless of how it happened, the outcome is always the same - a stripped screw that refuses to budge. Worse, it can damage the screw head or strip the threading, making it nearly impossible to remove.

So, if you are struggling to remove stripped backplate screws, here's what you need to do:

Step 1: Get the right tool

Firstly, you should get the right tool for the job. You don't need to rush out and buy anything new or fancy - all you need is a simple rubber band. That's right, a rubber band can be the solution to all your problems when it comes to stripped screws!

Step 2: Place the rubber band over the screw

Now that you have the rubber band, stretch it out and place it over the top of the stripped screw. Make sure the rubber band covers the entire head of the screw.

Step 3: Twist slowly

Using your screwdriver, gently insert it into the screwhead through the rubber band. Now apply slow and steady pressure to turn the screwdriver to loosen the screw. The rubber band fills the gaps and provides enough traction to grip the screwhead.

Step 4: Success!

As you turn the screwdriver, don't be surprised if the screw comes out effortlessly. That's right - with the right tool and technique, removing stripped backplate screws is simple and uneventful.

In conclusion, losing your cool over stripped screws is a thing of the past. With this simple hack, you can now remove stripped backplate screws on your Nintendo Switch without breaking a sweat. Remember to keep your cool, use the rubber band, and turn the screwdriver slowly, and you'll be good to go.

So the next time you encounter a pesky stripped screw, remember this hack and show it who's boss! Happy gaming, and enjoy your Nintendo Switch without worrying about stripped screws.


## Chosen Solution
 So I had a new Backplate for christmas and was happy to finally replace old plate because of all the scratches, but when I was removing the screws I accidentally stripped 3... Do you guys have any ideas on how to remove those 3 stripped screws?

 Haven’t done this yet, but my father, whose job was fixing motherboards and other electronical parts, said that the only way is to drill where the screw is, with a drill head as big as the screw itself :/

 One thing that’s worked really well for me in the past is to put a flat rubber band between the screw and the screwdriver and PUSH — the pressure and added tackiness of the rubberband will allow for the screwdriver to have a better “grip” and get those out.
Also, you’re not alone. Those OEM Switch screws are EASY to strip.
