Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When You Turn On Your iPhone 7 Plus - The Shocking Reason Why Your Home Button Heats Up in Seconds!

If you own an iPhone 7 Plus, you may have noticed that the home button gets hot in seconds after you turn it on. This is not a normal occurrence and could be a sign of a faulty device. In this article, we will take a look at the reasons why this happens and what you can do about it.

The iPhone 7 Plus has a unique home button, which is not actually a button at all. It uses haptic feedback to give the user the sensation of pressing on a button. This means that there is no physical button to push, and the feeling of pressing the button is created by the phone's vibration engine.

One reason why the home button may heat up in seconds is due to a malfunction in the vibration engine. When the engine is not functioning properly, it can cause excessive heat to be generated, which can lead to the home button heating up quickly. This can be dangerous as prolonged exposure to excessive heat can cause damage to the device or even cause it to catch fire.

Another possible reason for the home button heating up is due to a software issue. If your iPhone is running an outdated or malfunctioning version of iOS, it can cause the phone's processor to work overtime, generating excessive heat. This can cause the home button to heat up and may also cause the phone to run slowly and perform poorly.

So, what can you do if your iPhone 7 Plus home button heats up in seconds after turning it on? Firstly, you should stop using the device immediately to prevent further damage. Secondly, you should take your device to an authorized dealer or Apple service center to have it checked and repaired. They will be able to diagnose the issue and fix it for you.

In conclusion, the iPhone 7 Plus home button heating up in seconds after turning it on is not a normal occurrence and could indicate a problem with the device. It is important to stop using the device immediately and take it to an authorized dealer or Apple service center for repair. Remember that prolonged exposure to excessive heat can cause damage to your device, and in extreme cases, it can even cause it to catch fire. So, don't take any chances and get your device checked if you experience this issue.

## Chosen Solution
 Just replaced the screen (home button would never heat up prior to screen replacement)
the bracket thingy that has four screws is screwed in (bar the last screw on the far right i lost that one)   could that single screw missing be why the home button is getting so hot?

 The screw missing for the right hand side of the home button bracket isnâ€™t why the home button is getting hot.
The home button is damaged in some kind of way most likely when it was transferred from the old cracked screen to the replacement screen (basically a short circuit from the home button causing it to become very hot).
Try putting the home button on the old screen and see if the issue persists on there if the screen still functions.
