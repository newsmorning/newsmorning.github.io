# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Fix Your Toyota Corolla's Rear Seat Hinges in 6 Simple Steps!

If you own a Toyota Corolla, it's likely that you've experienced a problem with the rear seat hinges. Over time, these hinges can become loose or even break under normal wear and tear. This can be frustrating, as it can make it difficult to fold down the rear seats and access the trunk. However, fixing your Toyota Corolla's rear seat hinges is surprisingly easy and can be accomplished in just six simple steps.

Before you get started, you'll need a few tools. Make sure you have a socket set, a wrench, some pliers, and possibly a screwdriver on hand.

Step 1: Remove the Rear Seat Cushion

The first step is to remove the rear seat cushion. This is the part of the seat that you sit on, and it should be relatively easy to remove. Look for two clips at the front of the seat cushion, and then lift it up and out of the car.

Step 2: Remove the Bolts

Next, you'll need to remove the bolts that hold the hinge in place. There should be two bolts on each side of the hinge, and you'll need to use your socket set and wrench to remove them.

Step 3: Remove the Hinge

With the bolts removed, you can now remove the hinge itself. Use your pliers to pull it free from the car, being careful not to damage the surrounding trim or upholstery.

Step 4: Replace the Hinge

Now that you have the old hinge removed, it's time to replace it with a new one. You can order a replacement hinge from your local Toyota dealership, or buy one online. Simply position the new hinge in place, and secure it with the bolts you removed earlier.

Step 5: Reattach the Rear Seat Cushion

With the new hinge in place, you can now reattach the rear seat cushion. It should snap back into place just as easily as it came out.

Step 6: Test the Hinge

Once the seat cushion is back in place, test the hinge to make sure it's working properly. Fold the seat down and back up again, and check to see that the hinge is now secure and stable.

By following these six simple steps, you can easily fix your Toyota Corolla's rear seat hinges and get back to using your car as you normally would. No more wrestling with the rear seat or struggling to access the trunk. With just a few basic tools and some patience, you can have your Corolla back to its full functionality in no time.

## Introduction
 
This guide details how to properly remove the rear-outside seat hinges, but can also be applied to the removal of the rear-inside seat hinges, as the removal process is almost identical. Although this repair is made on a 2014 Toyota Corolla, it also applies to all 2012-2017 models of the Toyota Corolla as they are in the same generation.
