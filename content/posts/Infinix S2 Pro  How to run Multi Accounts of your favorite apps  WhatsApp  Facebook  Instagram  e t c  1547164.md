Revolutionize Your Social Media Life with Infinix S2 Pro: Unlock the Secret to Running Multiple Accounts of Your Favorite Apps Simultaneously!

Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. It is the primary source of communication, entertainment, and information for millions of people worldwide. Whether it's Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, social media platforms offer endless possibilities to connect with people across the globe. However, as social media has grown, so has the problem of managing multiple accounts on various platforms. But, what if you had a phone that could help you run multiple accounts of your favorite apps simultaneously?

Introducing the Infinix S2 Pro – a smartphone designed to revolutionize your social media life. With its innovative features, the Infinix S2 Pro offers a seamless experience when managing multiple social media accounts. Running multiple accounts was once a tedious task that required users to switch between different applications repeatedly. This is where the Infinix S2 Pro comes in to change the game. The Infinix S2 Pro comes equipped with a feature called 'App Twin' that allows users to clone applications and use two different accounts at the same time.

The 'App Twin' feature on the Infinix S2 Pro enables users to run multiple versions of the same app, allowing them to log in and use two different accounts at the same time. This feature comes in handy especially for those who have multiple social media accounts, such as one for personal use and another for business. The Infinix S2 Pro allows users to enjoy the best of both worlds without the need to create different accounts for each.

With the Infinix S2 Pro, you can clone and use multiple accounts of apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and more. This feature eliminates the need to log in and out of accounts repeatedly, saving time and making social media management a breeze. It also enables users to separate their personal and business accounts, which helps in maintaining the privacy of both.

Apart from the 'App Twin' feature, the Infinix S2 Pro also offers an impressive camera experience. The device comes equipped with a dual front camera, including a 13MP primary sensor and an 8MP wide-angle sensor. The front camera's wide-angle lens enables users to capture more in a single frame, making it perfect for group selfies.

The Infinix S2 Pro is powered by a 1.3GHz octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, providing users with a smooth and lag-free experience. The device runs on the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system and has a storage capacity of 32GB, which is expandable up to 128GB with a microSD card.

In conclusion, the Infinix S2 Pro is the perfect smartphone if you're looking for a device that can revolutionize your social media life. Its 'App Twin' feature allows you to run multiple accounts of your favorite apps simultaneously, while its dual front camera ensures that you capture perfect selfies every time. If you're looking for a smartphone that offers a seamless social media management experience, look no further than the Infinix S2 Pro.

When it comes to the Infinix S2 Pro, numbers don’t lie. If our Infinix traffic is any indicator, this smartphone torpedoed onto the local smartphone market and continues to gain traction. We have reviewed the S2 Pro at length and we loved what we saw. Especially Multi Account. Here’s why:
 
Infinix’s S2 Pro’s nifty baked-in app supports seamlessly logging into multiple accounts on the same device. Aptly named the Multi Account, usage is simultaneous and as beautifully seamless as it gets.
 
The apps and subsequent notifications are labeled with an infinity sign to distinguish them from the regular apps. Performance is butter smooth. There’s no lag whatsoever, no abnormal surge in RAM usage, none of that.  The closest non-S2 Pro users can get to such a feature is via third-party apps such as Parallel Space.
 
Apart from Parallel Space and a few others floating about the Play Store, Telegram is the only app we know that supports Multiple Accounts off the bat. You can connect up to 3 separate accounts with different phone numbers with Telegram. Rather neat, if you ask me.
 
The only other device we have reviewed having a similar feature is the Lenovo K3 Note. Lenovo K3’s Note Secure Zone feature lets you run multiple simultaneous Accounts of any App. That’s about where the similarities end.
 
From what we can tell, the execution of this feature is very different. The Lenovo K3 Note actually carves out a separate space in your phone (the Secure Zone). Doing so sacrifices overall performance and is quite RAM intensive. Not even the 2GB of RAM can fully cover this spike. Multi Account on the S2 Pro, on the other hand, runs just like any other system app. It’s optimised for stability and performance.
 
## How to Use Multiple Account on Infinix S2 Pro
 
If you are still using your S2 Pro from its factory state, Multi Account will be under ‘Tools’. However, you can just as easily search for it. A window, as shown above, will welcome you to Multi Account. Go ahead and add any number of apps you wish to have another account of. By default, WhatsApp is the only one added for obvious 1 billion+ reasons.
 
You will have to log in afresh to your accounts in Multi Account, thereby creating new accounts. An interesting thing we realised was that given that Telegram already allows you up to 3 accounts, we could log into 6 separate accounts and run them all on one device.
 
How cool is that! Notifications come the usual way, only tagged ‘Multi Account’ to distinguish them from those from other apps. This app is remarkably stable and surprisingly light for what it does. Way to go, Infinix!
