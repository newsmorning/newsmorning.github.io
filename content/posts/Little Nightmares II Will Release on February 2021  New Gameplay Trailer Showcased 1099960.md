For those who don't know, Little Nightmares is a puzzle-platform horror game developed by Tarsier Studios and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game is set in a surreal world that feels like a bad dream. The main goal of the game is to help a little girl named Six escape from the Maw - a massive underwater vessel that's inhabited by grotesque creatures.

The game's unique art style and haunting gameplay made it an instant success when it was released in 2017. Fans have been eagerly waiting for a sequel ever since, and now, we finally have what we've been asking for.

Little Nightmares II follows the story of a new character named Mono, a young boy trapped in a distorted world ruled by a sadistic teacher named the "Hunter." Along the way, Mono meets Six, the protagonist from the first game, and the two must work together to escape the Hunter's clutches.

The recently released gameplay trailer for Little Nightmares II showcases the game's exquisite graphics and bone-chilling ambience. The game is set to be even more unsettling than its predecessor, with new and terrifying monsters to avoid and puzzles to solve. The trailer features scenes of Mono sneaking past disturbing creatures, such as a deformed, axe-wielding teddy bear and a towering, dark figure.

The trailer also gives us a glimpse of the game's various gameplay mechanics, such as traps and environmental puzzles that add to the game's tension. Along the way, Mono and Six will navigate through forests, dilapidated buildings, and rocky landscapes as they try to find a way out of this twisted world.

Little Nightmares II is not just any horror game; it's an experience that will stay with you long after you've finished playing it. It's full of eye-catching set pieces and terrifying creatures that will have you jumping out of your skin. The game is set to release on February 11, 2021, and it's available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, and PC. Prepare to be terrified when Little Nightmares II drops, and get ready for an unforgettable adventure filled with horror, mystery, and suspense.
