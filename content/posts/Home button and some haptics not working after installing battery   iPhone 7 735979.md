As an iPhone user, you know the thrill of getting a new battery installed. It's like having a new lease on life, the power to go on another day without anxiously checking for the battery percentage every five minutes. So imagine my excitement when I decided to replace the battery for my iPhone 7, which had been showing symptoms of battery wear.

However, what I didn't anticipate was the chaos that unfolded after I replaced the battery, particularly with the home button and haptics.

As soon as I installed the new battery, I noticed that the home button wasn't working as it should. It was barely responsive and required more force to activate than normal. Additionally, the haptics (or the vibrations that accompany button presses, notifications, etc.) were completely out of commission. The phone was vibrating randomly and erratically, almost as if it had a mind of its own. I knew that something had gone wrong during the battery installation, but I wasn't entirely sure what.

After some research online and consulting with an iPhone repair technician, I discovered that the culprit was the home button's flex cable, which had likely been damaged during the battery replacement. The flex cable is the small, delicate ribbon cable that connects the home button to the rest of the phone components. If it's damaged, the home button and haptics won't work properly.

So, how did I fix it? Well, it took a bit of finesse and know-how, but I'm happy to report that my iPhone is now back to its fully functional self. Here are the steps I took:

Step 1: Disassemble the phone

First things first, I carefully disassembled the phone to gain access to the components I needed to work on. You'll need to do the same to fix your home button and haptic issues.

Step 2: Inspect the flex cable

Once I had the phone disassembled, I checked the flex cable for any visible signs of damage. In my case, I noticed that the cable had been slightly torn during the battery replacement process. Yours may be damaged in a different way or not at all, so inspect it closely to determine the extent of the damage.

Step 3: Replace the flex cable

If your flex cable is damaged, you'll need to replace it with a new one. You can find replacement flex cables online or purchase them from an iPhone repair shop. The replacement process is straightforward but requires some skill and patience. Make sure to follow each step carefully to avoid further damaging your phone.

Step 4: Reassemble the phone

Once you've replaced the flex cable, reassemble your phone in the reverse order that you disassembled it. Make sure everything is connected and aligned properly, and test the home button and haptics to ensure they're working as expected.

In conclusion, replacing the iPhone 7 battery is a great way to extend the life of your phone, but it's important to be aware of the potential issues that can arise during this process. If you're experiencing similar issues with your home button and haptic feedback, don't panic - it's fixable! Just follow the steps outlined above and you'll be back to using your phone normally in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I replaced a battery on my son’s iPhone 7.  The install itself was fine, we had no issues  getting the battery replaced and everything reassembled.  The phone booted up fine, touchID worked, but the home button does not work (nor do the haptics associated with it).  But if I try and the touchID doesn’t accept my thumbprint, then the haptics kick in.  So the engine is hooked up properly, it is a home button issue.
I’ve seen this in various forums but no great answer to it.  The home button is on the part of the phone that we did not touch significantly.  All the cables look fine.  We looked for small nicks and kinks and couldn’t find anything.  Any other ideas?

 Firstly check the connector is seated properly. Sometimes you need to put the flex cable under a microscope to see the tear. Since this cable is responsible for 99% of this behaviour on the 7 series you will need to try a replacement screen.

 Did you make sure that all the wires are in?
