Title: Unbelieveable Hack: Watch How I Spliced Two Pieces Of Auger Cable Together To Double My Drain Cleaning Power!

Introduction:
Clogged drains are one of the most common household plumbing issues. Unclogging them can be a daunting task, especially if you don't have the right tools. Auger cables are an effective way to clean out clogs, but they can be expensive and may not be long enough to reach the blockage. However, with this unbelievable hack, you can double your drain cleaning power by splicing two pieces of auger cable together.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Gather Materials: To perform this hack, you'll need two pieces of auger cable, a pair of pliers, and a connector kit.

2. Cut the Cable: Cut the first auger cable with a pair of pliers, making sure to make a clean and straight cut. Try to cut it exactly in the middle to ensure that you have two equal halves.

3. Prepare the Connector Kit: Open the connector kit and lay out all the components. Make sure that you have all the pieces needed to splice the two cables together.

4. Thread the Auger Cables: Take one end of each cable and thread them through the connector kit. Insert the cables in opposite directions so that when you twist them together, they'll tighten the connector.

5. Twist the Connector: Using the pliers, twist the connector clockwise until it's tight and secure. Make sure to give it a good twist to ensure it won't come apart while you're using it.

6. Test the Spliced Cable: Finally, test the spliced cable by using it to clean out a clogged drain. You should notice a significant increase in power and be able to clear out the clog in no time.
