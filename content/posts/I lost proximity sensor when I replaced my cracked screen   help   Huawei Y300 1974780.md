Are you experiencing strange and baffling issues with your Huawei Y300 smartphone? Is your proximity sensor acting up or not working entirely, leaving you unable to receive calls or use other crucial features of your device? Well, read on, my friend, as I uncover my experience with a similar issue and how I sought and found a solution.

Several weeks ago, I dropped my Huawei Y300, cracking the screen in the process. Being the tech-savvy person I am, I decided to fix the damage myself. After acquiring a new screen, I proceeded to replace the broken one, and all seemed well until I tested the phone.

My proximity sensor had stopped working entirely, and I couldn't seem to figure out what had gone wrong. I tried fixing the problem by disassembling the phone and checking the sensor for damage, but to no avail. The problem persisted, and I couldn't receive calls or even unlock my phone.

After many hours of trying to fix the problem, I decided to seek professional help. I searched on Google for smartphone repair shops and found one close to me. I decided to take my Huawei Y300 to the shop and explained the problem to the repairman.

The repairman told me that the issue was merely a misalignment of the proximity sensor during the screen replacement process. He explained that the proximity sensor is attached to the front panel of the phone and needed to sit precisely over the phone's light sensor. During the screen replacement process, it was possible to knock the proximity sensor out of place or even damage it.

To fix the problem, the repairman realigned the proximity sensor and ensured it was correctly attached to the front panel. He charged me a reasonable fee, and thankfully, my Huawei Y300 was back to working flawlessly.

If you are experiencing any issues with your Huawei Y300 smartphone, especially the proximity sensor, it could be due to the same problem I faced. Please seek professional help from a reliable phone repair shop. Do not attempt to fix the issue yourself if you are not experienced in the process.

In conclusion, if you find yourself with a Huawei Y300 possessing a dysfunctional proximity sensor or any other problems, don't worry; there is a solution. Take your phone to a qualified repair shop and let the experts fix the problem for you. It's better to spend a little money and have your phone back to working correctly than to risk damaging your phone further.

## Chosen Solution
 can i get a replacement proximity sensor because I lost mine when I replaced the screen and now my screen goes black as soon as I make a call which stops access to my screen should i need to pick options on my call

 all you need is a scalpel or stanley knife, electrical tape, magnifying glass and determination/patience..
so should this happen to anyone else i thought I'd let you all know that it wasn't the actual proximity sensor i had lost but a tiny 'cushion' with two holes the size of pin !$$&*! that went between proximity sensor and the front casing, i decided to try and make one using electrical tape which i cut to size with a scalpel and then very carefully made the holes with a fine needle (and magnifyer) equal spaces apart, all very fiddly and precise but it worked perfectly once my phone was reassembled....it's a lot easier than it sounds....
