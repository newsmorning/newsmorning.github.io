Article:

Google has revolutionized the way we consume news by offering personalized news feed via its Google News app. With AI-powered algorithms and curated news sources, the app can deliver real-time news alerts, personalized recommendations, and unbiased news coverage right at your fingertips.

However, there are still many ways to enhance your Google News app experience by using some smart tips and tricks. Here are five genius tips that can help you unlock the full potential of your Google News app and become a power user.

1. Customize Your News Feed

Did you know that you can customize your news feed according to your preferences and interests? You can filter out the news sources that you don't like, choose specific topics to follow, and even choose how frequently you want to see news updates.

To customize your news feed, tap on the "For You" tab, then tap on the "Personalize" button. Here, you can add or remove topics, news sources, and even location-based news. The more you personalize your feed, the more accurate and relevant news you'll receive.

2. Explore Newsstand

Google Newsstand is an exclusive feature that lets you browse through a wide selection of digital magazines, newspapers, and journals. You can read the latest issues of popular publications like The New York Times, National Geographic, Vogue, and more.

To access Newsstand, tap on the "Newsstand" tab from the bottom of the screen. Here, you'll discover a range of categories to choose from, including business, entertainment, technology, sports, and more. You can also subscribe to your favorite publications and get updates in the app.

3. Save Articles For Later

If you come across an interesting article but don't have time to read it immediately, you can save it for later. The Google News app lets you save articles to read offline or later, so you don't miss out on anything important.

To save an article, tap on the three-dot menu on the top-right corner of the screen and select "Save." You can find all your saved articles by tapping on your profile picture and selecting "Saved Stories."

4. Use Incognito Mode

If you prefer to keep your news consumption private, you can use the Google News app in incognito mode. This mode prevents the app from tracking your browsing history, search queries, or any other activities.

To enable incognito mode, tap on your profile picture and select "Turn on Incognito." You can switch back to normal mode by tapping on your profile picture again, and selecting "Turn Off Incognito."

5. Set Up Notifications

If you want to stay updated on the latest news, but don't want to keep opening the app, you can set up notifications. The Google News app lets you receive real-time notifications on breaking news, trending topics, and personalized updates.

To set up notifications, tap on the "For You" tab, then tap on the "Bell" icon on the top-right corner of the screen. Here, you can choose the types of notifications you want to receive, including "Breaking News," "Local News," "Top Stories," and more.

In conclusion, the Google News app is already an excellent source of news, but with these five genius tips, you can make it even better. Customizing your news feed, exploring Newsstand, saving articles for later, using incognito mode, and setting up notifications can help you stay on top of the news and become a power user.
