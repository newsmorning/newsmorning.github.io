Are you one of the many iPhone 5 users who are tired of getting frustrated with your phone's LCD screen? Have you recently replaced your old screen with a brand new one, only to find that it's not working as expected? If so, then you are not alone.

Many iPhone 5 users have reported issues with their LCD screens, and it turns out that the problem is not with the screen itself, but with the phone's logic board. Read on to discover the shocking truth about why your new LCD screen isn't working and what you can do to fix the problem.

## The Problem With iPhone 5 Logic Boards

The iPhone 5 was released in 2012, and since then, many users have reported issues with the phone's logic board. The logic board is the main board inside the phone that controls all of its functions. It contains the CPU, RAM, and other important components that make the phone work.

Over time, the logic board in the iPhone 5 can develop faults, which can cause problems with the phone's LCD screen. This is because the LCD screen is connected to the logic board via a set of cables, and if the logic board is not working correctly, then the screen will not function as expected.

## Symptoms of a Faulty Logic Board

If your iPhone 5's LCD screen is not working correctly, then you may be experiencing one or more of the following symptoms:

* The screen is black or unresponsive.
* Lines or other artifacts appear on the screen.
* The screen flickers or flashes.
* The phone restarts or shuts down randomly.

If you are experiencing any of these issues, then it is likely that your iPhone 5's logic board is faulty.

## How to Fix a Faulty Logic Board

Fixing a faulty logic board in an iPhone 5 is not easy and requires expert knowledge and tools. However, there are some things that you can try before seeking professional help.

Firstly, you can try resetting your iPhone 5 to its factory settings. This can help to eliminate any software issues that may be causing problems with the logic board.

If this doesn't work, then you may need to replace the logic board in your iPhone 5. This is a complex process and should only be attempted by a trained professional. However, if you are confident in your abilities, then you can purchase a replacement logic board online and attempt to install it yourself.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, if you are tired of getting frustrated with your iPhone 5's LCD screen, then it's time to discover the truth about why it's not working. The problem is likely to be with the phone's logic board, and fixing it requires expert knowledge and tools.
