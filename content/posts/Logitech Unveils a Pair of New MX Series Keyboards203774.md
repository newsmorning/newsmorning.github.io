# Revolutionary New Logitech Keyboards: The MX Series Upgrade That Will Change Your Typing Life!

Logitech is a company that has been making high-quality keyboards for decades. Their MX series of keyboards is a revolutionary upgrade that will change your typing life for the better. These keyboards are designed to be more comfortable, faster, and easier to use than traditional keyboards.

## Comfortable

One of the biggest complaints people have about traditional keyboards is the discomfort that comes from typing for long periods of time. The MX series of keyboards addresses this issue with a number of features designed to make typing more comfortable. The first is the split layout of the keyboard. This means that the keys are split into two groups, making it easier to reach all the keys without straining your hands. The second feature is the palm rest. This provides support for your hands and wrists, reducing the risk of injury and making it more comfortable to type for long periods of time.

## Faster

The MX series of keyboards is also designed to be faster than traditional keyboards. The keys on these keyboards are more responsive, which means that you can type faster and more accurately. The keys are also backlit, which makes it easier to type in low-light conditions. Additionally, the MX series of keyboards includes a number of shortcut keys that make it faster and easier to perform common tasks, such as adjusting the volume or opening a web browser.

## Easier to Use

Finally, the MX series of keyboards is designed to be easier to use than traditional keyboards. The keys are labeled with large, easy-to-read letters, which makes it easier to find the key you need. Additionally, the MX series of keyboards includes a number of customizable keys that you can program to perform specific functions. This makes it easier to perform tasks that you do frequently, such as launching a specific program or opening a specific file.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Logitech MX series of keyboards is a revolutionary upgrade that will change your typing life for the better. These keyboards are more comfortable, faster, and easier to use than traditional keyboards. So if you're looking for a keyboard that will make your life easier, the MX series from Logitech is definitely worth considering.

Logitech is adding two new high-performance keyboards to its MX line: the MX Mechanical and the MX Mechanical Mini.

 

The main point of the new MX Mechanical keyboard—and it's similar in every way except no number pad counterpart, the MX Mechanical Mini—is to provide options. It's designed to be a high-end modern keyboard with most of the conveniences and features, along with several adjustable elements for a more customized experience.

 

Each version of the MX Mechanical keyboard uses two key color tones, intended to make it easier to separate function keys in your peripheral vision and make your typing a bit smoother. It has a pitch of 19mm coupled with low-profile keys to make typing more comfortable on your hands and wrists, too. And it can last for up to 15 days on a full charge with the backlight turned on (yes, there's a backlight) or up to 10 months with it turned off.

 

But then there are all the ways you can adjust it, including three tactile settings (Linear, Clicky, and Tactile Quiet) for key feedback. So you can choose a hearty snapback, a much quieter reactive bump, or minimal resistance. The backlight also offers smart illumination, allowing you to select from multiple lighting patterns and providing visual feedback for mode switching or connecting to other devices.

 

A new mouse—the MX Master 3S—was also revealed, acting as either a standalone accessory or a companion piece to the MX Mechanical. The new mouse can connect to and quickly switch between up to three different devices, and nearly every function can be customized. It also boasts a much quieter click than previous models—up to 90% less audible noise, according to Logitech. And an 8K DPI sensor allows it to work on most surfaces (even glass) and more quickly jump between screens in a multi-monitor setup.

 

Both MX Mechanical keyboard models and the MX Master 3S mouse will be available soon (May 2022) on Logitech's online shop and from other retailers. You can grab an MX Mechanical for $169.99, get ahold of an MX Mechanical Mini for $149.99, or buy an MX Master 3S for $99.
