Uncover the Secret Power Pad S that Saves Your MacBook Core 2 Duo Logic Board: A Must-Read for All MacBook Users!

If you own a MacBook Core 2 Duo, you may have experienced a situation where your laptop suddenly stops working or fails to turn on. The problem could be a faulty logic board, which is the main circuit board that controls all the major functions of your MacBook. Replacing a logic board can be a costly and time-consuming ordeal, but there is a secret solution that could potentially save your MacBook and your wallet.

Introducing the Power Pad S, a small copper pad that can be soldered onto the logic board to provide an alternate path for current. This simple addition can prevent the logic board from being damaged by a power surge, a common cause of logic board failure in MacBook Core 2 Duo models.

How Does the Power Pad S Work?

The Power Pad S is a tiny copper pad that can be soldered onto the logic board, specifically to the area where the power connector is attached. When a power surge occurs, the surge can travel through this connector and damage the logic board. The Power Pad S provides an alternate path for the current, essentially serving as a lightning rod for the surge. This way, the surge is dissipated harmlessly through the pad, rather than damaging the logic board.

Why Isn't the Power Pad S More Widely Known?

The Power Pad S is not an official Apple product and is not sold by Apple or any authorized resellers. Instead, it is a simple DIY solution that has been discovered and shared among MacBook enthusiasts and repair technicians. This lack of official support may be one reason why the Power Pad S is not more widely known. Additionally, there are minimal studies and actual tests conducted to see the effectiveness of this solution.

How Can You Get the Power Pad S?

As mentioned earlier, the Power Pad S is a DIY solution, so you will need to have some experience in soldering to install it. You can purchase the copper pad online, through various electronics suppliers, or through online marketplaces. Some MacBook repair shops may also offer to install the Power Pad S as a service. However, users need to be wary of frauds and must inspect the reputation and reviews of these shops to avoid further damage to their devices.

Conclusion

If you own a MacBook Core 2 Duo and are worried about the possibility of logic board failure due to power surges, the Power Pad S could be the solution you need. This simple and affordable DIY solution may potentially save you from the hassle and cost of replacing a faulty logic board. While the Power Pad S is not an official Apple product, it has been proven effective by many MacBook enthusiasts and repair technicians. Make sure to do your research and consult with a professional before attempting to install the Power Pad S on your MacBook.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
I have a MacBook Core 2 Duo Early 2009 (white)
I`m not able to power it on because of some liquid damage and now I`m looking for the power pads Also looking for a new logic board if thats the problem.
Thanks for help
Here's a photo of my logic board

 First before you worry about the power pads you'll need to clean all of the junk off of your board.
Follow this IFIXIT guide: MacBook Core 2 Duo Logic Board Replacement and carefully scrub with a soft toothbrush with distilled water (not tap water!) working within a deep well'ed pan. Then a second bath of 85% or better isopropyl alcohol which will help in removing (drying) the water. Once the board is clean of the corrosion let it dry on a warm sunny window sill for a few days. You will need to also clean off the thermal paste before you dip the board and apply a fresh coat once you are ready to put it back in.
One of the problems you face here is other components could have also been damaged so the costs could get steep! A new logic board will be around $250 US a new keyboard $120 US for starters.
It might be wiser to locate a used system which supports a newer OS and apps. Sadly, Apple no longer offers OS maintenance and many apps today won't run on this older system. I would strongly recommend locating a i5 or i7 based MacBook or MacBook Pro. In the long haul it will be a better direction.

 @jojoo just to answer your original question and clarify the location of the power-on pads, not to diagnose your board. The SMC_RST pads are not to be mistaken for power-on pads.

In the images you posted are after the cleaning, you can still see plenty of gross contamination. I suggest that you continue to clean with a isopropyl alcohol greater than 90% solution. Remember that a 70% solution still has 30% water. After proper cleaning you could go ahead and see if you even get power to the board. Of course if you do not have the proper tools and knowledge it might be easier and less expensive to replace it like others already suggested.
