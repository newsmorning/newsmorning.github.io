Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to This Nintendo 64 Game - Light Reveals Hidden Picture, But Only Once?!

Have you ever heard of a Nintendo 64 game that reveals a hidden picture when exposed to light? No, I'm not talking about a secret Easter egg or a glitchy game. This is an actual cartridge that was released in the mid-90s, and it's called "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time."

Yes, I know, it's hard to believe. But trust me, it's real. The game has a special feature that only a few gamers know about, and it involves exposing the cartridge to a strong light source. But be warned - this trick only works once, and if you miss your chance, you'll never see the hidden picture again.

So, what's the story behind this bizarre and mysterious feature? It all started with a promotional campaign for "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time," which was one of the most highly anticipated games of its time. To drum up interest and excitement, Nintendo released a limited edition gold cartridge of the game, which quickly became a collector's item.

But that wasn't enough. Nintendo also decided to include a hidden image on the cartridge, one that could only be revealed under certain conditions. They never publicly advertised this feature, but they did give hints and clues to fans who were paying attention.

And so, it was discovered that if you shine a bright light on the front of the cartridge, a hidden Triforce symbol will appear. The Triforce is a symbol of power, wisdom, and courage that is central to the Zelda series. It's a neat little Easter egg that adds a touch of mystery and coolness to an already awesome game.

But here's the kicker - once you've done this trick, you can never do it again. The image disappears forever, and you're left with a plain, boring gold cartridge. It's almost like the game is playing a trick on you, teasing you with a hidden treasure that you can only see once.

So, what does this all mean? Is it just a fun gimmick, or is there something deeper going on here? Some fans have speculated that the hidden image is a metaphor for the game itself, which is full of secrets and hidden meanings. Others think it's just a cool way to make a collectible even more valuable.

Whatever the case, "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" remains one of the most beloved and iconic games of all time, and the hidden Triforce symbol on the cartridge is just one more reason why. It's a reminder that even in the age of digital downloads and cloud saves, there's something special about physical media and the little surprises it can hold.

So, if you happen to own a gold cartridge of "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time," go ahead and give it a try. Shine a light on it and see if the Triforce appears. And if you miss your chance, don't worry - you can always watch a YouTube video of someone else doing it. But it's just not the same as experiencing it for yourself.

## Chosen Solution
 My N64 hasn't been turned on in a while, when I did try it the light turns on. After turning it off and on a few times, one of those times it turned on for minute with the game on screen, then turned off.  This was the only time it turned on as of recent.  Any ideas?

 Considering the age, I would start by checking the capacitors out.  I found a forum where a user painstakingly created a schematic for board versions 03 and 04

 Turn it on with no game in it.
put the game in with it on.
turn it off and on again.

 I kinda have the same problem.. sadly i still havenâ€™t solved it. Hope we can work it out :\

No video, audio works, half FPS

 try cleaning the game pins with rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab
use 70% to 100% also make the swab damp not soaked
then dry it with the other end of the swab
