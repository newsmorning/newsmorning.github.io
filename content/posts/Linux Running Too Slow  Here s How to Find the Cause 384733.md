# Is Your Linux at a Crawl? Discover the Surprising Culprit with Our Step-by-Step Guide!

As a Linux user, you may have experienced times when your system performance slows down, making it difficult to accomplish basic tasks. Factors such as software bugs, outdated hardware, and lack of system maintenance can cause system slowdowns. However, one often-overlooked culprit of Linux system slow down is the "high load average" issue. In this article, we will explore what the high load average is and provide simple steps to diagnose and fix it.

## Understanding the Load Average

The load average refers to the number of processes that are currently running on your Linux system. A high load average indicates that the system's CPU is working hard, trying to keep up with the demand for processing power. A load average of 1 means that the CPU is at full capacity, while a load average of 2 indicates that the system is running twice as many processes as it has the capacity for.

A high load average can cause system slowdown and crashes. Your system may become unresponsive, and you may experience slow application performance. This issue usually occurs when the number of running processes exceeds the system's processing capacity.

## How to Identify a High Load Average Issue

The good news is that identifying a high load average is easy. Linux systems have built-in tools that can help you diagnose the issue.

To check your system's current load average, run the following command in your terminal:

```
$ uptime
```

The output of this command will provide you with the system's load average for the past one, five, and fifteen minutes. A load average above 1.0 means that the CPU is struggling to keep up with the system's processing demands.

You can also use the following command to check the list of running processes and their resource usage:

```
$ top
```

The output of this command will show you a list of processes currently running on your system. The percentage of CPU used by each process is listed next to its name. If any processes are using a significant amount of CPU, they may be contributing to the high load average.

## Fixing the High Load Average Issue

The solution to the high load average issue may vary depending on the cause. Here are some simple steps that you can take to fix the issue:

### Step 1: Update Your System

If your system is running outdated software or drivers, it can cause the high load average issue. Updating your system's software and drivers can improve system performance and resolve the issue. You can update your system by running the following command:

```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Uninstall Unnecessary Software

Unnecessary software running on your system can contribute to the high load average issue. Uninstalling software that you don't use or need can help free up system resources and reduce the load average. You can use the following command to remove software:

```
$ sudo apt remove <package-name>
```

### Step 3: Increase Your System Resources

If your system is underpowered and struggling to keep up with the number of running processes, adding more resources can help resolve the high load average issue. You can increase your system's resources by upgrading your hardware or moving to a more robust server.

### Step 4: Check for Hardware Issues

Hardware issues such as failing hard drives or faulty RAM can cause system slowdowns and the high load average. Checking your hardware for issues and replacing any faulty components can help fix the issue.

## Conclusion

The high load average is a common issue that can cause Linux systems to slow down and become unresponsive. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can identify and fix the issue to improve your system's performance. As always, remember to back up your system before making any changes to ensure that you don't lose any important data.

There’s nothing more frustrating than installing Linux on your PC and the whole system still feeling sluggish. After spending money building, purchasing or upgrading a machine, you expect it to be snappy. However, that’s not always the case, and with Linux, you can do quite a bit of investigating to check out what’s wrong. Today, we show you how to find the cause of your Linux machine running too slow. 
 
## Why Is My Linux Computer Running Slow?
 
Your Linux computer could be running slow for any one of the following reasons:
 
- Unnecessary services started at boot time by systemd (or whatever init system you’re using)High resource usage from multiple heavy-use applications being openSome kind of hardware malfunction or misconfiguration

 
Before we find out how we can speed up a Linux computer, we need to know which methods can help us find the services started at boot time, processes running with higher or lower priorities, CPU health status, and whether the RAM is filled with much more data than it requires, and also check whether the swap memory area is full. Lastly, we also need to check if the hard disk is working well.
 
## Examine CPU Information
 
When you want to speed up a slow Linux computer, the first step is to check CPU information. If your computer is struggling to open a program like Firefox or LibreOffice, there’s a possibility that it’s because your CPU is not powerful enough for heavyweight applications.
 
Open a terminal and run one of the following commands:
 
The above commands display detailed information about your CPU, such as vendor_id, model name, CPU MHZ, cache size, microcode and bogomips.
 
Let’s go through some important details about CPU information.
 
- bogomips: simply means Bogus Millions of instructions per second. It is a standalone program that displays your system performance.model_name: model_name indicates the manufacturer, model and speed of the CPU. In this case, we have an Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU that has a speed of 1.73GHz.cpu MHZ: cpu MHZ (MegaHertz) is used to measure the transmission speed of channels, buses and the computer’s internal clock. In this case the transmission speed is 1733.329GHz.

 
Here we can see the problem clearly: the Intel Celeron 1.73 GHz CPU is an old processor with little processing power. It’s a single core CPU that runs at a low speed, whereas many newer CPUs run 16 cores at nearly 5 GHz. 
 
### Solution
 
When you have an old and slow CPU, the only solution is to change to a newer one. Learn what you need to look for when buying a new processor.
 
## Check for Services Started at Boot Time
 
There are different methods to check for services started at boot time. You can use any of the following commands.
 
This command lists services started at boot time:
 
This command lists services started at boot time. It is compatible with CentOS, AlmaLinux, Fedora, and RHEL:
 
This command also lists services started at boottime:
 
initctl is a daemon control tool that allows a system administrator to communicate and interact with Upstart daemon.
 
If your system is using systemd, you can use the following command to find the services that run at boot time:
 
For Linux distro that are using systemd, you can use the systemctl command to manage your services, so they will not run during boot time.
 
## Examine CPU Load
 
Apart from checking for services started at boot time, you can also check whether your processor/CPU is overloaded with processes. You can use the command top or any of these system monitoring tools to check CPU load.
 
The top command sorts processes with the highest usage on top. As you can see from the screenshot below, you can clearly identify which process/application is abusing your CPU and kill it if necessary using the kill command.
 
If you are running too many applications (both in the foreground and background), and your CPU is not up to par, it is best to close the applications you are not using. Also, disable any applications you are not using that are running in the background.
 
Alternatively, you can use preload to load commonly used applications. Preload is a daemon that runs in the background and analyzes frequently-run applications.
 
Open a terminal and run the following command:
 
Preload works in the background, so there is no need tweak it. Preload loads a section of commonly-used applications into memory to ensure faster load of these applications.
 
## Check for Free Memory Space
 
RAM is where commonly used applications are usually stored. You can use the free command to check for memory information, such as free space available for RAM and so on. Less memory space can also affect a computer’s performance.
 
Either upgrade your RAM or replace your memory-intensive applications with lightweight alternatives. Applications such as Libreoffice are rather memory intensive. Instead of using LibreOffice, you can use Abiword.
 
## Check Whether Your Hard Drive Is Overworking
 
Is your hard drive light constantly chugging along, yet you have no idea what it’s doing? Mysterious input/output can be a problem, so there is a top-like tool called iotop, specifically meant to help diagnose this kind of problem.
 
Open a terminal and enter the command:
 
A normal, idle system should be mostly zeros across the board, sometimes with a few small bursts while data is being written, as in the screenshot below.
 
If, however, you run a disk-intensive utility like find, you’ll see its name and throughput listed clearly in iotop.
 
Now you can easily find out which program is using your I/O, who ran it, the speed the data is being read, and more.
 
## Conclusion
 
While there are many things that can potentially cause system slowness, CPU, RAM, and disk I/O are behind the vast majority of performance problems. Using the methods described here will help you determine the cause of your performance problems and how you can fix them.
