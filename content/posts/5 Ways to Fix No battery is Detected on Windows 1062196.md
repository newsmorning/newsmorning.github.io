The issue is has been witnessed on all iterations of the OS, including the last two, Windows 10 and 11. So, if you too came across the No battery is detected message, find out what causes the error and the solutions for it in the following sections.
 
## What does it mean when it says no battery detected?
 
When you come across the No battery is detected message, it means that the computer cannot identify one and is subsequently not drawing power from the battery.
 
But it does in no way imply that there’s no battery connected. Most of the time, a fully functional battery is connected but isn’t detected due to software or hardware issues.
 
Oftentimes, it’s the outdated or corrupt drivers leading the problem. Overheating in Windows, too, has been found to be an underlying cause in this case. Besides, if you recently reconnected it, make sure the battery is properly seated. 
 
Here are some of the cases you may encounter the error message:
 
- Sony Vaio No battery is detected
 - Lenovo No battery is detected
 - Acer No battery is detected
 - Asus No battery is detected
 - HP No battery is detected

 
Let’s now walk you through the solutions to get things up and running.
 
## How do I fix no battery is detected on Windows 10?
 
### 1. Run the Power troubleshooter
 
- Type Control Panel in the Search bar, and then click on the relevant search result.
 - Select Large icons from the View by dropdown menu.
 - Click on Troubleshooting.
 - Next, click on System and Security.
 - Click on the Power troubleshooter to run it.
 - Now, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

 
The built-in troubleshooter is often the best way to fix the No battery is detected error message since it does so automatically with minimal effort from your end.
 
### 2. Perform a power cycle on your laptop
 
- Unplug all external devices from the laptop.
 - Take out the battery.
 - Press the power button of the laptop for about 10-15 seconds.

 - Connect the AC adapter and then verify if your machine can detect the battery again.

 
Performing a power cycle helped most users fix the problem in no time. So, before you head to the slightly complex solutions, do make sure to try it.
 
### 3. Update your BIOS
 
If you get the No battery is detected alert on your computer, there may be a problem with the chipset board. 
 
So, you may have to check and install the latest available BIOS update and chipset drivers for your device. Though the linked guide is for Windows 11, the concept remains the same, and it should allow you to update the BIOS in Windows 10 as well.
 
If the problem persists after the BIOS update, head to the next method.
 
### 4. Check the battery and ACPI settings
 
- Press Windows + R to open Run, enter devmgmt.msc in the text field, and click OK.
 - Double-click on Batteries to expand the category.
 - Now, double-click on the ACPI entry to view its Properties.
 - If it does not read This device is not working properly under Device status, first, update the drivers, and if that doesn’t work, check for other hardware-related issues.

 
It could be that your battery is aging and may not show up in the BIOS. Check ACPI settings first to see if the battery shows there.

### Can a laptop run without a battery?
 
Yes, without a doubt, you can use a laptop without a battery. It just needs to be connected to a power source, i.e., the charging cable has to be plugged in and provide the required power.
 
When you see No battery is detected, but the laptop still works, this is because it draws power directly from the power source, just like a desktop.
 
Many users with old-generation laptops use it this way when the battery stops working. But remember that in this case, even the slightest fluctuation in power supply will turn off the laptop, and you will lose unsaved data.
 
### How do I reset my battery?
 
- Save your important work and let your battery drain till it shuts down.
 - Remove your battery and clean any dust in the connectors.
 - Plug in your charger and press the power button.
 - If your PC can work without a battery, allow it to boot up completely and shut it down again.
