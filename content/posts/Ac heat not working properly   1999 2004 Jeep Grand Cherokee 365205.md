Is your Jeep Grand Cherokee turning into an oven? Find out why your AC heat is failing in these model years!

If you are an owner of a Jeep Grand Cherokee, then there is a high probability that you've experienced issues with the AC heat system. In fact, it is one of the most common reasons for complaints by the owners in recent years. The problem is so prevalent that it has created a sense of panic among the owners.

In this article, we will take a deeper look into the causes of the problem, which model years are affected, and what can be done to solve it. So let's dive in!

Cause of the Problem

The most significant cause of the AC heat problem in the Jeep Grand Cherokee is due to a defective blend door. The blend door is a small flap that controls the flow of hot and cold air into the cabin. It regulates the temperature of the incoming air by mixing hot and cold air.

In some model years of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, the blend door is made of a cheap plastic material that can easily crack and break under pressure. This leads to an imbalance between the hot and cold air, causing the AC heat to fail.

Which Model Years are Affected?

The blend door issue is more prevalent in some Jeep Grand Cherokee model years than others. The affected model years include the 1999-2004, 2005-2010, and 2011-2012 years. It is essential to note that the defect is not limited to these years only, as some models produced outside of these years have had the same problem.

What Can Be Done to Solve the AC Heat Problem?

The most effective solution to the AC heat problem is the replacement of the defective blend door with a high-quality one made from durable materials. Jeep has recognised the issue, and they have started manufacturing updated blend doors that are made of more robust materials than the original ones.

If you are facing an AC heat problem in your Jeep Grand Cherokee, the best course of action is to take it to a certified Jeep mechanic. They will be able to assess the situation and recommend the best solution. Replacing the defective blend door is not easy, and it requires expertise and professional tools.

In conclusion, the AC heat problem in the Jeep Grand Cherokee is a well-known issue that has affected some model years more than others. The cause of the problem is the defective blend door made of cheap plastic materials that can crack and break easily. If you are experiencing the same issue, don't panic. Instead, take your car to a certified Jeep mechanic who can diagnose and fix the problem.

## Chosen Solution
 My 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee heat and ac works but not blowing fast through vents just a slow stream on high could find anything in the box obstructing flow and blend door seems to be changing fan blows fast as it should what could be the problem?

 I had a similar problem in a Toyota! The foam seal around the damper flap had broken down making a sticky mess. So when I had the car running the AC  during the summer I had plenty of air flow but when I switched to heat the flap wouldnâ€™t open for the heat box! So the heat was just not getting through.

 If you are sure that you have all speeds, maybe 4 speeds, then I would think the blend door or mode door is not directing airflow to the correct place, seems to be bleeding air to different areas. Even if you see the blend door and mode door motor moving what seems to be full travel, the door itself may not be traveling all the way. Still could be obstructed also.

 @jeepguy14 if your motor is running as it is supposed (make sure of that first) to and you are having airflow issues, you need to check the complete air duct system as well as mode door actuators and the blend door. Make sure that your air inlet is clean so no leaves or other debris may lower the initial air volume. You can test that by changing to recirculation and check if that is the same or if the air flow has changed. This can be pretty complex so I attached the distribution part of the FSM for your information.
