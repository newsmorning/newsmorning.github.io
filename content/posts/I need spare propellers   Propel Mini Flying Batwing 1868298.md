It's no secret that drones and other small aircraft are becoming increasingly popular among hobbyists and enthusiasts alike. Whether you fly as a hobby or for work, it's important to keep your drone in top condition. Unfortunately, accidents can happen all too easily, and without spare parts, a small crash can mean the end of your beloved drone.

As an avid drone enthusiast, I have invested in a Propel Mini Flying Batwing drone, which I have been flying regularly for the past year. It has become an integral part of my life, and I enjoy taking it out for a spin whenever I can. However, after a recent crash, I found myself in a desperate situation.

During one of my recent flights, I accidentally crashed the Mini Flying Batwing into a tree. The drone was relatively unscathed, with the exception of a broken propeller. I quickly realized that I did not have any spare propellers on hand to replace the broken one, and my beloved drone has been grounded since.

Getting replacement propellers for the Mini Flying Batwing isn't difficult, but it does require some time and effort. After searching online for hours, I discovered that replacement propellers could take weeks to arrive, putting my drone being out of commission for the better part of a month.

In order to get my drone back in the air as soon as possible, I am urgently seeking spare Propel Mini Flying Batwing propellers. These propellers are the perfect size and shape for my drone, and would get me back in the air in no time. Without these spare parts, my beloved drone will continue to gather dust on my shelf.

As an experienced drone pilot, safety is a top priority for me. Without proper maintenance and replacement of parts, drones can become unsafe to fly, which can lead to accidents and crashes. This is why it's essential to always have spare parts on hand, so that you can quickly repair your drone after an accident.

In conclusion, if you are a drone enthusiast like me, always have spare parts on hand. You never know when you might need them, and they could mean the difference between getting back in the air quickly or being grounded for weeks. And to all my fellow Mini Flying Batwing pilots out there, if you have any spare propellers lying around, please get in touch – my drone needs them urgently!

 I tried several different types of propellers, but the main problem replacing these is that they are “push” props, meaning they push the drone off the ground, rather than pull it into the air.  Very, very few drones use these types of propellers, so they are hard to find.
I measure the length of the prop as 56mm .   I don’t know the shaft diameter but I would guess that it’s 1mm .
Exact replacements are hard to find as they don’t make these anymore but here’s a listing on eBay:
