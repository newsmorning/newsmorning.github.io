If you're someone who wants to stay on top of the latest gadgets and technology, then you know that keeping your devices up to date is crucial.

But what if you could replace your old screen with a much better one and make your device look brand new again? That's where Jolla's game-changing replacement screen comes in.

Jolla is a Finnish smartphone company that has been making waves in the tech world since its inception in 2011. The company has always aimed to stand out from the crowd and offer unique features that differentiate its products from the rest. Jolla's latest offering is a replacement screen that elevates the user experience to a whole new level.

The replacement screen is made with Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which is stronger and more durable than the regular glass used in most smartphones.

The process is simple, and there are plenty of online tutorials to guide you through it. The modular design also means that if you ever need to replace your screen in the future, you can do it quickly and easily without having to pay for professional installation.

Another great feature of Jolla's replacement screen is its compatibility with multiple devices.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello everyone,
Has anyone managed to find a replacement screen for the Jolla ? Or a screen a + digitizer ?
Jolla support was asking for 120 € for the screen replacement, considering the phone was bought for ~320 €, it seemed a bit steep at the time.
At this point though, this might still be the best/only solution to replace the broken screen on the phone.
Thanks!

 It seems possible to order a spare screen from India:

Since from the website it says that they are only shipping to India, you should send them an email and ask if they ship it to your country. Opening the phone to get the broken screen-unit out is then just peanuts ;-)

 You might find one here.

 It seems possible to order a spare screen from China:
