# You Won't Believe What Happened to My iPhone 4S After Replacing the Dock Connector - Home Button Disaster!

If you are dealing with a damaged dock connector on your iPhone 4S, you might be thinking about replacing it. However, before you proceed, you should know that this repair is a delicate process that requires patience, precision, and attention to detail. Unfortunately, I learned this lesson the hard way when I attempted to replace the dock connector on my iPhone 4S and ended up with a home button disaster.

Here is my story.

After using my iPhone 4S for a few years, I noticed that it was starting to have charging issues. It wouldn't charge unless I held the cable at a certain angle and even then, the connection was intermittent. I knew this was a clear sign that it was time for a dock connector replacement.

I did some research online and found a tutorial that showed me step-by-step how to replace the dock connector. Armed with my tools and my newfound knowledge, I started the repair process.

The first step was to remove the screen and carefully detach the cables that connect it to the motherboard. I was careful and followed the instructions precisely. Then, I proceeded to remove the screws and the metal plate that covers the dock connector. I unplugged the old connector and replaced it with the new one. Everything went smoothly, and I felt confident that I had done a good job.

However, when I tried to test the phone, I realized that the home button was not working. It clicked, but it didn't respond. I tried everything, from resetting the phone to cleaning the connection, but nothing worked. I realized I had a home button disaster on my hands.

I did some research and found out that the home button is connected to the same cable that connects the screen. When I detached that cable, I must have damaged the home button. I was devastated. I had spent hours on this repair, only to end up with a broken phone.

In conclusion, if you plan to replace the dock connector on your iPhone 4S, be very careful. This repair requires precision and attention to detail. If you are not confident in your skills, it's better to take your phone to a professional technician who can do the repair for you. Otherwise, you may end up with a home button disaster like me, and that's not a fun experience.

## Chosen Solution
 I have just replaced the dock connector (and this corrected the problem of impossible shutdown of the  phone) but now the home button is no longer functional. I am pretty sure it worked before. Any clue or suggested investigation before I commit to the difficulties of replacing the home button and/or home button flex circuit ?

 Check the small flex cable connector of the home button, that is connected to the dock connector flex cable you replaced.
Make sure it is secured in the connector.
