Is Dead Rising 4 Doomed? Unleashed Issues Cause Game Crashes, Staggering X Fists DLC Woes, and More!

Dead Rising 4 has been in the market for over a year now, and the recent release of its downloadable content (DLC), Staggering X Fists, has left fans with mixed feelings. While some content is enjoyable, others have reported significant technical issues like game crashes and server problems.

The release of the Staggering X Fists DLC was supposed to bring fans new content, costumes, and a new game mode. Unfortunately, the issues that surfaced do not make it worth the purchase. Many fans on social media have been reporting problems with the DLC, ranging from the inability to connect to the game servers and experiencing severe game crashes when trying to start any of the new content.

To make matters worse, the game's publisher, Capcom, has admitted to two significant technical issues that have impacted the game's stability. The first is an issue that affects the game's pause menu, where it may not display all the necessary information. The second is that the game may crash during cutscenes in the story mode, which can be incredibly frustrating for players who have been invested in the game's story.

Additionally, Dead Rising 4 has been experiencing technical issues from the very start, which have left fans feeling disappointed. Crashes and stuttering during gameplay have been ongoing concerns, and the game has yet to receive an adequate solution. The impact of these issues on the game's overall performance has left fans questioning the reliability of the game entirely.

Moreover, the Mixed reviews and negative feedback for the Staggering X Fists DLC have caused fans to worry about the future of Dead Rising 4. Capcom has yet to address these issues in a way that fans feel satisfied, and the lack of urgency has fans feeling frustrated.

In conclusion, the issues present in Dead Rising 4 and the recent Staggering X Fists DLC release are cause for concern for fans. The game has been plagued with technical issues since its initial launch, and the reliability of the game is in doubt. While fans remain loyal to the franchise, Capcom must address these issues swiftly and make the necessary changes for fans to remain invested. Otherwise, the franchise may be doomed to fail.

Dead Rising 4 is now out, just in time for the holiday season. A mysterious outbreak has overcome the town of Willamette with dangerous and deadly predators. Frank West returns to investigate the source, but he’s got some competition. A  new breed of zombies is after the same evidence. Frank needs to outsmart them if he wants to survive.
 
Apart from this new story line, Dead Rising 4 also brings issues of its own. Capcom has already acknowledged some of them and is working to find a fix. In this article, we’re going to list the most common Dead Rising 4 bugs reported by gamers so that you won’t be taken by surprise if you experience some of them.
 
## Dead Rising 4 reported bugs
 
### 1. Dead Rising 4 crashes on launch
 
Capcom informs gamers that many will experience a first-launch-only crash when they boot up for the first time. Fortunately, this crash won’t affect the rest of the gameplay experience. The game should run smoothly after the first boot up crash. However, some gamers report that Dead Rising 4 actually crashes several times before it runs properly.
 
### 2. Dead Rising 4 X-Fists DLC won’t download
 
Capcom has already acknowledged this bug and is working on a fix.
 
Game needed to be launched 2 or 3 times before it would run for me at all it just went back to the desktop. But on the 3rd try it launched correctly. I use a Local Win 10 profile & sign into the App when it launches not at windows logon. After getting the prompt to associate the Game to my Xbox Live profile it worked fine so it might be related to that if you have not used a Windows Account logon to boot Win 10 up.
 
### 3. Dead Rising 4 crashes randomly
 
Apart from the first-launch-only crashes, Dead Rising 4 is also affected by random crashes. Players report that the game crashes after the 2nd cutscene ends. Also, Dead Rising 4 crashes after Frank enters Willamette shopping mall for the first time.
 
X-Fists DLC will not download at all as you noted.
 
### 4. Players can’t join online matches on Windows 10
 
Some gamers also report they can’t join their friends’ games. It appears that this bug is affecting Windows 10 players only.
 
After the 2nd cutscene ends where Brad is talking to Frank in the classroom just before they get on the helicopter cutscene this 2nd cutscene crashed to the desktop without warning right near the very end. I just skipped this after reloading to continue.
