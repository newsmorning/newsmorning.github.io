Is Your Macbook Air 13 Early 2015 Hinges Broken? Learn How to Replace Them in Just 3 Easy Steps!

If you own a Macbook Air 13 Early 2015, you may have experienced the frustrating issue of broken hinges. The hinges are an essential component of the Macbook, as they allow the screen to be opened and closed. Unfortunately, over time, they can become worn and damaged, resulting in broken hinges that make it difficult to use your device.

Fortunately, you don't have to take your Macbook to a professional to get the hinges fixed. With just a few tools and some basic knowledge, you can replace the hinges yourself in just three easy steps. 

Step 1: Remove the Back Cover

The first step in replacing the hinges on your Macbook Air 13 Early 2015 is to remove the back cover. Start by flipping your Macbook over and using a screwdriver to remove the screws on the bottom cover. Once you've removed all the screws, you can gently lift the back cover off the Macbook.

Step 2: Remove the Broken Hinges

Once you've removed the back cover, you'll have access to the hinges. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws that attach the hinges to the Macbook. Once you've removed the screws, you can gently pull the hinges out of their sockets. Be sure to take note of how the hinges are attached and which screws go where so that you can properly replace them later.

Step 3: Install the New Hinges

With the old hinges removed, it's time to install the new hinges. Start by positioning the new hinges in the sockets and securing them with the screws. Be sure to use the screws that correspond to each hinge and tighten them securely. Once you've installed the new hinges, you can replace the back cover by aligning it with the Macbook and screwing it back into place.

In conclusion, replacing the hinges on your Macbook Air 13 Early 2015 is a simple process that can save you time and money.

## Chosen Solution
 HI
I have followed a HowTo on tightening the screws to correct a loose screen that flops back. Unfortunately, even after removing the screen and tightening the screws I still have the problem. My question is if I was to replace the screen do the hinges come with it and would this be a possible fix? albeit a rather costly solution. My PC is a MacBook Air 13 early 2015 model. 8GB ram and 256SSD. Regards, Allan.

 I think you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater needlessly!
Once you get the display physically off you can replace one hinge to see where that leads you MacBook Air 13" (Mid 2012-2017) Display LVDS Cable That might offer enough stiffness and it's not as difficult as replacing the other side. For reference take a look at what's involved to take the cover glass off in a MacBook Pro MacBook Pro 13" Unibody Mid 2010 Front Display Glass Replacement which is a similar process to disconnect the camera cable.
The other option which I think is a bit extreme is replacing the display assembly MacBook Air 13" (Mid 2013-2017) Display Assembly and the hinges are part of the assembly.
For either the process is the same MacBook Air 13" Early 2015 Display Assembly Replacement
