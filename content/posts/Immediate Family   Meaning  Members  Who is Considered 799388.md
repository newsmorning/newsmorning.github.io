# The Shocking Truth About Immediate Family Members - Who's Really In and Who's Out!

As humans, we all have a fundamental need to belong somewhere. We crave the feeling of being part of a group, and nowhere is this more evident than within our own families. Immediate family members are usually the first people we turn to in times of need, and we generally consider them to be the most important people in our lives. Or do we?

Recent research suggests that there may be some surprising truths lurking beneath the surface of our family lives. It seems that many of us have secret thoughts and feelings about our immediate family members that we keep well hidden from the outside world. So, who's really in and who's out when it comes to our closest blood relatives?

Let's start with the good news. For most people, immediate family members such as parents, siblings, and children occupy a special place in our hearts. They are the people we share our most intimate moments with, and the ones who have seen us at our best and worst. We usually feel a strong sense of loyalty and affection towards them, and we would do almost anything to protect them. In short, they are definitely 'in'.

However, things can quickly become more complicated when we start to examine some of the more nuanced aspects of family relationships. For example, many families have well-established pecking orders that dictate who holds the most power, influence or status within the family unit. This can lead to feelings of resentment or unfairness, particularly if someone feels that they are at the bottom of the heap.

In some families, these power dynamics can be exacerbated by issues relating to gender, race, religion or sexuality. For example, a male-dominated family may not value the opinions of female family members as highly as they do their male counterparts, or a family who values traditional religious beliefs may ostracize someone who does not follow the accepted norms.

On a more personal level, it's not uncommon for family members to have their own hidden agendas or resentments that cause them to exclude someone else for reasons that are not immediately apparent. For example, a sister who has always felt that her parents favored her younger brother may choose to exclude him from family activities as a way of getting back at him.

So, who's really 'out' when it comes to immediate family members? It depends on your family dynamics and the individual relationships that exist within your family. However, some groups may face more challenges than others when it comes to feeling included. For example, LGBTQ+ individuals may be excluded from family activities if their families do not accept their sexuality, and people with disabilities may feel excluded if their families do not make accommodation for their needs.

In conclusion, our immediate family members are usually the people we rely on most in life. However, relationships within families can be complex and fraught with hidden tensions and resentments. While some family members may be firmly 'in', others may feel excluded or marginalized for reasons they cannot understand. The key to overcoming these challenges is to communicate openly and honestly with each other, and to value the unique contributions that each family member can bring to the table.

The clauses in legal and financial documents and company policies may contain information about it that differs from what most people think to be true.

In some cases, these laws limit the visitation of close relatives to permanent residents or restrict cross-border travel.

As a result, immediate or close family members of permanent Canadian residents, including spouses, dependent children, parents, common-law partners, or guardians, will be able to reunite after borders were shut down in March 2020.
 
### How Immediate Family Influences Financial Matters?
 
Whether an employee will get paid or unpaid leaves for taking care of a close one depends on how their company policy defines close relatives. Also, it is subject to laws of a jurisdiction. For example, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) permits employees to take a significant number of leaves to take physical and psychological care of their first-degree relatives. Aside from parents, siblings, spouse, and children, these relatives may include in loco parentis.
 
On the other hand, the human resource departments of some companies may define the term differently. It helps them decide whether an employee is eligible for paid or unpaid leaves to take care of the concerned family member.
 
The immediate family definition plays a crucial role in property distribution after the death of a relative. Even if the will specifies a non-first-degree relative as the executor of the finances, the first-degree relatives will still have access to financial deposits made by the deceased.

Rule 5130 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) imposes limits on brokers and dealers when purchasing shares for their close relatives. For example, they cannot sell new issues like initial public offerings (IPOs) to any person it restricts from availing certain financial benefits. The restricted close relatives could be relatives by blood and lineage and others who are materially supporting or supported by brokers and dealers.
 
### How To Protect Immediate Family?
 
On an individual level, the concept of close relatives is profoundly personal. Most people think of their parents, siblings, spouse, and children as first-degree relatives. Some people have grandparents, uncles, aunts, and other relatives, who are considerably closer to close relatives. There are many ways to protect them both legally and financially.
 
Given the health conditions of the family members, employees need to go through the FMLA provisions. An employee must read their company policies thoroughly and know how they define close relatives. Employees can speak with management if they believe a member who requires special attention due to medical reasons is not addressed in the policy. In most cases, the clauses are negotiable if the person-in-concern has no one else to look after.

### Immediate Family vs Extended Family
 
People often find it confusing to differentiate between an immediate and an extended family. In simpler words, the former is the smallest family unit with all members related by blood. And the latter extends beyond first-degree relatives, and its members have lineage connections.
 
An immediate or close family includes parents, siblings, spouses, and children. When children get married, their spouses and children become immediate members, and the queue goes on. To understand this concept, let us have a central character, John, as an example. 
 
- John is married to Mary, and they both have three children George, Maria, and Sam. When children grow up, George gets married to Lisa, and Maria gets married to Peter. George and Lisa have two children Sarah and Joe, while Lisa and Maria have a son Robert. Sam is still unmarried.

 
In the above example, John’s close relatives are Mary, George, Maria, and Sam. On the other hand, for his grandchildren Sarah, Joe, and Robert, their uncles, aunts, and their families fall under extended family. Unmarried Sam is still the immediate one for John and Mary. That is how it works.

Immediate or close relatives are related by blood, including parents, siblings, spouses, and children. However, in some cases, members connected through birth (grandparents), marriage (in-laws and step-children), adoption, and civil partners and cohabitants are also considered close relatives.
 
Non-immediate family members include grandparents, grandchildren, great-grandparents, great-grandchildren, cousins, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, parents-in-law, siblings-in-law, step-children, adopted children, half-siblings, civil and cohabiting partners.
 
An immediate family starts with parents, their children, and children’s families. When these children connect with the families of their spouses or siblings, it converts into an extended family. Similarly, relations directly connected with the children’s parents, such as their parents (grandparents), siblings (uncles and aunts), cousins, will be considered part of an extended family.
