Have you ever experienced losing something on your phone and it caused more trouble than you thought? Well, I did! I lost the proximity sensor silicone on my iPhone 6S and it caused a lot of inconvenience.

Let me tell you the whole story.

It happened on a regular day when I was at work. I was in a hurry to go to a meeting, so I quickly grabbed my phone and rushed out of the office. As I was about to enter the elevator, I noticed that the screen was not turning off when I put the phone near my ear. I tried it several times, and it still didn't work. I was getting frustrated and thought maybe something was wrong with it.

When I got back to my desk, I checked my phone and, to my surprise, saw that the proximity sensor silicone was missing. I couldn't believe it! I realized that it must have fallen off when I was grabbing my phone without paying attention.

I didn't know what to do, so I searched online for a replacement. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any stores that sold the silicone, and the only way to fix it was to bring it to an authorized repair shop. It was such a hassle, and I didn't have time to go to the shop at that moment.

The day went by, and the inconvenience continued. Every time I made a call, the screen turned off, and I had to manually turn it back on. It was frustrating, and I regretted not paying attention to something so small yet essential as the proximity sensor silicone.

Finally, the next day I went to the authorized repair shop, and they fixed it in just a few minutes. I was so relieved! I realized how much I relied on my phone's automatic functions and how much time and energy it saved me. Plus, it was such a small piece, but it made a huge difference in my phone's overall performance.

In conclusion, I learned the hard way that even the smallest details on our phones matter. Losing the proximity sensor silicone caused me so much inconvenience and frustration, but it also taught me to be more careful and attentive to the things that we often overlook. So, make sure to pay attention to the small details on your phone, or it may cost you more than you think!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello, I’m replaced Iphone 6S Screen but ı lost proximity sensor’s silicone. What should I do?

 The black rubber mesh is actually for the auto brightness sensor. Without it the brightness sensor will be less sensitive to light (to darken screen) but still work.
The other part that goes around the proximity sensor is a transparent plastic piece. That'll help with the sensitivity and alignment of the black plastic proximity sensor on the FCAM flex. Sometimes it'll work fine without it other than be less sensirive.
