Click here for the unbelievable story!\nI’ve always been a fan of rooting Android phones to unlock their full potential. So, when I finally got my hands on the HTC Desire 820, I couldn’t wait to get started. After researching the best rooting methods, I found a tutorial online that promised to help me unlock TWRP recovery in just a few easy steps.\nI followed the guide carefully, but things quickly went downhill when I accidentally deleted the bootloader during the process. I was devastated, fearing that my phone was beyond repair.\nBut that’s when I stumbled upon the unbelievable story that completely changed my outlook on phone rooting. After panicking for a few minutes, I decided to take a chance and see if there was anything I could do to fix the situation. To my surprise, I managed to unlock TWRP recovery without any issues.\nAs I explored the new features available on my phone, I couldn’t believe how much faster it was running. The once sluggish HTC Desire 820 now felt like a completely different device. The additional customization options that TWRP recovery unlocked were a welcome addition, and I couldn’t believe that I’d been missing out on these features for so long.\nBut the best part of the story was yet to come. I later discovered that unlocking the TWRP recovery had also enabled me to install custom ROMs on my HTC Desire 820. I had always heard about custom ROMs and the amazing benefits they offer in terms of speed, stability, and battery life. However, I had never been brave enough to try them out.\nBut with TWRP recovery, installing custom ROMs is a breeze. I tried out a few different ROMs and was amazed at how they completely transformed my phone. The battery life and performance were significantly improved, and the additional customization options were a bonus.\nIn the end, accidentally deleting the bootloader and unlocking TWRP recovery on my HTC Desire 820 turned out to be one of the best things I could have done to my phone. I was able to unlock features that I had never even heard of before and was able to give my phone new life. If you’re considering rooting your phone or unlocking TWRP recovery, I highly recommend giving it a try. You never know what amazing features you might uncover.\nChosen Solution i have htc desire 820. i decided to root my device, successfully unlocked boot loader and install TWRP recovery and accidentally delete my system files now i am trying to connect from fastboot to install stock recovery so that i can restore my old backup but while connecting to computer fastboot recovery showing me waiting for device, so i visited to service center but they told me to replace motherboard pls help dont know what to do ………\nIf you can get it back into TWRP recovery, as @iammjones said, you can connect it to a PC. TWRPs newer versions have an option where you can connect it to a PC and you will see a folder where you can drop files from a computer. You would then copy a known working ROM into that folder (i.e. Download folder – if it doesnt exist, create it). Once the copy completes, disconnect the phone from the PC and then use TWRP to navigate to that folder and install the ROM.
