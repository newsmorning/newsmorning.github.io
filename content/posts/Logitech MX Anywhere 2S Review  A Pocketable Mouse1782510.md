##Discover the Game-Changing Mouse that Fits in Your Pocket - Our Honest Logitech MX Anywhere 2S Review!

As a modern entrepreneur, you're always on the go. Whether you're working from a coffee shop, airport lounge, or your own cozy living room, you need a mouse that goes wherever you go. That's where the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S comes in. This innovative little device packs a big punch, giving you unprecedented control over your computer, even when you're on the move.

###Size and Portability

First things first, let's talk size. The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is a tiny device that fits in the palm of your hand. It measures just 100.3 x 61.6 x 34.4 mm and weighs a mere 106 grams. That makes it easy to slip into a pocket or bag and forget about until you need it. But don't let its small size fool you. This highly portable mouse packs a mighty punch.

###Performance and Durability

One of the standout features of the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is its performance. It uses Logitech's Darkfield™ Laser Technology, which allows it to track on virtually any surface, even glass. That means you can use it on a coffee shop table, an airport lounge chair, or even your own knee, with no problems.

But that's not the only perk. The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S also features seven buttons and a scroll wheel, giving you all the control you need, whether you're navigating complex spreadsheets or editing photos. And with a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 70 days, you don't need to worry about running out of juice in the middle of an important project.

But what about durability? The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is built to last. It has a sturdy, rubberized grip that's comfortable to hold and won't slip out of your hand. And with a four-year warranty, you can rest assured that it will keep working smoothly for years to come.

###Compatibility and Customization

The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is compatible with both Mac and Windows operating systems, making it a versatile choice for any entrepreneur. But that's not all. It also comes with Logitech's Easy-Switch™ technology, which allows you to connect to up to three devices at once and switch between them with the touch of a button. Whether you're using a desktop, laptop, or tablet, the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S has you covered.

And if you're a fan of customization, you'll love the Logitech Options™ software. This free download lets you assign custom commands to each button and adjust the cursor speed and sensitivity to your liking. You can even customize the battery and button indicators, so you're always in the know.

###The Verdict

So, is the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S worth the investment? Absolutely. With its compact size, versatile performance, and customizable options, it's a game-changing device that any modern entrepreneur needs in their toolkit. And with Logitech's reputation for quality products, you can trust that this mouse will deliver on its promises. So why wait? Go ahead and give it a try. Your business (and your wrist) will thank you for it.

We purchased the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is a fantastic travel mouse that offers solid ergonomics in a compact form factor. It’s not going to blow you away in precision or customizable features, but its battery life is incredible. Add to that its multiple-device option—not to mention cross-platform compatibility—and it becomes a fantastic mouse for professionals and business travelers. 

 
##   Design: Small and Sleek  
 

Logitech has a consistent aesthetic across its MX product lineup and the MX Anywhere 2S is no exception. The mouse features a typical layout with left and right buttons, and a scroll wheel sandwiched between them. Additionally, Logitech has included a square button behind the scroll wheel as well as two forward and backward buttons on the thumb-side of the mouse. 

 

The model we tested was graphite, it’s also available in light grey (more of a white) and midnight teal colors for those who want a little more spice in their life. The top of the mouse is coated in a rubberized plastic that has a grippy matte feel to it. The sides are a smooth, semi-glossy plastic while the thumb rest is a faceted version of the rubberized plastic found on the top of the mouse. 

 

A nice design element we noticed in our testing was the placement of the micro USB charging port. Rather than putting it on the bottom of the device or at the rear, the port is dead-center on the front of the mouse, meaning it’s still usable while charging. 

 
We found the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S delightful to work with.
 

One thing we weren’t fond of was the lack of a place to store the included Bluetooth receiver. You don’t need it to connect to a computer, as long as the computer or device you’re using the mouse with has Bluetooth, but it’d still be nice to at least have the option to store it somewhere safe while traveling. 

 
##   Setup Process: Simple and straightforward   
 

Setting up the mouse was as simple as putting the battery inside the mouse, plugging in the Bluetooth receiver, and turning the mouse on. We tested the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S with both Windows and macOS devices and it didn’t have any problem connecting with either. Further tweaks can be made in the respective operating systems’ settings, and there’s also the option to further customize the mouse with Logitech Options, a supplementary program for Logitech devices that adds the ability to switch what the buttons do, adjust the various usage modes and check on battery life. 

 

Setting up the mouse without the included receiver isn’t quite as simple, but doesn’t take too much more work. Whether you don’t want to deal with an extra USB port or are connecting a secondary or tertiary device (the mouse can work with up to three devices at once), the process is done via the computer’s Bluetooth connection settings. 

 

After the mouse has been turned on and the device number selected (via a button located on the bottom of the mouse and denoted with a white LED), all that’s needed is to go through the setup dialog of your Windows or macOS computer. Once paired, the mouse worked just as it did with the included receiver. 

 

Our mouse came just over half-charged, but we opted to give it a full charge before putting it to the test. To do so, we simply plugged in the included cable to our computer and connected it to the mouse using the micro USB port on the front of the mouse. 

 
##   Wireless: Power efficient and quick  
 

The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S features Bluetooth Low Energy technology as well as a dedicated Unifying receiver (2.4GHz) to connect to Windows and macOS computers. In our more than forty hours of testing across multiple devices, we noticed little, if any, difference between using the included receiver and plain Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life didn’t seem any more or less better and the Logitech Options software works regardless of the means of connection. 

 

Using the dedicated Unifying receiver, the mouse is capable of working at up to 32 feet away from the device the receiver is plugged into. Bluetooth doesn’t perform quite this far before getting twitchy, but so long as you’re not in another room trying to use the mouse, there aren’t any issues with distance.

##   Performance: More than good enough for basic work  
 

Logitech doesn’t market the Anywhere 2S as a gaming or high-performance mouse, but it certainly takes inspiration from Logitech’s more advanced mice. It features a Dots Per Inch ( a measure of how sensitive a mouse is) range between 200 DPI to 4000 DPI, which can be set using the Logitech Options software in increments of 50 DPI. 

 

We used the mouse on varying surfaces, from a basic white desktop to bamboo and glass. Aside from an area of the glass desktop where there were scratches, the “Darkfield high precision” sensor didn’t have any issues keeping up with movement. Lag was unnoticeable regardless of connection means and once set up on devices, switching from one computer to another wasn’t an issue. 

 

As previously noted, we fully charged the mouse before taking it for a spin. Logitech rates the battery life for 70 days and based on our usage that appears to be accurate. We did notice more significant drain when using the Bluetooth connection rather than the 2.4GHz receiver, but only by a small margin.

##   Comfort: Not bad for a travel mouse  
 

As expected from a compact travel mouse, the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S isn’t quite the ergonomic masterpiece its larger contemporaries are. Still, it feels good in the hand and the contoured thumb rest helps to cradle the mouse. We spent more than 40 hours testing the mouse which was enough to get a proper feel for it over extended periods of time. It was comfortable, but we wouldn’t suggest using this as a full-time mouse unless you have small hands and want a no-frills mouse. That said, for a compact option, it does a fantastic job. 

 
##   Software: Plenty of customization  
 

Logitech has two accompanying programs that work alongside the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S mouse: Logitech Options and Logitech Flow.

 

Logitech Options is available for both Windows and macOS computers. Once downloaded and installed, it gives complete control over every button and function the mouse has to offer. We were able to change what the two side buttons controlled, switch the left and right mouse click, and adjust the sensitivity all from within the program. 

 

Logitech Flow, on the other hand, is tucked away within the Logitech Options program, but serves the unique purpose of offering cross-computer file transfers. This neat little program makes it possible to transfer things like PDFs, images, and other documents from one computer to another, regardless of whether it’s a Windows or macOS device. 

 

In order for Logitech Flow to work, the program needs to be installed and set up on both devices. Once properly set up, the process of moving files is as simple as selecting the files in need of a transfer and moving the mouse to the side of the computer’s display. So long as the devices are on the same network, the files will seamlessly transition from one device to another, even without the need to switch the device link on the bottom of the mouse. It’s a neat little solution overall, but it occasionally had hiccups with larger files. 

 
##   Price: Expensive, but worth it for discerning travelers   
 

At $79.99 (MSRP), the Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is far from cheap. Yes, it has a number of unique features that other travel mice don’t offer, but even with the added convenience, it’s not exactly a bargain. As we’ll note below, there are a number of other options out there that should get the job done at a much lower price-point. 

 
##   Competition: Plenty of options  
 

The Logitech MX Anywhere 2S is at the top of the charts in terms of features and price, making it a bit difficult to directly compare it to other portable mice on the market. That said, there are two others that offer similar functionality at lower price points. 

 

The first alternative is Logitech’s own M535 Bluetooth Mouse. It retails for $39.99, a full $30 cheaper than the MX Anywhere 2S and offers the same Bluetooth connectivity. It lacks the additional 2.4GHz receiver and swaps a rechargeable battery for two AA batteries, but features a 10-month lifespan, essentially offering the same basic functionality at a lower cost. 

 

The second alternative is the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Bluetooth Mouse. Like the Logitech M535, it retails for $39.99. It has a sculpted ergonomic design, includes a four-way scroll wheel, and works on most surfaces thanks to Microsoft’s BlueTrack Technology. It even has a dedicated button on the side that can be programmed to control different settings.
