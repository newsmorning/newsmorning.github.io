# Revolutionize Your Repairs: Say Goodbye to Old Mechanisms with this 3D Replacement Guide!

Are you tired of struggling with outdated, clunky mechanisms? Are you frustrated with the limitations of traditional repairs?

It's time to revolutionize your approach to repairs with a 3D replacement guide. This cutting-edge technology allows you to create custom replacement parts that fit perfectly, streamline the repair process, and save time and money.

Here's how it works:

## Step 1: Identify the Problem

The first step in any repair is to fully understand the problem. Identify what parts need to be replaced and what kind of replacement is required. Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you are ready to start using 3D technology.

## Step 2: Create a 3D Model

The next step is to create a 3D model of the replacement part using computer-aided design (CAD) software. This software allows you to create a precise model of the part from scratch or even scan an existing part and modify it as needed.

## Step 3: Print the Replacement Part

After creating the 3D model, it's time to print the replacement part using a 3D printer. 3D printing technology has advanced significantly in recent years, making it possible to print high-quality parts quickly and affordably.

## Step 4: Install the Replacement Part

Once the replacement part is printed, it's time to install it. Thanks to the precision of the 3D model and the accuracy of 3D printing, the replacement part will fit perfectly and function just like the original part.

## Step 5: Enjoy the Benefits

With 3D technology, you can enjoy a number of benefits when it comes to repairs. Here are just a few:

- Speed: 3D printing allows you to create replacement parts quickly, minimizing the amount of downtime for your equipment or machinery.
- Affordability: Traditional repairs can be expensive, but with 3D printing, you can save money by printing your own replacement parts instead of purchasing them from a supplier.
- Customization: Thanks to the flexibility of 3D modeling software, you can create custom replacement parts that are tailored to your specific needs.
- Precision: 3D printing produces high-quality, precise parts that fit perfectly and function just like the original.

Revolutionize Your Repairs

In today's fast-paced world, it's important to stay on the cutting edge of technology to remain competitive. 3D printing technology is a game-changer when it comes to repairs, allowing you to create custom replacement parts quickly and affordably.

Don't let outdated mechanisms hold you back any longer. Say goodbye to traditional repairs and revolutionize your approach with a 3D replacement guide.

Step 1

                  3D Mechanism               


 
- 
 - Remove all 6 screws

- 
 - Armrests Will need to be removed from chair
 - 
 - Remove the large bolts  located on the left and right hand side of the chair. These can be removed using a large adjustable wrench.

Step 5


 
- 
 - Next we need to unzip the front of the chair . do so by unzipping all zippers shown in this order. 1 on at top of chair and one at bottom, then one underneath the leather back-pad.
 - 
 - THESE ZIPPERS ARE WEAK AND WILL BREAK EASILY IF FORCED.

Step 7


 
- 
 - The mechanism has a wire harness that runs down to the main PCB in the chair. Most of our 3D mechs come with a new harness pre-attached and the old harness will need to be disconnected from the quick disconnect .
 - 
 - Don't disconnect these if your new mechanism has them  pre-attached.
 - 
 - This is an extremely vague photo , but the quick disconnect is located in the sheath on the lower left hand side of the chair . DON"T  CUT THE SHEATHING JUST THE ZIP TIES . If you cant  get this zip tied onto the frame like the factory had it no worries just make sure its secured in the general location with zip ties .
 - 
 - WHEN RE RUNNING THIS HARNESS BE SURE YOU ARE TAKING NOTE OF THE ORIGINAL  ZIP TIE LOCATIONS .

Step 8

                  Wire harness               


 
- 
 - This is the entire upper harness that connects to the 3D mechanism .
 - 
 - Lower harness that connects to main PCB . see last step for location
 - 
 - Quick disconnect . located on frame .

Step 9

                  lower harness               


 
- 
 - IF YOU ARE REPLACING THE ENTIRE HARNESS FOLLOW THIS STEP, IF NOT THEN SKIP.
 - 
 - Remove the 3 screws on the lower power box cover to gain access to the lower wire harness
 - 
 - unscrew the wire harness clip by removing the 2 screws
 - 
 - These marked connectors are the motor wires and these are not all of the wires on this harness. please see last step

Step 10


 
- 
 - Now lift up on chair piece and push forward. the chair piece should now be separated from the frame piece.
 - 
 - Next remove all 4 bolts on top bracket.

Step 11


 
- 
 - Now remove the upper limit sensor from the 3 plastic pins and move it aside away from the magnet. DO NOT UNPLUG IT
 - 
 - Put the chair into Manual Shiatsu and hit the zone button  2 times , sometimes 1 press. You will know you did it right because the arrows will light up in the middle.
 - 
 - Shows if your in shiatsu mode .
 - 
 - Once these arrows are glowing you can drive the the mech out the top of chair using the UP arrow.
 - 
 - DO NOT DRIVE THE MECH OUT UNTIL THE HARNESS HAS BEEN FREED . SEE  STEP 7&8

Step 12


 
- 
 - Alternatively you can pop out this magnet instead of the sensor . either way manual shiatsu mode has to be used .
 - 
 - BE SURE THIS MAGNET IS ON THE NEW 3D ASSEMBLY BEFORE PUTTING IT INTO THE CHAIR.

Step 13


 
- 
 - The new mech will not come with the plastic wheels , these will need to be transferred from the old mech to the new one. see photo for location of wheels.

Step 14

                  Tips & Extra Things               


 
- 
 - If for some reason you cant get the mechanism into the chair due to the top axle blocking it . Its due to this 3D gear not being set at the correct angle.
 - 
 - To fix the angle simply remove this cover by removing the 2 screws and spin the motor belt until angle is correct.

Step 15


 
- 
 - New mechanism should be installed below you will see some quick tips and reminders during reassembly.
 - 
 - DO NOT TEST MECHANISM IF TOP TRACK BAR IS NOT INSTALLED . WITHOUT THIS TOP BAR ON THE CHAIR THE MECHANISM WILL HAVE ZERO TRACTION AND COULD DAMAGE THE TRACK . SEE STEP 10
 - 
 - Remember to install any sensors you remove and to install them the way they were found  . see step 11
 - 
 - when installing the backrest cover install the 2 middle screws first this will allow the top and bottom screws to automatically line up . see step 1
