## Chosen Solution
 i have working A1474 screen and trying to install on A1893 connector seems to match but when i turn it on its like old TV so are they limiting this from software?

 A1474 - iPad Air
A1893 - iPad 6th Generation
The A1474 LCD display is compatible on the A1893. But probably not the other way around.
