## Chosen Solution
 The microphone cord seems to have a contact failure. I would be able to unweld the 3 little cords inside but I don't know with what cord I could replace it. I have a headphone cord, with a jack, but I'm not sure it'll work... and it has only 2 cords in it, not 3.
Does anybody has an idea ?

 I am guessing because it is a stereo microphone, one is left, one is right, the 3rd is ground. I would suggest asking customer support on monoprice.com for a extension stereo audio 3.5mm and see if they can find out if there is a ground wire.

 Buy a cable with the same type of plug at the end.
For example I see a 3.5mm TRS audio cable selling for $2 plus shipping at monoprice. It has the same plug on both ends.
Just cut off one of the plug and use the cable to replace the bad one.
