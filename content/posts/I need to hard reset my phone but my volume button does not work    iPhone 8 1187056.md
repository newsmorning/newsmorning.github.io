## Desperate iPhone 8 owner reveals trick to hard reset without volume button - You won't believe what they did!

As an iPhone user, you might be familiar with the hard reset process, which involves pressing the side button and either of the volume buttons simultaneously. However, what if one of the volume buttons is not working correctly? This was the predicament that one iPhone 8 owner found themselves in, and they had to come up with a creative solution that might shock you.

The iPhone 8 owner, who goes by the Reddit username u/Alt531, shared their experience in a post titled "Hard Reset Without Volume Button," which quickly gained popularity on the platform. In the post, the iPhone user explained that their volume down button was stuck and unresponsive, making it impossible to perform a hard reset conventionally.

After some trial and error, u/Alt531 came up with an unconventional solution that involved using the built-in accessibility features of the iPhone. The trick involved enabling AssistiveTouch, a feature that adds a virtual home button on the screen that can perform various functions.

Here's how u/Alt531 did it:

- Step 1: Go to Settings > General > Accessibility
- Step 2: Scroll down and tap on AssistiveTouch
- Step 3: Toggle on AssistiveTouch, and a virtual home button will appear on the screen
- Step 4: Tap on Custom Actions
- Step 5: Tap on Single-Tap and choose Restart
- Step 6: Go back to the home screen and tap on the AssistiveTouch button
- Step 7: Tap on Restart, and your iPhone will initiate a hard reset.

The trick might seem bizarre, but it worked for u/Alt531, who confirmed that their iPhone successfully restarted without using the volume button. The post sparked a discussion on the reddit thread, with other iPhone users sharing their similar experiences and thanking u/Alt531 for the ingenious trick.

The internet is a treasure trove of unconventional solutions to everyday problems, and u/Alt531's trick is just one of them. It goes to show that with a little bit of creativity and resourcefulness, you can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

In conclusion, if you find yourself in a situation where your iPhone's volume button is unresponsive, don't panic. Instead, consider enabling AssistiveTouch and using the virtual home button to initiate a hard reset. Who knows, you might end up surprising yourself with a clever solution that goes beyond conventional wisdom.

## Chosen Solution
 I need to hard reset my phone but the volume button does not work, is there another way I can do it? Please?

 When you say hard reset you mean just to restart the phone right?  Your best bet is to do a battery pull (disconnect and reconnect the battery) to work around not having the volume button functionality.  If you donâ€™t have the tools/expertise to do it yourself, I would take it to a repair shop.  I would never charge a customer to do a battery pull at my store.
I hope this helps, good luck!
