# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Replace Your Honda Civic Sport Brake Light Bulbs - 2017 Repair Guide!

If you're the owner of a Honda Civic Sport and you're in need of replacing your brake light bulbs, you're in for a treat. Contrary to what you may believe, replacing these bulbs is not a difficult task, and can be done in a few simple steps. Here's a 2017 repair guide to assist you in this process.

## What You Will Need

Before you begin, gather the necessary tools and materials that you will need. You will need a new brake light bulb, a screwdriver, a pair of gloves, and a clean cloth.

## Step by Step Guide

1. The first step is to locate the brake light assembly. You can find this at the back of your Honda Civic Sport, on either side of the car.
2. You will then need to remove the brake light assembly. This is done by unscrewing the screws that hold it in place. To do this, use a screwdriver to remove the screws that are located on the exterior of the assembly.
3. Once you have removed the screws, pull the brake light assembly straight back. Be careful when doing this, as the assembly may still be connected to the wiring.
4. Next, locate the brake light bulb that needs to be replaced. You can easily identify this by looking for the bulb that is not lit. 
5. Using gloves to protect your hands, gently twist the bulb counter-clockwise to remove it from the socket.
6. Now that you have removed the old bulb, you can insert your new brake light bulb into the socket. Make sure that it is securely in place by turning it clockwise until it clicks.
7. Test the new bulb by switching on the car and applying the brakes. If it lights up, you have successfully replaced your brake light bulb.
8. Finally, replace the brake light assembly. Align it properly and screw it back into place.

## Important Tips to Keep in Mind

- Always wear gloves when handling brake light bulbs, as they can get very hot and may cause burns.
- Make sure that the brake light assembly is properly secured before driving your car.
- If you are unsure about the process of replacing a brake light bulb, consult your user manual or seek assistance from a professional.

Replacing a brake light bulb may seem like a daunting task, but as you can see, it is actually quite simple. By following the above 2017 repair guide and keeping the important tips in mind, you can quickly and effectively replace your Honda Civic Sport brake light bulbs.
