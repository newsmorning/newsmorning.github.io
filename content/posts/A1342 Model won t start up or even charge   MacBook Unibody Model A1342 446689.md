First, let's talk about what the Macbook Unibody A1342 is. It is a model of the MacBook that was first introduced in October 2009. It was popular among students and professionals alike because of its sleek design and powerful performance. However, despite its popularity, the Macbook Unibody A1342 is not exempt from experiencing issues.

What are the common issues with the Macbook Unibody A1342?

There are a few common issues that users may experience with the Macbook Unibody A1342. One of the most common issues is the device's sudden death.

## Chosen Solution
 This question was asked and the answer didn't solve my problem thus asking it again.
I got this Mac (A1342) from a friend who was told by the local Apple Store that the 'battery was swollen' and should be replaced. It will not turn on or charge. Simply dead.
My first thought was the battery thus I have checked and OEM batteries are not available. Not sure if iFixIt non-OEM batteries will sustain the unit. I previously bought a 3rd party battery for a 15" MacBook and it died within two years.
I also hate to replace the battery if it is something as simple as the DC in board needing to be replaced.
I have a similar MacBook as the A1342 and that uses the same Power Supply (P/S) and that Mac charges fine so I know the P/S isn't the issue.
Any ideas?

 I fix mac computers as a hobby, so I am in no way an expert, but in my limited experience, it sounds like the dc in board needs to be replaced.  Replacing the battery will also be necessary.  I have two for this model that were third party and they work just fine.  Taking the age of the computer into account, it could also be the logic board, but I'd have to get my hands on it to give you a more clear answer.  I would start with the cheapest repairs until you find the problem.

 Try turning around the charger at the connection point so its facing away from the laptop â€¦ that was my problem lol
