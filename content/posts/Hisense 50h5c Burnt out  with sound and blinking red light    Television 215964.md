# You Won't Believe What Happened to This Hisense 50H5C TV - Hear the Shocking Sound and See the Blinking Red Light!

Have you ever experienced a sudden and unexpected issue with your TV? It can be both frustrating and bewildering, especially when you have invested time and money into purchasing a high-quality model like the Hisense 50H5C. Sadly, this TV has become the center of attention for all the wrong reasons due to a shocking issue that has left users stunned and horrified at the same time.

The Hisense 50H5C is a 50-inch LED Smart TV that offers excellent picture quality with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. It comes with built-in Wi-Fi and Smart TV capabilities, allowing users to stream their favorite movies and TV shows. However, some users have reported that their Hisense 50H5C TV has a serious issue which not only affects the viewing experience but also poses safety concerns.

The problem began with a loud popping sound emanating from the TV, followed by the power going out and the standby light blinking continuously. Many who have experienced this issue have reported that it feels like the TV is about to explode, and they immediately unplug it from the socket to avoid any potential harm.

The cause of this issue is related to a defect in the power supply board of the TV. The defect causes the capacitors on the power supply board to bulge and fail, triggering the popping sound and blinking light issue. The defect is so widespread that a class-action lawsuit has been filed against Hisense, alleging that the company is aware of the defect yet continued to sell the defective TVs to customers.

Many users have shared their experiences with this issue on forums and social media, and the common denominator is that Hisense has provided little to no assistance when the issue arises. Several users have reported that the customer service from Hisense has been unresponsive, and the warranty provided is insufficient to cover the cost of repair.

The solution to this issue is to replace the defective capacitors on the power supply board. However, this requires technical knowledge and expertise, and many users end up paying hundreds of dollars to repair their TVs. Some have even given up on their Hisense 50H5C TV altogether and purchased a new one from a different brand.

In conclusion, the Hisense 50H5C TV issue is a serious one that could potentially harm users and damage property. If you own a Hisense 50H5C TV, it's essential to keep an eye out for any signs of a popping sound, a power outage, and blinking lights. If you experience any of these symptoms, unplug the TV immediately and seek professional assistance. It's also advisable to contact Hisense's customer service and raise the issue in case of a recall or to avail warranty coverage. The issue is a stark reminder that even reputed brands can have defects, and it's always wise to do your research before investing in a TV.

 Watching the worst show ever made, (TWD) and right as one of my least favorite characters tells her husband that she slept with his partner My screen flashes twice and the TV goes blank. No back light, No bouncing screen saver thingy. The only thing i got is sound. Looks like this question has been asked a lot and i cant find much of an answer. Although i did find a video on YouTube were a guy steps you through breaking the TV down and fixing a few issues. I’m just looking to see if anyone has any other info on this matter. Seems to be a common issue.

 Hi @bobnwhitney ,
Try shining a torch at an angle close to the screen when the TV is on and there is audio to check if there are any images at all on the screen.
They will be very faint if they are there, so trying this in a darkened room may help.
If there are images then you have a TV LED backlight problem.
You will then have to determine if it is a power board problem or a backlight LED problem.
You could try measuring the backlight voltage supply on the power board or you could purchase a backlight tester - example only that will test the backlights and if OK then you know that the power board is the problem.
Here’s a video that shows how to replace the TV LED backlights if they are faulty.
If there are no images then you may have a mainboard, tcon or power board problem.
Check out the power board for any obvious component damage such as burnt out components or bulging capacitors etc
