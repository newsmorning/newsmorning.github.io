# Revolutionary Payments Makeover: 5 Epic Trends to Take Uganda by Storm - Get Ahead of the Game!

Uganda, one of the most promising African economies, is witnessing a revolutionary payments makeover. The country has taken significant strides in recent years to move from a largely cash-based economy to a digital one. This trend is driven by a growing number of factors, including financial inclusion, government initiatives, and technological advances. 

In this article, we will highlight five epic trends that are set to take Uganda by storm and enable citizens and businesses to get ahead of the game in the revolutionized payments landscape. 

## 1. Mobile Money 

Mobile money is taking the payments market by storm in Uganda, and it is not showing any signs of stopping. Over 25 million Ugandans are registered for mobile money accounts, making it the most popular method of making payments in the country. This trend is driven by the convenience and accessibility of mobile money services, which allow customers to make payments, transfer money, and conduct other financial transactions from their mobile phones. 

## 2. Digital Wallets 

Digital wallets are becoming increasingly popular in Uganda, and this trend is set to continue. Digital wallets allow users to store and manage their payment and financial information in one convenient location. In Uganda, numerous digital wallet providers, including MTN MoMoPay, Airtel Money, and CenteMobile Wallet, are driving this trend. This means that businesses and consumers can enjoy fast, secure, and affordable payments and transfers, without the added cost of traditional banking fees. 

## 3. Contactless and Near-Field Communication (NFC) Payments 

Contactless and NFC payments are transforming the way people make payments in Uganda. This trend is driven by the rise of smart devices, which are now equipped with NFC technology. Payments via contactless technology, such as QR codes, are set to grow rapidly in Uganda, as it reduces the need for physical contact during transactions, which is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. Companies like Interswitch are focusing on bringing NFC technologies to Uganda. 

## 4. Blockchain-Based Payments 

Blockchain is starting to gain traction as a viable payment solution in Uganda. Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions securely, transparently, and cost-effectively. This technology is ideal for payments in Uganda, as it offers secure and transparent transactions, reduced transaction costs, and fast processing times. Innovators like Teso Tech, BitPesa, and others, are operating in this space, and making strides in digitizing Uganda's economy. 

## 5. Biometric Payments 

Biometric payments are on the rise in Uganda, a result of the National Identification and Registration Authority's (NIRA) biometric registration of all citizens. Biometric payments use a person's unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, as an identifier for transactions. This technology is secure, as no one can replicate a person's biometrics, and it reduces the need for traditional identification documents like IDs and passports. It is also useful for businesses since it minimizes the risk of fraud and reduces operating costs. 

In conclusion, Uganda's payments infrastructure is undergoing a monumental shift. Not only is this nationwide transformation driven by government policies, but also by the rapid adoption of innovative technologies such as blockchain, biometrics, and digital wallets. Understanding these five epic trends and investing in the right payments infrastructure, will position Uganda's citizens and businesses at the forefront of the digital revolution in Africa.

Technology is impacting our lives in ways which we could never have imagined. You probably spend most of your work day in front of a computer working emails, presentations, spread sheets and whatever software tool your business operates. You are probably one of  the one billion people who use Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate with friends, family and business.
 
If you’re more advanced, you’re using tech to track your health, monitor your home and get directions to where you’re going.
You have also probably done  mobile payments using mobile money with services like MTN Uganda Mobile Money and Airtel Money have conducted online payments with your credit /debit card.
 
This trend of technology working to make our lives “easier” and getting us more connected is going to continue. These  are some of the trends we see happening in electronic payments industry in Uganda, Kenya and other emerging markets in the near future.
 
## #1. Mobile phones and mobile wallets
 
Ugandans are already transacting over one million times in day using their mobile phones. In fact Uganda and our neighbors Kenya and Tanzania have the most sophisticated and successful mobile money deployments in the entire world. The rest of the world is grappling with inefficient card system of payment.
 
With increased mobile network penetration and mobile phones becoming more ubiquitous, mobile phones will become the de facto method of transacting in Uganda and other emerging markets.
 
## #2. Convergence of Mobile wallet and Banks
 
Most banks offer some sort of online web banking, but this is not optimized for mobile. Bank of Africa has released a powerful mobile banking application that allows you to do a lot of banking functions on your mobile phone. This trend will continue with many others banks releasing mobile apps and /or partnering with mobile wallet providers like MTN and Airtel. This means that you will be able to do things like withdrawing money from ATM without a card, getting loans, making payments and lots of other banking functionality on your mobile phone without visiting your brick and mortar bank branch.
 
## #3. A more cashless society
 
90% of these transactions on mobile money are peer to peer (ie. Person A sending money to Personal B). The other 10% is used to pay for goods and services e.g. utility bills, television subscriptions, buying airtime, gaming etc.
In the next few years we should see payments moving beyond peer to peer so that you can go to a super market, get a taxi ride, pay concert tickets etc. using your mobile money and other variations of it leading to a more cashless society. The challenge here is to make mobile payments as simple to use as cash
 
## #4. Changes in regulation
 
As more and more people start to use their mobile phones and wallets to make payments issues of privacy, security and safety will arise. Our regulators will need to awaken from their slumber and mini skirt discussions to enact laws that should not stifle innovation but protect consumers and businesses in the mobile payments sector.
One such regulation is the agency banking act that will allow banks to do banking outside of banking halls – this may actually spur growth of a banked population in Uganda.
 
## #5. The rise of electronic /cryptographic currencies
 
Electronic currencies or money like Bitcoins are generated and managed using complex mathematical algorithms and the internet.
This might sound geeky, but these currencies are gaining traction and even big internet companies like eBay and Tesla motors accept Bitcoins as a method of payments. As these currencies become more main stream, we expect to see Ugandans to transact more with electronic currencies.
