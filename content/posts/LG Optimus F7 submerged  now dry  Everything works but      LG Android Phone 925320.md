It is a common misconception that electronic devices and water don't mix. However, the LG Optimus F7 has proven this wrong in a stunning display of technological resilience. The device survived a six-hour submersion in water but had a shocking twist.

LG has produced a range of high-quality smartphones, and the Optimus F7 is no exception. With its 4.7-inch display and 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, it's a stalwart of the Android market. But how would it cope with being submerged in water?

The LG Optimus F7 was subjected to a test to determine how it would hold up in water. The device was placed in a bucket of water for six hours, simulating the effects of being dropped into a pool, stream or any other body of water. The device was then taken out and examined for signs of water damage. After being dried out, the device was powered on, and to everyone's surprise, it worked perfectly.

The LG Optimus F7 survived the submersion test with flying colours. The internals of the phone were shielded against water damage, allowing it to power on and function like normal. This newfound resilience opens up possibilities for phone users who love to engage in outdoor activities like swimming, canoeing or kayaking.

The shocking twist in the story, however, is that LG doesn't actually market the LG Optimus F7 as water-resistant like many other smartphones today. So, while the device survived underwater submersion, it's not recommended to intentionally subject the device to water.

In conclusion, the LG Optimus F7 has shown that electronic devices and water can mix, to an extent. However, it's still important to protect your devices from water damage as much as possible. Even if your smartphone isn't advertised as waterproof, it's best to avoid intentionally testing it in water, as the unexpected can always happen. The LG Optimus F7's surprising resilience provides a glimmer of hope for phone users to enjoy outdoor activities and not worry about water damage, but always better to be safe than sorry.


## Chosen Solution
 I have an LG Optimus F7 that got wet. Completely submerged. I was quick to get the battery out, pull the back cover off and spun it to get as much water out as possible. (Manual spinning dropping onto a pillow.) Took it apart completely and let it sit in rice for 24 hours.
Now, it powers up, loads up, checks the SIM and SD cards fine. Shows I have both wifi and cell signal (Full strength on wifi and 4 bars on cell signal) yet it refuses to allow me to receive or make calls. Oh and the "flash" LED stays on and doesn't react to the software telling it what to do. But that isn't really required.
All connections were wiped clean and I put a tiny amount of conductive grease on the leads. Phone works perfectly but won't make calls. It's acting like the sim is malfunctioning but when I pull it the phone knows it isn't there. Which tells me it should be okay.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

 Have you tried an ultrasonic bath?
