Title: You Won't Believe Why the Charger Cord Doesn't Stay In Your LG K20 Plus - Shocking Solution Revealed!

Have you been experiencing some trouble with charging your LG K20 Plus? Do you find yourself constantly having to plug in the charger cord because it keeps falling out of the charging port? Well, you're definitely not alone. Many LG K20 Plus users have been complaining about the same issue.

In this article, we're going to reveal the shocking truth behind why the charger cord doesn't stay in your LG K20 Plus and provide you with a simple solution to fix it.

The Problem

The main reason why the charger cord doesn't stay in your LG K20 Plus is due to a design flaw. Unlike other smartphones, the charging port of the LG K20 Plus is located on the side instead of the bottom. This means that when you plug in the charger cord, the weight of the cord pulls down on the charging port, causing it to loosen and eventually disconnect.

The Solution

Many LG K20 Plus users have resorted to using charging docks or wireless chargers to solve this problem. However, these alternatives can be quite expensive and may not be convenient for everyone. Fortunately, there is a simple solution that doesn't require any extra equipment or costs.

All you need to do is fold a small piece of paper, such as a Post-it note, and slide it into the charging port alongside the charger cord. This will provide extra support to the port and prevent it from being pulled down by the weight of the cord. The paper should be folded in a way that it fits snugly into the port without damaging it.

By doing this, you'll be able to charge your LG K20 Plus without having to worry about the charger cord falling out. This simple trick has been tested and proven to work by many LG K20 Plus users.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the reason why the charger cord doesn't stay in your LG K20 Plus is due to a design flaw. But, there is a simple solution to solve the problem without spending any extra money. All you need is a small piece of paper and a few seconds of your time. Give it a try and say goodbye to the frustration of always having to plug in your charger cord.
