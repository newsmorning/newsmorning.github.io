Title: Uncover the Hidden Location of the Game-Changing Seatruck Perimeter Defense Upgrade in Subnautica Below Zero!

Introduction:

Subnautica Below Zero is an underwater exploration game that takes you to the depths of the ocean on a mission to survive and uncover the mysteries of an alien planet. One of the key tools at your disposal is the Seatruck, a modular underwater vehicle that can be customized with various upgrades to enhance its capabilities. In this article, we will take a look at one of the most game-changing upgrades – the Seatruck Perimeter Defense – and uncover its hidden location.

Section 1: What is the Seatruck Perimeter Defense?

The Seatruck Perimeter Defense is an upgrade that adds a powerful defensive capability to the Seatruck. It adds a perimeter of electric shocks around the vehicle, which can zap and stun any hostile creature that comes too close. This upgrade is a game-changer because it provides a significant boost to the vehicle's defensive capabilities, making it easier to explore areas that were previously too risky to venture into.

Section 2: Where to Find the Seatruck Perimeter Defense?

The Seatruck Perimeter Defense is not a standard upgrade that you can find in Subnautica Below Zero. Instead, you will need to venture into a specific location to uncover its blueprint. The location is the Deep Twisty Bridges, a biome that is located west of the Delta Island.

To find the blueprint, you will need to look for a fragment on the ocean floor. The fragment is located in the southwestern part of the biome, close to a large rock formation. You will need to use your scanner to locate the fragment, which will then give you the blueprint for the Seatruck Perimeter Defense.

Section 3: How to Craft the Seatruck Perimeter Defense?

After obtaining the blueprint, you can craft the Seatruck Perimeter Defense using the Seatruck Fabricator in the Seatruck docking module. You will need the following resources:

- Uraninite Crystal x2
- Advanced Wiring Kit x1
- Titanium Ingot x1
- Battery x2

Once you have gathered these resources, you can use the Seatruck Fabricator to craft the upgrade. Once installed, the Seatruck Perimeter Defense will be activated automatically when a hostile creature comes too close to the vehicle.

Conclusion:

The Seatruck Perimeter Defense is an essential upgrade for any Subnautica Below Zero player who wants to explore the depths of the ocean with greater confidence. By adding an electric shock perimeter around the vehicle, this upgrade can stun and repel hostile creatures, making it easier to navigate dangerous biomes. The hidden location of the blueprint in the Deep Twisty Bridges biome adds an additional layer of challenge and excitement to the game. Happy exploring!

This will send off the charge around the Sea truck and shock away from the leviathans and other creatures. If you hold the left click for a few seconds it will increase the shock radius.
 
The perimeter defense does eat up some power from the Sea truck. As a matter of fact, bigger blasts drain a lot of energy as they use 7.5% of it at once. Shock might not kill the creature but it will reduce the damage on your Sea-truck and reduce the time spent repairing it.
 
It is one of the strongest sea truck upgrades you will get in the game. It is only available at one spot in the in addition to that, the spot can only be unlocked in the latter half of the game.
