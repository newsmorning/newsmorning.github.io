As a business owner, it is essential to know how to calculate your assets’ depreciated costs. Depreciation is the process of the value of your asset’s reduction over time due to its age or wear and tear. When you depreciate an asset, you spread its value over its useful life. By doing so, you can determine the asset’s annual cost to your business.\nMany business owners struggle with calculating the depreciated cost of their assets, and as a result, they end up overpaying for them. By learning how to calculate depreciated costs, you can save thousands of dollars in taxes and other expenses. In this article, we will reveal the secret formula for calculating depreciated costs.\nThe Secret Formula The formula for calculating the depreciated cost of an asset is quite simple. You need to know the asset’s useful life and its initial cost. Once you have this information, you can use the following formula:\nDepreciated Cost = (Initial Cost - Salvage Value) ÷ Useful Life\nTo better understand this formula, let us break it down into its parts:\nInitial Cost – This is the purchase price of the asset, including all installation and delivery costs.\nSalvage Value – This is the expected resale value of the asset at the end of its useful life. It is the amount that you expect to sell the asset for once it has reached the end of its useful life.\nUseful Life – This is the expected duration of the asset’s usefulness. For example, if you purchase a computer that has a useful life of three years, you can use the computer for three years before it is considered obsolete.\nBy using this formula, you can determine the annual cost of the asset. Once you know the asset’s annual cost, you can use this information to make better decisions about purchasing new assets and replacing old ones.\nExample To better understand this formula, let us go through an example. Suppose you purchase a new delivery truck for your business. The truck has an initial cost of $50,000, and you expect it to have a useful life of five years. At the end of its useful life, you expect to sell the truck for $5,000.\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the depreciated cost of the truck:\nDepreciated Cost = ($50,000 - $5,000) ÷ 5 years = $9,000\nThis means the annual cost of using the delivery truck would be $9,000. By knowing the annual cost, you can determine whether it is financially feasible to purchase the truck.\nConclusion Calculating depreciated costs is an essential skill for any business owner. By learning how to calculate the depreciated cost of your assets, you can make informed decisions about purchasing new assets and managing existing ones. The secret formula for calculating depreciated costs is easy to use and can save you thousands of dollars. Now that you know the formula, you can start saving money today!\nWhat is the Depreciated Cost? Depreciated Cost of an asset is its value after charging total depreciation to date that has been accrued. Thus, it represents the remaining value of an asset that has to be utilized over its remaining life.\nFormula Depreciated Cost of an Asset can be calculated using the following formula:\nDepreciated Cost Formula = Original Cost – Accumulated Depreciation\nHow to Calculate Depreciated Cost? To calculate the depreciated cost of an asset, we need to deduct the accumulated depreciationAccumulated DepreciationThe accumulated depreciation of an asset is the amount of cumulative depreciation charged on the asset from its purchase date until the reporting date. It is a contra-account, the difference between the asset’s purchase price and its carrying value on the balance sheet.read more from the asset’s original cost.\nOriginal cost is the cost incurred on purchasing the asset and other expenses incurred to bring it to working condition. In other words, we can say the original cost means the purchase price of an asset and includes other related expenses incurred on it, like installation expenses.\nAccumulated depreciation is the total value of depreciation that has been charged on an asset to date. Depreciation is an expense that is booked against the cost of an asset to reduce the asset’s value to its estimatedSalvage value or scrap value is the estimated value of an asset after its useful life is over. For example, if a company’s machinery has a 5-year life and is only valued $5000 at the end of that time, the salvage value is $5000.read more salvage valueSalvage ValueSalvage value or scrap value is the estimated value of an asset after its useful life is over.

It represents the amount of value the owner will obtain or expect to get eventually when the asset is disposed.read more) throughout its estimated life. Thus by charging depreciation, a company reduces the cost of the asset year by year to ultimately reduce the value to the salvage value at the end of the life of the asset.\nYou are free to use this image on you website, templates, etc., Please provide us with an attribution linkHow to Provide Attribution?Article Link to be HyperlinkedFor eg:Source: Depreciated Cost (wallstreetmojo.com)\nExamples of Depreciated Cost Let us understand this concept using a few examples.\nExample #1 A company had purchased a piece of equipment for $2,000 in 2012. The company charged Depreciation on Equipment refers to the decremented value of an equipment’s cost after deducting salvage value over the life of an equipment. It lowers its resale value.read moreequipment depreciation is $400 till the year ending 2018.\nSolution\nCalculation of Depreciated Cost\n= $2,000 – $400= $1,600 Here, the company had charged a total depreciation of $400 from 2012 till the year 2018. The same reflects the accumulated depreciation on the equipment. On the other hand, the company had purchased the equipment for a total cost of $2,000. Thus, at the end of 2018, depreciated value comes out to $1,600 after reducing the accumulated depreciation of $400 from the original cost of $2,000.\nExample #2 A company had purchased a piece of machinery in 2015 and incurred the following expenses on its acquisition.\nCost Price: $3,200Conveyance: $10Installation Charges: $50Depreciation charged by the company till the end of the year 2018 amounted to $300. Now,\nLet us calculate the original cost first.\nOriginal Cost = Cost Price + Conveyance + Installation Charges\n= $3,200 + $10 + $50 Original Cost = $3,260\n=$3260-$300\nHere, the company had charged a total depreciation of $300 from the year 2015 till the year 2018. The same reflects the accumulated depreciation of the machinery. On the other hand, the company had incurred a total expense of $3,260 concerning the purchase of the machinery. Thus, at the end of 2018, the depreciated value comes out to be $2,960 after reducing the accumulated depreciation of $300 from the original cost of $3,260.\nRelevance and Use The depreciated cost of an asset reflects its residual value, i.e., that part of the cost that is yet to be utilized over the asset’s remaining life. It helps a company present its assets in the books of account at its current cost value. This concept allows for decreasing the asset’s cost over its useful life. It is important to note that this formula represents the book value of the assetBook Value Of The AssetBook Value of Assets is the asset’s value in the books of records of a company or an institution at any given instance. Assets Book Value Formula = Total Value of an Asset – Depreciation – Other Expenses Directly Related to it read more and not the market value.\nThe gains on the asset sale can be calculated by comparing the selling price against the depreciated cost. The resulting difference will be a gain or loss on the asset’s sale.\nConclusion The depreciated cost of an asset represents the remaining value of the asset that is to be amortized over its remaining life. Also, the fair value is different from the depreciated cost, and the fair value of an asset may be more than the carrying amountCarrying AmountThe carrying amount or book value of asset is the cost of tangible, intangible assets or liability recorded in the financial statements, net of accumulated depreciation or any impairments or repayments. Accordingly, the carrying amount may differ from the market value of assets.read more of an asset.\nRecommended Articles This article has been a guide to Depreciated costs.
