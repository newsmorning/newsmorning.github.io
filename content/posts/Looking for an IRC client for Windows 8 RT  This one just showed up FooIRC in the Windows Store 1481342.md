Windows 8 only: If you are looking for an IRC client for the new Windows 8 metro design UI, today you are in luck. As you know Microsoft is prohibiting the installation of traditional applications other than Office 2013 in Windows RT (ARM version of the operating system). This means that if you want to use mIRC, let say in the Microsoft Surface tablet, you will be left in the cold, but now there is a Windows Store app called FooIRC and it offers most of the features found in mIRC with the difference that runs in Windows RT and in Windows 8 because of its support on ARM, x86 and in x64 architecture.
 
## Features
 
- Multi-server support
 - Save servers and channels
 - Auto-join channels
 - Connect using SSL
 - Auto-identify with Nickserv
 - Switch server views by swiping
 - Nickname color highlighting
 - Timestamps
 - Auto-reconnect on disconnections
 - Channel message font size options
 - Nickname complete (TAB)

 
The app works like a charm, but the configuration is a bit geeky. You first need to know the server you are connecting to. Once the connection is established, you can add a server or join a channel by accessing the app menu with a right-click anywhere in the screen.
 
If you are trying to get access to a channel, click on Join a channel from the app menu, choose the server, enter the channel’s name and click Join.
 
FooIRC is a paid Windows 8 app, however you can try it for free. To give it a try use the link below.
