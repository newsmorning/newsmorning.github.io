If you own an iPad Pro 9.7, you may have noticed some issues with the home button. Many users have reported that their home buttons have become unresponsive, making it difficult to navigate through their device. Here's what's happening to iPad Pro 9.7's home button and whether replacement is the best option. 

## The Issue with the Home Button

The home button is an essential part of the iPad Pro 9.7, as it allows you to return to the home screen, access Siri, and perform other actions. Unfortunately, many users have experienced issues with their home buttons, such as becoming completely unresponsive or only working intermittently. 

This issue can be frustrating and quite limiting, as it restricts how you use your iPad Pro 9.7. Some users have even reported that they had to rely on the AssistiveTouch feature to access the home button's functionality, which can be impractical in the long run.

## Causes of the Issue

Several factors could contribute to the issue with the home button. One of them could be a physical fault, such as a damaged or worn-out button. In contrast, others could be software-related, such as a bug or underlying software issue.

It's essential to identify the cause of the problem before deciding on whether to replace the home button or not. This will ensure that you're not investing in a replacement that may not fix the problem in its entirety.

## Replacement Options

If you're experiencing problems with your home button, you may be considering a replacement. Several options are available when it comes to replacing the home button on your iPad Pro 9.7.

The first and most common option is to bring your device to an authorized Apple technician. These professionals will diagnose the problem and recommend the best solution for you. In many cases, they will replace the home button altogether.

Another option is to attempt a DIY replacement. However, this can be tricky, especially if you're not tech-savvy. This option is recommended only if you're confident and have experience with repairing electronic devices.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the home button issue with the iPad Pro 9.7 can be frustrating and limiting. However, there are options available to fix the problem. If your device is still under warranty or AppleCare, a visit to an Apple technician is the best course of action. Otherwise, if you're confident enough, you may try a DIY replacement. 

Whichever option you choose, remember to identify the cause of the problem first. This will ensure that you don't invest in a replacement that may not fix the underlying issue.

## Chosen Solution
 I've replaced the home button on an ipad pro 9.7
I know there is a black gasket ring on the rear of the button
assembly, but the button fits loosely....is there a gasket or spacer
that is supposed to be installed on the front of the button to the
rear of the digitizer?  there is space between the back of the button
and the plate that covers it.....
what am I missing?
thanks
Jay

 Hi you will have to break down the ipad again and either use stronger adhesive or use a glue made for electronics like B7000.
