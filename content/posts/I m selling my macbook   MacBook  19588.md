# Insane deal alert: Get your hands on a MacBook for a fraction of the price - but hurry, it won't last long!

Are you in dire need of a new laptop but don't want to break the bank? Look no further than this insane deal alert. Right now, you can get your hands on a MacBook for a fraction of its usual retail price. But act fast, because this sale won't last long!

So, how much can you expect to save? We're talking discounts of up to 50% off here. That's right, you could snag a MacBook for half off its usual price. And let's be real, that's a steal.

This deal isn't just limited to one type of MacBook, either. No matter if you're in the market for a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro, you're sure to find a great deal. Whether you're a student in need of a reliable computer for remote learning or a professional looking to upgrade, this sale is perfect for anyone.

But where can you find this incredible deal? Of course, it's always best to check directly with Apple for any discounts they may be offering, but there are other options as well. Retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart frequently have sales on Apple products, so keeping an eye out for deals at these stores can't hurt.

It's important to note that while this deal may sound too good to be true, it's not a scam or a joke. Apple products typically come with a high price tag, but during these sales, they become much more affordable. That being said, it's always important to purchase from a legitimate retailer to avoid any scams or counterfeit products.

If you've been holding off on purchasing a new laptop due to the cost, now is the perfect time to take the plunge. With these incredible deals on MacBook products, there's no reason not to upgrade. So, what are you waiting for? Head to your nearest retailer or check out Apple's website to get your hands on a MacBook for a fraction of the price. But don't wait too long, because these sales won't last forever.

## Chosen Solution
 I'm selling my MacBook  how can I remove my personal
information (log in & password iTunes account & photos)
mac osx

 IF you're concerned about possibility of someone recovering your deleted data off your disk, even after a simple format, you should do a secure erase of your drive (first reboot from OS install disc then run Disk Utility from the menu). After that, reinstall a clean copy of the OS.
it's also possible to securely erase just the free space on the disk using Disk Utility. you could do that after following what mayer suggested (create a new admin user, delete your old user...) But simply deleting the user directories may still leave some traces of you elsewhere outside the user directories so you're better off doing a full secure erase and reinstall.
otherwise if you're not so concerned, just do a format and reinstall

 Thank u

 I can tell you what the NSA considers a secure wipe:

In that order!  I'm actually not kidding. :)
Cheers!

 Boot from the install disk, reformat the drive and reinstall the operating system.
