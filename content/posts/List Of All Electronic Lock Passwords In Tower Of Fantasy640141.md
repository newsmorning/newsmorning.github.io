The Tower of Fantasy is an exciting game that is designed for adventure seekers. The game takes you through a series of challenges, puzzles, and missions that require you to use your wit and critical thinking skills to progress. One of the most popular challenges in the game is unlocking secret rooms, which have valuable rewards for players. These rooms are locked with electronic locks which require a password to be unlocked. In this article, we’ll take you through a list of electronic lock passwords that will help you unlock every secret room in the Tower of Fantasy.

1. "LlLiveld": This is the password for the electronic lock on the door of the first secret room that most players will encounter. The password is derived from the three pictures hanging on the walls in the room, depicting a lion, a lizard, and a devil.

2. "Soviet": This password is hidden in the tower’s library where players can access books that provide hints on the game’s challenges. Unscramble the letters from the books’ titles to form the word "Soviet" which serves as the password for the second secret room.

3. "Boots": This password is hidden in the woodshop in the game. Just like the Soviet password, unscramble the letters from the titles of the woodshop’s magazines, which form the word “Boots”. The code unlocks the electronic lock on the third secret room.

4. "Phase": The password for the electronic lock on the fourth secret room is hidden in the game’s observatory where players will decipher a secret message. The message reads: “The next stage begins with the phase”. The password is “Phase”.

5. "Frosty": This password is found on a chalkboard in the game’s classrooms. Players need to solve the math equations on the board to unlock the electronic lock of the fifth secret room. The answer to the last equation is “Frosty".

6. "Singer": The password for the electronic lock on the sixth secret room can be found on a piano. Players need to play the five keys in order as seen in the book titled “My Favorite Composers”, where the password is “Singer”.

7. "Nerdy": The password for the electronic lock on the seventh secret room is found in the game’s computing lab. Players have to solve a programming problem to unlock the room. The password is the result of the program, which is “Nerdy”.

In conclusion, unlocking secret rooms is an exciting component of the Tower of Fantasy game. With this list of electronic lock passwords, players can unlock different doors and discover the rewards that await them.
