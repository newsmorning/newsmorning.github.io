Have you ever encountered an issue with your smartphone that seemed to come out of nowhere? Perhaps you had it repaired, and suddenly a new problem arose. This is exactly what happened to one Samsung Galaxy S5 owner, who experienced a major home button malfunction after a simple USB charge port replacement.

The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a popular smartphone model that has been around for several years. It has many advanced features and functions, making it a favorite among tech enthusiasts. Despite its durability, however, the smartphone is not immune to problems. One particular issue that some users face is with the USB charge port, which can become damaged or non-functional over time.

The owner of this Samsung Galaxy S5 thought nothing of getting the USB charge port replaced. After all, it seemed like a simple procedure that would restore the phone's functionality. Unfortunately, things didn't turn out as planned. After the replacement, the home button on the phone stopped working altogether.

The home button on a smartphone is a critical component that allows the user to navigate and interact with the device. Without it, the phone becomes virtually unusable. In this case, the Samsung Galaxy S5 owner was unable to access their apps or make calls, essentially rendering the phone useless.

After some research online, the owner discovered that this was not an uncommon problem. Apparently, many Samsung Galaxy S5 users had experienced the same issue after a USB charge port replacement. The problem stemmed from a tiny connector on the phone's motherboard, which was accidentally damaged during the repair.

Fortunately, there was a solution to the problem. The owner of the Samsung Galaxy S5 contacted a professional repair service that specialized in smartphone repairs. They were able to diagnose the issue and fix it, restoring full functionality to the phone.

In conclusion, it is important to be aware of the potential risks when getting a smartphone repaired. While a seemingly simple procedure like a USB charge port replacement may seem harmless, it can cause unexpected problems like the home button malfunction experienced by this Samsung Galaxy S5 owner. If you do experience a problem after a repair, don't panic. Instead, seek the help of a professional repair service that can diagnose and fix the issue, getting your phone back in working order as quickly as possible.

## Chosen Solution
 My friend has 2 Galaxy S5 phones.  One is a G900A and the other a G900T.  He replaced the USB Charge port on both.  On a GS5, the charge port is on a daughter board which also houses the home button and soft buttons.  For some reason the soft buttons work but on both the home button no longer works.  Even the original ones he had don't work anymore.  I took a look at it, and I couldn't see anything wrong.  I even double checked the iFixit guides.  We also had the seller of the parts resend replacements and bought another from a different source.  All have the same problem.  Does anyone have any idea?

 The home button on the galaxy s5 connects directly to the MB if I remember correctly. Double check the integrity of the board side (female) connector; if the home button got pulled out without being properly unplugged it could be causing the issue.
