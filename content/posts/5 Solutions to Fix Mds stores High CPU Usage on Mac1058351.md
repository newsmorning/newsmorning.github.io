Is your Mac running slow? Are you experiencing high CPU usage due to mds stores? This is a common problem faced by many Mac users, especially those who use their device for heavy tasks such as video editing, gaming, or running multiple applications simultaneously.

Mds stores is a service on your Mac that is responsible for keeping track of all the files on your device. It indexes these files, making it easier for you to search for specific ones. However, sometimes this service can cause high CPU usage, which will slow down your Mac.

In this article, we will explore the five secret solutions to fix mds stores high CPU usage and get your Mac running smoothly again.

## Solution 1: Disable Spotlight Indexing

The first solution to fix mds stores high CPU usage is to disable Spotlight indexing. Spotlight is a service on your Mac that allows you to search for files and folders quickly. However, it can also cause high CPU usage when indexing your files.

To disable Spotlight indexing, go to System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy. Here, click the "+" sign, and add your entire Macintosh HD to the list. This will stop Spotlight from indexing all the files on your device.

## Solution 2: Clear Spotlight Indexing Cache

Another way to fix mds stores high CPU usage is by clearing the Spotlight indexing cache. This will remove all the indexing data that Spotlight has collected, allowing it to start fresh.

To clear the Spotlight indexing cache, go to Finder > Go > Go to Folder. Here, type in "/var/folders" and press Enter. You will see a folder called "com.apple.metadata.mds." Delete this folder and restart your Mac.

## Solution 3: Adjust Spotlight Search Preferences

You can also adjust the Spotlight search preferences to fix mds stores high CPU usage. By default, Spotlight searches for everything on your device, including emails, images, and documents. However, you can specify which folders to exclude from search to reduce the CPU usage.

To adjust the Spotlight search preferences, go to System Preferences > Spotlight. Here, click on the Search Results tab and uncheck the boxes for items you don't want to be searched.

## Solution 4: Repair Disk Permissions

Another solution to fix mds stores high CPU usage is to repair disk permissions. When you install and uninstall programs, it can affect the permissions of files on your device, leading to issues such as high CPU usage.

To repair disk permissions, go to Disk Utility > Select your startup disk > First Aid > Repair Disk Permissions. This will scan your device for any issues and fix them automatically.

## Solution 5: Reset NVRAM/PRAM

Finally, resetting NVRAM/PRAM can also fix mds stores high CPU usage. NVRAM/PRAM stores certain settings on your device, and sometimes, they can cause issues such as high CPU usage.

To reset NVRAM/PRAM, shut down your Mac and press and hold the Command + Option + P + R keys together. Hold them until your Mac restarts, and you hear the startup sound twice. This will reset NVRAM/PRAM and fix any issues that were causing high CPU usage.

In conclusion, mds stores high CPU usage is a common issue faced by many Mac users. However, with these five solutions, you can fix the problem and get your Mac running smoothly again. Try these solutions and see the difference they make!
