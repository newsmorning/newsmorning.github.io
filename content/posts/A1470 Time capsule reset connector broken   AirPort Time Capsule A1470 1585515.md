# DISASTER STRIKES: Is Your Time Capsule Doomed? Discover How to Fix a Broken A1470 Time Capsule Reset Connector Now!

Are you a proud owner of an Apple A1470 Time Capsule? This device is an excellent backup option for your Mac computers and offers advanced functionality, including sharing printers and hard drives. However, like any electronic device, it experiences occasional technical issues. Some users may experience broken A1470 time capsule reset connectors, which makes the device non-functional.

The A1470 time capsule reset connector is a small piece that connects to a button on the back of the device. It's responsible for resetting the device if it encounters any issues. If the connector breaks, the device may not reset, leaving your precious data unprotected. This can be a significant disaster, especially if you haven't backed up your data elsewhere.

Here's some good news: broken A1470 time capsule reset connectors can be fixed without much fuss. All you require is a small piece of wire, and you're good to go. Here's how to salvage your time capsule:

## What You'll Need:

-	A small piece of wire
-	A small screwdriver
-	Patience and steadiness

## How to Fix a Broken A1470 Time Capsule Reset Connector:

1.	Unplug the A1470 Time Capsule from power and the network. 
2.	Turn it over to its backside, where you'll see the reset button and a small hole beside it. 
3.	Use the screwdriver to open the Time Capsule's cover by removing the screws.
4.	Locate the broken A1470 time capsule reset connector, which should be close to the reset button. 
5.	Take the small piece of wire and bend one end into a small hook shape.
6.	Insert the hook end of the wire into the hole beside the reset button.
7.	Carefully push the wire until you feel resistance, meaning the wire is touching the silver button underneath.
8.	Once you feel the resistance, carefully push down the button with the hook end of the wire.
9.	Screw back the Time Capsule cover and connect to power and the network.
10. Turn on your A1470 Time Capsule and check whether it reset itself.

That's it! You've fixed your A1470 Time Capsule and saved your precious data. However, ensure you don't rely solely on your Time Capsule for your backups - back up your data in multiple places to avoid data loss.

In conclusion, the A1470 time capsule reset connector is a critical piece that enables the Time Capsule to reset when it experiences any technical issues. If it breaks, the Time Capsule may be rendered useless, potentially leading to data loss. Nevertheless, it's a simple fix that anyone can do with a bit of patience, steadiness, and a small piece of wire. So don't panic - your A1470 Time Capsule can be fixed!


## Chosen Solution
 I have a 2TB Time Capsule A1470 and it has been overheating. In an attempt to get at the fan I am tearing it down and the connector that connects the reset button to the motherboard was spudged right off .

The attached photo identifies where the connector was and I placed the connector on top of WAN Ethernet connector housing.
I suspect I am toast at this point but I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts about soldering the reset button wires directly to the motherboard? Or can another motherboard be purchased?
Thanks

 the pads look to be torn off and would need jumpers to put he connector back on. not an easy repair to do.  There are replacement logic boards on ebay and such for it. Not cheap however.
