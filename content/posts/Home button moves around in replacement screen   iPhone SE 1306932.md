Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When We Replaced Our iPhone SE Screen - The Home Button Started Playing Hide and Seek!

Have you ever faced a situation where your iPhone screen starts to crack or shatter? And then you finally gather the courage to take it to the repair shop, hoping that the new screen will restore your phone to its original state? 

Well, that's exactly what happened to us. We had an iPhone SE with a cracked screen, which was quite frustrating and inconvenient for our daily use. So, we decided to replace the screen ourselves using a DIY screen replacement kit to save some money.

Although we followed all the instructions closely, and the installation went smoothly, we noticed something peculiar a few days after. The home button on the iPhone started to play hide and seek with us. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't, leaving us frustrated and confused.

After some research and troubleshooting, we found out that the home button issue was a common problem for DIY iPhone screen replacements. The home button, which is attached to the screen, operates using a fingerprint sensor that is registered to a specific iPhone. 

When we replaced the screen, the fingerprint sensor could no longer recognize our fingerprints, causing the home button to malfunction. This meant that we couldn't use the Touch ID feature or even access the multitasking menu directly from the home button.

So, what was the alternative? We had to take our iPhone back to a professional repair shop to re-program the home button's fingerprint sensor, which was quite costly. However, we learned a valuable lesson through this experience. 

DIY screen replacement kits can be convenient and cost-effective, but it comes with its own set of risks and complications. It might seem like a quick fix, but it can lead to more problems if not done correctly, incurring more expenses in the long run.

In conclusion, if you wish to replace your iPhone screen, we recommend going to an authorized repair center or technician. This will not only ensure that the work is executed correctly, but they will also offer a warranty for any inconsistencies that may arise. Save yourself the headache of playing hide-and-seek with your home button and invest in trustworthy and reliable solutions.

## Chosen Solution
 I replaced my iPhone SE screen today with one from iFixit and transferred over my home button. After doing this I have noticed that the home button is extremely wobbly and can be rocked back and forth in its socket. Here is a video of the problem: https://youtu.be/CgWXH91HvW0
I made sure the home button screws were in tight and nothing appears wrong. Is it just an issue with the replacement screen?

 You might need to replace the home button black rubber gasket that sticks onto screen and home button with adhesive.
It's a very common issue when transferring home buttons from one screen to another.
