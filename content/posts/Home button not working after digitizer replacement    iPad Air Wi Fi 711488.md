Title: IPad Air Wi-Fi Users Beware: Digitizer Replacement Can Leave Your Home Button Useless!

Introduction

The IPad Air Wi-Fi has been a popular device for many since its introduction. True enough, it is one of the best models out there for internet browsing, gaming, and streaming, as well as a perfect device for people on the move who require flexibility and convenience. However, there is a severe issue with regards to its digitizer that may come as a surprise to users. The problem is that it may leave your home button useless after replacement. In this article, we will explore this particular issue and discuss how you can avoid it.

What is Digitizer?

Before we delve into the actual problem, let's first understand what the digitizer is. The digitizer is the front part of your IPad's screen that detects finger inputs with its touch function. It is easy to confuse it as the actual screen, but it is an essential part of it. The digitizer is responsible for the touch function of your IPad, and it needs to be functional to have any input on the device.

What is the Issue with Digitizer Replacement?

When you have a problem with your IPad's digitizer, you would need to replace it in most cases. However, what most people don't know is that replacement of your faulty digitizer can also disable your home button. Why is this so? The IPad Air Wi-Fi has a built-in security feature called touch ID, and the home button is an essential part of that feature. When the digitizer is replaced in some cases, it may not retain recognition of your home button ID, and therefore your home button would become unusable. This issue can be very frustrating, especially if you use your IPad for critical functions that require its home button.

How to Avoid the Issue?

Fortunately, there is a way to avoid the problem when it comes to replacing your digitizer. If you ever need to replace your device's digitizer, it is essential to hire a professional technician. Hiring an expert will ensure that the digitizer is replaced correctly and that the security feature of your IPad Air Wi-Fi is not compromised. However, if you're not in a position to change your digitizer professionally, there is a workaround to preserve your home button function. Before you remove the home button assembly, ensure that the touch ID is disabled in the settings of your device. After you have completed your replacement, you can then re-enable touch ID to reactivate your home button.

Conclusion

The IPad Air Wi-Fi is an indispensable device for many, thanks to its versatility and convenience. However, digitizer replacement can cause problems to its home button, leaving users helpless. The solution lies in being careful when handling your device and hiring a professional if the need ever arises. Alternatively, you can use the workaround provided in this article to preserve the function of the home button. Remember, taking good care of your device will ensure it serves you for a long time without any complications.

## Chosen Solution
 Cut the cable removing the old screen, but had one on hand just in case. Installed, didn't work. Assumed it was defective, ordered another. Also doesn't work. No visible damage anywhere. whats going on??

 I agree with Mark’s good advice. You could also just check to make sure that the connector end of the flex is not smudged by oil residue from your fingers. This can also be enough to keep it from making contact. Clean the contact with alcohol and then try it again.
If that doesn’t do it, you can always replace the home button assembly and flex. I’m sure you can find the parts here on iFixit.
