In recent years, virtual assistant apps have become a crucial part of our daily lives. These apps assist us in handling tasks such as scheduling appointments, making phone calls, and setting alarms. When it comes to operating system-based virtual assistants, Cortana has been the go-to choice for Windows users for some time. However, this is no longer the case as other virtual assistant apps are now outsmarting Cortana and taking over Windows 10 and 11. 

If you are looking for an alternative to Cortana, look no further. Here are five virtual assistant apps that are taking the Windows ecosystem by storm: 

## 1. Amazon Alexa

Amazon Alexa is a virtual assistant app that was initially designed for Amazon's Echo devices. However, Alexa has made its way onto the Windows ecosystem and is gradually taking over Cortana. It operates using voice commands and can perform tasks such as setting reminders, playing music, and providing weather updates. 

One of the significant advantages of Alexa is its integration with Amazon's vast ecosystem. This integration enables users to control their smart home devices from their PC by merely giving voice commands to their Alexa-powered virtual assistant.

## 2. Google Assistant

Google Assistant is another virtual assistant that has been taking the world by storm. It was initially developed for Google's Android devices but is now making its way onto the Windows ecosystem. Like Alexa, Google Assistant operates via voice commands and can perform tasks such as setting alarms, making phone calls, and sending text messages. 

Google Assistant's major advantage is its ability to integrate with Google's vast ecosystem of apps and services. This integration provides users with a seamless experience while using Google's various apps and tools.

## 3. Siri

Siri is an AI-powered virtual assistant developed by Apple for its iOS devices. However, it is now making its way onto the Windows ecosystem. Like other virtual assistants, Siri operates using voice commands and can perform tasks such as setting alarms, making phone calls, and sending text messages. 

Siri's significant advantage is its integration with the other Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads and Macs. This integration provides users with a seamless experience while using Apple's ecosystem of devices and services.

## 4. Watson Assistant

Watson Assistant is an AI-powered virtual assistant developed by IBM. It operates via text and voice commands and can perform tasks such as making phone calls, sending text messages, and setting appointments. 

One of the major advantages of Watson Assistant is its ability to integrate with IBM's Watson AI platform. This integration provides users with access to a vast array of AI-powered tools, enabling them to perform complex tasks easily.

## 5. Bixby

Bixby is an AI-powered virtual assistant developed by Samsung. Initially developed for its smartphones, Bixby has made its way onto the Windows ecosystem. Like other virtual assistants, Bixby operates using voice commands and can perform tasks such as setting alarms, making phone calls, and sending text messages. 

One of the significant advantages of Bixby is its integration with Samsung's vast ecosystem of devices and services. This integration provides users with a seamless experience while using Samsung's various apps and tools.

In conclusion, Cortana's reign as the go-to virtual assistant for Windows users has started to wane. These five virtual assistant apps are gradually taking over the Windows ecosystem, and with their vast ecosystems of devices and services, it's easy to see why. So, if you are in search of an alternative to Cortana, give one of these apps a try, and you won't be disappointed.

Apple’s Siri was among the first digital assistants for mobiles and tablets, and Microsoft included its first virtual assistant in Windows 10 and Phone 8.1. Cortana is Windows 10’s virtual assistant, and that can keep a notebook for you, send emails, tell you the time in various countries, replace the Calculator app, provide football scores and fixtures, set alarms, play songs with apps, schedule dates, etc. Although it might seem little more than a search tool at first, Cortana is a lot more. However, you can still try out any of these alternative third-party virtual assistants for various Windows platforms.
 
### Braina
 
Braina is virtual assistant software that has a freeware Lite and proprietary Pro version, which is retailing at $29. With the Lite version you can save notes, set alarms and reminders, open programs and files, open websites, play songs, get weather details and search web. The software is also a handy dictionary and thesaurus. However, the Pro version can do quite a bit more and enables users to dictate speech to text for word processing, make Skype calls, set up hotkeys to trigger custom commands, create keyboard macros and establish startup commands that automatically execute when you first open Braina.
 
### Jarvis Light
 

Jarvis Lite is freeware you can add to Windows by pressing the Download Now button on its home page. This application has minimal system requirements, so it’s a good choice for more outdated laptops or desktops. With Jarvis Lite’s shell commands users can launch software, shut down Windows, play songs, open and send emails and open web pages. The software’s termination commands come in handy for closing programs and windows. In addition, Jarvis enables speech to text dictation and provides handy audio controls; and you can also set up custom voice commands with it.
 
### Denise
 

Denise is VA software available for $120, and there’s no stripped down freeware version. However, the software might still be well worth it as it comes with a unique set of avatars and a GUI that Cortana can’t match. Denise has male, female and robot avatars within a real-time display system with millions of colors. Users can resize the avatars to alternative resolutions and customize the UI’s menu options.

Syn opens programs and websites, manages contacts, checks email and plays media. The software also supports Visual Basic, C++ and C# plug-ins so that developers can further enhance it.
