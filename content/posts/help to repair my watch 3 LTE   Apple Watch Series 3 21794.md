## Chosen Solution
 hello, i tried to fix my apple watch. but I accidently harmed to two sections.-first one is behind the screen, yellow marked, must be a tape, right? I hope. if it is, it will be no problem.- second one is I broke some antenna, red marked.  Can I use my watch without it? if not, where can I get spare parts or glue them?

 Its hard to say what the  first picture is pointing at but it seems that youâ€™re referring to the Force Touch gasket ? Ifixit sells the spare part. As for the second picture , luckily its just copper tape.
