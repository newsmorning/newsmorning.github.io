Unleash the Secret Power of Magic Damage in Loop Hero - Learn all the Tricks in Just One Click!

Magic damage is a powerful force in Loop Hero, but many players fail to utilize its full potential. This type of damage can be devastating against certain enemies, especially those with high physical defenses. In this article, we will explore the secrets of magic damage and teach you how to use it effectively in Loop Hero.

First, it's important to understand the different types of magic damage. There are three main types: fire, frost, and lightning. Each has its own unique properties and can be used in different ways. Fire damage, for example, can set enemies on fire, dealing damage over time. Frost damage can slow enemies down, making it easier to defeat them. Lightning damage can hit multiple enemies at once, dealing high damage to each.

Once you understand the types of magic damage, it's important to know how to build your deck to take advantage of it. Magic damage cards tend to have lower attack values than physical damage cards, but they make up for it with their special effects. Cards like Necromancer or Vampire Mansion can summon creatures that deal magical damage, while Mana Crystal and Magic Lantern can increase the amount of damage dealt.

Another trick is to combine physical and magical damage. This way, you can take advantage of enemies with weak physical defenses, while still being able to deal damage to those with high physical defenses. For example, the Golden Armor card can increase your physical damage, while the Battlefield, which has a fire aura, can deal fire damage to all enemies on the field.

Finally, don't forget about the importance of gear. Magic damage is heavily dependent on your hero's intelligence stat, so make sure you're equipping items that boost it. Items like Ring of Mana or Elemental Bead can give you a big boost in magic damage.

In conclusion, magic damage is a powerful weapon in your battle against the Loop Hero's many enemies. By understanding the different types of magic damage and how to build your deck around them, you can unleash a devastating barrage of attacks. So what are you waiting for? Start experimenting with magic damage today and see what wonders you can achieve!

The placement and tile combinations can turn the tides against you or in your favor. Among all the stats you must know about the game, there’s something called Magic Damage. What does Magic Damage do in Loop Hero? We’ve explained how it works in this guide.
 
## What is Magic Damage in Loop Hero and How Does it Work?
 

 
The Magic Damage stat increases the damage dealt by your character. Some enemies like Skeletons and Blood Clot especially require Magic Damage to kill them easily. Note that you can pick up this stat by killing enemies and you can use it against those who have a high defense stat.
 
For example, players note that they were able to kill a Ghost much easily with Magic damage. It also ignores monster armor. Warrior and Rogue classes can make use of this type of damage against enemies.
 
In terms of Tiles, Burned Forests give you +0.5 Magic Damage which will add up on your base damage. You can create a Burned Forest when you put a Storm Temple right next to a Forest or a Thicket.
 
So, that was the basic idea of what does Magic Damage do in Loop Hero. There are other stats that you can also focus on like Vampirism. And if you are curious to know how to get various resources like Astral Orb, Orb of Expansion, Orb of Unity and more, check out our Loop Hero guides right away.
