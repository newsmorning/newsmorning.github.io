Uncover the Secret Techniques to Finally Squash All Mafia Definitive Edition Bugs on PC, Xbox, and PS4!

Mafia Definitive Edition is a spectacular remake of the 2002 classic game. It offers players an immersive experience, taking them back to the gritty and dangerous streets of Lost Heaven. However, like any other game, there are some bugs and glitches that players may encounter, which can affect their gameplay experience.

In this article, we will uncover the secret techniques to finally squash all Mafia Definitive Edition bugs on PC, Xbox, and PS4.

1. Update your Game

The first step in fixing any bug in Mafia Definitive Edition is updating your game. Developers often release patches that address various bugs and glitches in the game. So, make sure to install the latest update before trying any other methods.

To update the game on PS4 or Xbox, go to the game's main menu and select "Options". From there, select "Check for Updates," and if an update is available, install it. On PC, open the game launcher and check for the latest patch.

2. Verify Game Files

If updating the game doesn't solve the bug, the next step is to verify the game files. This will ensure that all the game files are complete and not corrupt.

On PS4 and Xbox, press the "Options" button on the game's icon from the main menu and select "Check for corrupted data." On PC, right-click on the game in your library, select "Properties," click on the "Local Files" tab, and then click on "Verify Integrity of Game Files."

3. Decrease your Graphics Settings

If your game is still experiencing bugs, try decreasing your graphics settings. This will take the load off your system and may help to fix any performance-related issues.

On PS4 and Xbox, select "Options" from the game's main menu, and then select "Video." From there, you can adjust the graphics settings. On PC, you can do this from the game's launcher or settings menu.

4. Disable Antivirus Program

Antivirus programs can sometimes interfere with games, causing bugs and glitches. Try disabling your Antivirus program temporarily to see if it solves the issue.

On PC, you can temporarily disable your Antivirus program by right-clicking on the program icon in the taskbar and selecting "Disable." Make sure to enable it again once you're done playing.

Conclusion

Mafia Definitive Edition is undoubtedly a stunning game, but like any other, it has its bugs and glitches. By following these secret techniques, you can finally squash all these bugs and enjoy the game to its fullest on PC, Xbox, and PS4. So, get back to the mafia world and experience the thrill of the game without any interruptions!

Not only was it a complete remake from the ground up of the 2002 game that bears the same name, but it came with the same story and mechanics, but with 2020 technology powering it.
 
However, everyone remembers how Mafia II Definitive Edition faired, and how riddled with bugs it was. Well, Mafia: Definitive Edition seems to be not too far away in that department.
 
The issues found by players so far are not too many, and we will be listing them all below, along with solutions for each of them wherever they were available.
 
## What are the most frequent issues in the Mafia remake?
 
- An excellent remake of a classic.
 - Experience a breathtaking cityscape.
 - Realistic recreation of Prohibition-era USA.
 - Plenty of Trophies and easter eggs to collect.

 
- You need a beefy PC to run it

 
### 1. Game locked 60 Hz on 144hz screen
 
Many PC owners reported that their game lacks a refresh rate option in-game, only a resolution selector.
 
Additionally, it seems that their monitor can only run at 60 Hz inside the game, which can be frustrating for those that have powerful gaming monitors.
 
Solutions:
 
You can try disabling fullscreen optimizations on the .exe’s file properties.
 
It seems that setting the game to Windowed mode, then enabling borderless gameplay fixes the issue, albeit it is mostly a workaround.
 
If you own the Steam version of Mafia: Definitive Edition, you can launch the game in windowed mode by following these steps.
 
### 2. Mafia Definitive Edition doesn’t support HDR on PC
 
Many players were reported that they were disappointed to see that Mafia: Definitive Edition lacked a High-Dynamic Range option despite it being a feature heavily marketed in the promotional material.
 
Additionally, they were disappointed to learn that their console counterparts didn’t have this issue.
 
Unfortunately, there is no current solution to this problem available. As such, simply wait until a new patch fix is available and try running it again.
 
### 3. Mafia: Definitive Edition black screens
 
This particular issue seems to be targeting Steam users more than Epic Games users, and it is pretty self-explanatory: the game always launches with a black screen hang.
 
Steam users stated that it didn’t matter whether they launched the game with or without the launcher, they would still be getting a black screen hang.
 
Unfortunately, no one is currently aware of why this issue happens, and your only choice so far is to just wait until some patch fixes are released.
 
### 4. Random freezes
 
Many players have reported that under certain conditions, they would experience game freezes when entering new vehicles.
 
This issue is pretty common, as many other users said that they were experiencing the same issues. They all have different system specs, and this happened to both Epic games and the Steam versions of the game.
 
[…] in my case, the game doesn’t stutter much but occasionally freezes for a minute or two, it’s damn irritating.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.

Unfortunately, no one is currently aware of why this issue happens. that being said, players will need to wait until the game gets patched.
 
### 5. Randomly spawning NPCs
 
As you can see from this GIF posted on Reddit, NPCs have a tendency to spawn randomly at times. This can be extremely frustrating, especially if, like in the case of the GIF, this happens during a firefight, as they can block your line of sight.
 
Unfortunately, this type of issue is related strictly to the game’s coding and has nothing to do with the user’s installation or hardware.
 
As such, a patch fix is the only solution.
 
### 6. Issues with pre-loading Mafia: Definitive Edition
 
### 
 
This particular bug targets Xbox One users, and it is mostly an inconvenience.
 
Many users reported that they are having difficulties pre-loading Mafia: Definitive Edition, especially if they have some of the previous titles in their gaming libraries.
 
This is not necessarily a bug related to the game itself, but rather the way your console’s game store handles game purchases.
 
For example, a lot of times right after you buy a game it starts auto-downloading, but this may not always be the case.
 
If you purchased Mafia: Definitive Edition and it didn’t pre-load, go to your Ready to install list and check if it’s there.
 
### 7. Mafia Trilogy PS4 owners find Mafia: D.E. at the end of the results
 
A PlayStation 4-exclusive bug and it is more of an inconvenience than a game breaker, users reported that if you already own the trilogy in your gaming library, searching for Mafia: Definitive Edition will make it appear at the end of your searches.
 
This is a bug since usually any game you would be looking for would be among the first results, especially if you already own entries from that franchise or series
 
Additionally, those that own Mafia 1 reported that Mafia: Definitive Edition is labeled as unavailable for purchase.
 
According to users, there is a workaround that they can try:
 
That pretty much wraps up our list of common bugs and issues found in Mafia: Definitive Edition. However, keep in mind that the games have barely been launched and that new bugs are bound to appear.
 
Be sure to search for mafia definitive edition and select the option that does not say “pre-order” afterward, there are two options for some reason.
 
It will ask you to “choose version” asking you to pick to pay for the game or to pick “free”, obviously choose free and boom, workaround.
 
Patches are sure to come as well, and we’ll be updating this list with both issues and solutions as they appear, so stay tuned.
