# Desperate Smartphone Lovers Rejoice: Latest Motorola Moto G7 Play Teardown is NOT on iFixit - Find Out Why!

Are you one of those smartphone lovers who can't wait to get their hands on the latest devices? Do you love to tinker with your gadgets to see what makes them tick? Then you'll be delighted to hear that the Motorola Moto G7 Play has just been released – and that its inner workings are not yet available on iFixit!

As you may know, iFixit is a popular website that publishes teardown guides for a wide range of electronic devices, allowing users to see how they work and learn how to repair them. However, the latest Motorola Moto G7 Play is not listed among their teardown guides just yet.

The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it could be because Motorola has made it harder to take the device apart. As Gizmodo reported, the Moto G7 Play appears to be "fused together" using what they called "concealed clamps" that are "difficult to remove without some specialized tools."

This is not entirely surprising, as manufacturers have been making it harder to repair their devices in recent years. This trend has been criticized by both consumers and repair professionals, who argue that it is wasteful and harms the environment.

But while it may be frustrating for those who like to peek under the hood, there are some positives to this approach. For one thing, it means that the Moto G7 Play is likely to be more durable, as it is less likely to come apart accidentally. It also means that the device is less likely to suffer from water damage, as there are fewer places for moisture to enter.

Of course, there are always going to be those who want to see what the device looks like on the inside – and that's where the "specialized tools" mentioned by Gizmodo come in. For those who are brave enough to attempt it, there are various teardown guides and videos available online that offer a glimpse into the Moto G7 Play's inner workings.

Ultimately, whether you are a keen gadget tinkerer or just a regular smartphone user, the Motorola Moto G7 Play is likely to be an enticing device. With its sleek design, reasonable price tag, and impressive specs, it offers a lot for its users to love. And with its difficult-to-teardown design, it may even prove to be more durable over the long run. It remains to be seen whether iFixit will publish a teardown guide for the device, but in the meantime, there are sure to be plenty of users exploring its inner workings on their own.
