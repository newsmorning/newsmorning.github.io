Title: How Rain Bird ESP 6TM Owners Can Achieve Perfect Program Start Times

As a Rain Bird ESP 6TM owner, have you ever struggled to achieve perfect program start times for your sprinkler system? It can be frustrating when your lawn is either under- or over-watered, and you can't seem to figure out why. However, there is a secret that many Rain Bird ESP 6TM owners have discovered that can help achieve optimal program start times. Are you ready to learn this secret?

The secret to achieving perfect program start times for the Rain Bird ESP 6TM is to sync the programmed start times with real-time weather data. This may sound complicated, but it's actually quite simple. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Install a weather sensor on your property. This can be purchased separately from Rain Bird or from a third-party vendor. The sensor should be installed in a location that receives ample sunlight and away from any obstructions. It will wirelessly transmit weather data to your Rain Bird ESP 6TM controller.

Step 2: Once you have installed your weather sensor, you will need to access your Rain Bird ESP 6TM controller's programming menu. From there, select the "Weather" option and follow the prompts to connect your weather sensor to your controller.

Step 3: Once your Rain Bird ESP 6TM controller is connected to your weather sensor, it will automatically adjust your sprinkler program start times based on current weather conditions. If it is raining or there is a chance of precipitation, the controller will delay its scheduled start times until the weather clears up. If it is particularly hot and dry, the program start times will be adjusted to water more frequently and for a longer duration.

This allows for a more customized, efficient watering schedule that is tailored to your unique lawn conditions. No more guessing or manual adjustments - the Rain Bird ESP 6TM will do the work for you!

By connecting your Rain Bird ESP 6TM controller to a weather sensor, you can experience a finer level of control over your sprinkler system that can help save water and money. Plus, you can be confident that your lawn is receiving the exact amount of water it needs, no matter the weather.

In conclusion, if you own a Rain Bird ESP 6TM and are struggling to achieve perfect program start times, consider installing a weather sensor and syncing it with your controller. This simple step can revolutionize the way you water your lawn, and you won't believe the difference it can make!

## Chosen Solution
 Iâ€™m trying to blank out all of the program start times but one. How the !&&* do you do it. The manual is a joke.

 Hi,
If you have a Rainbird ESP-6TM, then to  eliminate  a  start  time, select a watering start time and then press the  Up or Down arrow until the blank setting  between 11:45 PM  and 12:15 AM appears.
Make sure the program you want appears in the display.  Either "PGM  A" or "PGM  B" will appear. To switch to the other program, press the A / B (or PGM) button.
