iPhone 5 Owners are Going Crazy Over their Home Button Malfunction! Find Out the Shocking Reason Behind this Common Issue!

If you are an iPhone 5 owner, you might be experiencing a frustrating issue with your device’s home button. Many iPhone 5 users are complaining that their home button is not working or is becoming unresponsive. This problem has become so common that it has led to numerous online discussions and social media posts from frustrated iPhone 5 owners.

The reason behind this common issue is not what you might think. It’s not a mechanical problem or a defect in the device. Instead, it is a software issue that is affecting iPhone 5 models running on iOS 10.3.4 or earlier versions. The issue occurs when the device’s internal clock becomes out of sync, which makes the device's security features malfunction. This, in turn, causes the home button to stop working or become unresponsive.

So, why is the internal clock getting out of sync? The answer lies in the GPS time rollover issue that occurred on April 6th, 2019. The GPS time rollover is a known issue that affects some GPS devices every 19.7 years when the GPS week number rolls over. This issue also affected iPhone 5 devices running on iOS 10.3.4 or earlier versions.

How Can You Fix the Home Button Issue?

If you are experiencing this issue with your iPhone 5, don’t panic! There is a simple solution that you can follow to fix the problem.

Step 1: Update Your iPhone 5

The first step is to update your iPhone 5 to the latest version of iOS. Apple has released a software update that fixes the GPS time rollover issue in iOS 10.3.4 and earlier versions. You can update your iPhone 5 by going to Settings > General > Software Update.

Step 2: Reset Your iPhone 5

If updating your iPhone 5 doesn’t fix the home button issue, you can try resetting your device. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings. This will reset your device's settings to their default settings, which should fix any software issues that are causing the home button malfunction.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you are experiencing a home button malfunction issue with your iPhone 5, it’s not a mechanical or hardware problem. Instead, it’s a software issue caused by the GPS time rollover issue. By following the simple steps mentioned above, you can fix the home button issue and restore your iPhone 5 to its full functionality.

## Chosen Solution
 I've replaced the flex cable but still not working

 The problem is with the charging port as it powers the home button with two gold prongs open up phone and you will see the gold prongs below the home button flex..
Away of test if the charging port is at fault is open up leaving phone on and not taking screen off now with a screw driver touch the two gold prongs at the same time this will short the phone to think you are pressing the home button if screen lights up then the charging port is ok.. If it doesn't you need to replace port..
Benting the gold prongs upwards a tad might work also as they might not be making contact with the home flex.. Hope this helps

 I think you may have purchased an iphone 5s  charge port flex. A proper iphone 5 charge port flex should have the part attached.

Where the 2 parts are being separated(on the flex so the left one) is where the prong component should be.  An iphone 5s charge port flex will look nearly identical but will be missing the part you need.
