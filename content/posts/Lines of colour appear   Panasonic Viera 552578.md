Body:
Viera's technology uses highly advanced equipment to create lines of color that move around the screen. It may sound like a simple gimmick, but it is actually quite mesmerizing. The colors are vivid and bright, while the lines themselves move in perfect sync with the sound and visuals on the screen. This creates an immersive viewing experience that is unlike anything else on the market.

The technology also allows for the creation of multiple lines of color, each with its own unique movement and tone. This allows for a much more dynamic and exciting visual experience. Whether you are watching a fast-paced action movie or a slow and contemplative drama, Viera's lines of color will add an extra level of depth and texture to the visuals.

Furthermore, Viera's technology is not just limited to TVs - it can also be used by content creators to enhance their work. The lines of color can be integrated into films, TV shows, and video games, creating a more engaging and immersive experience for audiences.

But what really sets Viera apart is its ability to adapt to different viewing situations. With adjustable settings for brightness, contrast, and motion, the technology can be fine-tuned to fit any environment. This means that whether you are watching TV in a brightly-lit living room or a dark home theater, you can always enjoy the full capabilities of the technology.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Panasonic's Viera technology is a game-changer in the world of television. Its lines of color create a dynamic and exciting visual experience that will keep you engaged no matter what you are watching. It is a must-see for anyone who loves immersive visuals and exciting technology. So, if you are looking to upgrade your viewing experience, be sure to check out Panasonic Viera's new innovation and see how it can make lines of color dance before your very eyes.

## Chosen Solution
 I accidentally threw the control at the TV so where it hit there's crack with coloured lines when I turn on the TV but turn it off, itâ€™s completely intact. I might consider hitting my TV on the spot it was damaged since people did that on YouTube.

this sounds very much like a broken LCD screen. Post some images to verify this, with your question. Use this guide Adding images to an existing question for that.
If it is then there is no repair for it. You will have to try to find a new LCD panel for your TV.
