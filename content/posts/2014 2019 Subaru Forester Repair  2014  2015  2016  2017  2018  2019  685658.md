If you're in the market for a used vehicle, you want to be sure you're getting a reliable car. One car that often appears on lists of the most reliable used vehicles is the Subaru Forester. But even with its reputation for reliability, every car has its issues. Today, we'll take a look at the repair history of the 2014-2019 Subaru Forester to see what common problems the car has and how to avoid them.

One issue that has been reported in this model year range is excessive oil consumption. Subaru issued a Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) addressing this problem for the 2014-2016 models, but some drivers have reported it in later model years as well. The problem seems to be related to the engine's piston rings, which can wear out prematurely and cause oil to be burned off faster than normal. If you're considering buying a 2014-2019 Forester, it's important to check the car's maintenance records to see if this issue has been addressed.

Another issue that has been reported by some drivers is with the headlights. Some drivers have reported that the headlights, particularly the low beams, are too weak and do not illuminate the road properly. This problem can be addressed by upgrading to brighter bulbs or adjusting the aim of the headlights. If you're buying a 2014-2019 Forester, be sure to check the headlights during your test drive and ask the seller if they have had any issues with them.

One issue that has affected some 2014-2018 Foresters is a problem with the windshield wipers. Some drivers have reported that the wipers stop working intermittently or just stop altogether. This issue has been attributed to a faulty windshield wiper motor, which needs to be replaced. If you're buying a Forester from this model year range, be sure to test the wipers during your test drive and ask the seller if they have had any issues with them.

Finally, some 2019 Foresters have been reported to have issues with the transmission. Some drivers have reported that the car will jerk or hesitate when accelerating from a stop or while driving at low speeds. This problem has been attributed to a faulty transmission control module, which needs to be replaced. If you're buying a 2019 Forester, be sure to test drive the car thoroughly and listen for any unusual sounds or sensations while accelerating.

In summary, while the 2014-2019 Subaru Forester is generally a reliable car, there are a few issues you should be aware of if you're considering buying one. The most important thing you can do is to check the car's maintenance records and ask the seller about any problems they've had with the car. By doing your research and being a savvy buyer, you can avoid these common problems and enjoy a reliable, comfortable car for years to come.
