Introduction
If you have recently replaced the battery of your iPhone 6S and are experiencing issues with your home button not working, you are not alone. Many people have reported this problem after replacing their battery, and the reason behind this issue is quite insane.

Background
Apple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices were manufactured with faulty batteries, which caused the devices to shut down unexpectedly. As a result, the company offered a battery replacement program to eligible customers.

However, after getting their batteries replaced, some users found that their home button wasn't working. This issue sparked discussions and numerous complaints on forums, and many people were wondering what was going wrong.

The Insane Reason
The reason behind the home button not working after a battery replacement is related to a key feature of the iPhone 6S: the Touch ID sensor. The Touch ID sensor reads and recognizes fingerprints to unlock the device or to make in-app purchases.

During the battery replacement process, the Touch ID sensor is disconnected from the mainboard. This is a security feature designed to prevent unauthorized access to your device. When the battery is replaced, the sensor must be recalibrated to function correctly again.

However, Apple's security policies prohibit third-party repair shops from recalibrating Touch ID sensors. The only way to recalibrate it is to replace the whole home button with a new one, which can only be done in an official Apple store.

Consequently, if the home button is damaged during the battery replacement process, or if it's not working due to other reasons, you can only get it fixed by Apple. This can be a frustrating experience for users, especially those who have to travel long distances to get to an official Apple store.

Conclusion
If you have recently replaced the battery of your iPhone 6S and your home button is not working, it's probably due to the Touch ID sensor not being calibrated. The only solution to this problem is to replace the home button, and this can only be done by an authorized Apple repair store. This issue highlights the importance of choosing a reliable and certified repair shop if you need to repair your iPhone. Otherwise, you might end up with a bricked device after spending money on a battery replacement.

## Chosen Solution
 Following the iFixit battery replacement guide, I did a battery replacement a few months ago. After the battery replacement, my home button stopped working. It doesn’t register any presses and neither does Touch ID work.
My friend was doing a screen replacement on his 6S and it came with a home button. He intended on keeping his original home button, so I had asked if I could have his spare home button. However, when I installed the home button, it still did not work.
Now here’s where I think I went wrong. In the iFixit battery replacement guide, you are asked to separate the display assembly from the rest of the phone. While this step is not necessary, it would make life much easier when working on the rest of the phone.
There are 3 cables connecting the display assembly to the phone: the front camera cable, the digitizer cable,  and the display cable.
I’m not sure which of these cables register home button presses, but I think I may have damaged that cable. Anyone have any other opinions as to what could be causing my home button to stop working after a battery replacement?

 I would suggest going back and opening up the phone checking all the connections and check all of the pins were put back right and that they are not bent.
