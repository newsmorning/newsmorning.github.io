If you are the owner of an Acer Aspire V3 771G, you might have experienced the frustration of it not turning on. This can happen at any time, whether the laptop is brand new or has been in use for a while.

The reasons why this might happen can be numerous, and troubleshooting can be daunting for those who are not tech-savvy. However, in this article, we will provide you with some possible reasons why this might happen and what you can do to fix it.

1. The Battery is Dead

One of the most common reasons why laptops fail to turn on is because the battery is dead. In the case of the Acer Aspire V3 771G, this might be because the battery is old and has lost its charge capacity. If this is the case, replacing the battery is the best solution.

To check if the battery is the problem, use your laptop while plugged in. If it works fine when plugged in, but refuses to start when unplugged, then the battery is most likely the culprit.

2. The Adapter is Faulty

An inadequate adapter can also cause your laptop to fail to power up. The Acer Aspire V3 771G requires a 19V adapter with a minimum power output of 90W. If you are using an adapter with a lower rating, this might cause problems.

To check if the adapter is faulty, connect a different adapter with the correct rating to your laptop and try to start it. If it turns on, then you know that your old adapter was the problem.

3. The Power Button is Malfunctioning

Another possible reason for your Acer Aspire V3 771G failing to turn on could be due to a dysfunctional power button. Over time, the button might get stuck or not make proper contact, causing it to fail.

To check if this is the case, try pressing the power button multiple times, or use an external keyboard to turn on your laptop. If it turns on using the keyboard, then you know that the power button needs replacement.

4. The Laptop is Overheating

Overheating is another factor that can cause laptops to refuse to turn on. The Acer Aspire V3 771G is designed with an internal cooling system that should prevent excess heating. However, if the laptop generates too much heat due to overuse, it might shut down to protect its circuitry.

To fix this, ensure that your laptop is placed on a flat surface that allows for proper ventilation. You can also use a cooling pad to help regulate the temperature of your laptop.

Conclusion

In conclusion, laptops can fail to turn on for various reasons, and troubleshooting can be daunting, especially for those who are not tech-savvy. However, if you own an Acer Aspire V3 771G and it refuses to turn on, these are the most common problems and solutions that you can try.

It is always best to consult with the manufacturer or a professional technician if the problem persists, to avoid causing more damage to your laptop.


## Chosen Solution
 Recap: Acer  Laptop won't turn on , AC Lamp is off even while the laptop is plugged  in, it only turns on for like 1 sec when I press the power button while  plugged in then turns off , BUT the Battery power lamp is blue while  plugged in. Already tried holding down the power button 30sec
————————————————-
Okay, I should preface this with the fact that I am not the most well versed in how these things work, so I will do my best to explain.
I have an Acer Aspire V3-772G-747a8G1TMakk. I don't know what specs you might need, so here is everything I can read on the sticker:
-Windows 8.1
-intel core i7-3517U, 1.9 GHz
-8GB of RAM
-Intel QuadCore i7 4702MQ, 4x2,20GHz
It ran great, had no problems for 3 years then I replaced the HDD when it started to show signs of failure and added an extra SSD in the empty slot...it ran smoothly for an extra 6 months , until today , yesterday it was still working like a charm...I put it to hibernate mode/sleep it and today it just wouldn't turn back on.
Plugged out: When I press the power button neither the AC lamp nor the Battery lamp turn on .
Plugged In with the battery: When I tried pressing the power button the AC Lamp turned on for half a second then turned back off. I could hear a faint high pitched noise (not coming from the speakers) , the fan didnt start whirling neither did the Screen turn on. The Battery Lamp which was blue , meaning connected but not in charge, promptly turns off while I press the power button, then turns back on ( I must say the battery is pretty much dead, I only keep it so that in case of a power outage I have a few seconds to save my data, but yeah it's pretty much useless)
Then I removed the battery, unplugged the power cable and held the power button for 30 secs- 1 minute
Plugged in , without the battery: AC Lamp turns blue for a short while then turns back off again, without anything starting to boot.
What I have tried:
-Repeating holding down the power button several times
-Using a different Acer power cord
-Unplugging and trying, plugging it back in and trying. All variations of taking out and putting back in the battery and trying to turn it on.
That is pretty much the end of my expertise level...
HALP? :(

 try taking it to best buy and see what they say
