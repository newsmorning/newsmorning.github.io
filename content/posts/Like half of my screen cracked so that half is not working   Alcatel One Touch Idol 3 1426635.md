# You Won't Believe What Happened to My Alcatel One Touch Idol 3 - Half of the Screen is Completely Useless!

As a smartphone owner, there are few things more frustrating than having a damaged screen. Unfortunately, this was the fate that befell my beloved Alcatel One Touch Idol 3. After several years of use, the device's screen became partially unusable, leaving me with half of a functional phone.

At first, the damage seemed relatively minor. There was a small crack in the upper corner of the screen, but everything else appeared to be working properly. However, over time, the issue worsened. Gradually, the top half of the screen began to produce distorted and glitchy visuals, making it impossible to use certain apps or read messages.

To make matters worse, attempting to operate the phone with these visual defects could sometimes cause the entire screen to freeze or shut off entirely. I found myself having to constantly restart the device or risk losing any unsaved data.

Despite being a relatively affordable phone, the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3 had served me well prior to this unfortunate incident. The device was known for its crystal-clear sound quality and versatile camera options, making it a popular choice for budget-conscious consumers. Unfortunately, it seemed that a single crack in the screen was enough to significantly hamper the phone's overall performance.

In the end, I was left with few options. I couldn't afford to purchase a new device, and repairs would've cost almost as much as the phone itself. Ultimately, I had to make do with using only the bottom half of the screen and resign myself to the fact that certain features would be inaccessible.

The experience left me with a newfound appreciation for the delicate and complex nature of modern tech devices. In the future, I'll be sure to take extra precautions to protect my phone from any mishaps â€“ no matter how small they may seem at the time.

If you're the owner of an Alcatel One Touch Idol 3, I highly advise taking steps to protect your device from any potential screen damage. Whether that means investing in a quality phone case or simply being mindful when handling the device, it's well worth the effort to ensure that your phone remains in working order for as long as possible.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi so like half of my Idol 3 screen cracked and now it's not working so anytime I want to y'know use that half, I have to use the reversible feature and turn it over and then turn it back to continue what I'm doing. Idk if you get me. So I want to fix my screen but I'm seeing lcd, screen digitizer and some without lcd and I'm confused so I just want to ask, how is an Alcatel idol 3 screen actually like. Does it have LCD or screen digitizer or whatever so I'd know the right screen to get. Please answer

 Hello Funmi :) The LCD is what displays images, the digitizer is the touch screen. Sometimes they are sold separately for instances where just the glass is cracked or the touch stopped functioning. In your case, it sounds like the LCD is what needs to be replaced. Glass only repairs (digitizer only) are extremely difficult. You'll want to go with the LCD/Digitizer assembly combo. Hope this helps and happy repairs to you :D
P.S. In case you need help, a tutorial for this repair can be found here
