Title: You Won't Believe How I Lost Both My Bluetooth and Wifi on My Samsung Galaxy A50 - Shocking Tech Mishap!

Hugo writing format:

Introduction:
It was a regular day until I faced a shocking tech mishap. I lost both my Bluetooth and wifi on my Samsung Galaxy A50, and it left me baffled. When I tried to troubleshoot, I discovered the root cause that I'm all set to share with you.

Body:
It all started when I was browsing the internet using my Galaxy A50, and suddenly the wifi icon disappeared from the notification panel. Then, I checked the settings and found that the wifi was turned off, despite me not doing so. I tried turning it on, but it did not connect to any network. After several attempts, I was still unable to connect to any wifi network.

Next up was Bluetooth. After the wifi fiasco, I tried to connect my earphones via Bluetooth. However, I couldn't detect any available devices. Once again, I checked the settings and saw that the Bluetooth was off. Even when I turned it on, none of the devices were visible.

I was perplexed and tried to find a solution to this problem. I searched online, visited forums, and even visited the Samsung service center but didn't get any help. After some more internet surfing, I found out that there's an option in the settings called Safe Mode. The Safe Mode runs the phone only with the pre-installed apps and disables any third-party apps. I booted the phone in Safe Mode and voila! Both the wifi and Bluetooth were working perfectly.

It dawned on me that the issue was with an app that I installed recently, which was causing conflicts with the phone's Bluetooth and wifi settings. I uninstalled the app, and that's all it took to fix the issue.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, losing both the Bluetooth and wifi on my Samsung Galaxy A50 was a shocking and confusing tech mishap. However, all it took was some troubleshooting, research, and testing to find out what was causing the problem. Finally, booting the phone in Safe Mode and uninstalling the problematic app solved the issue. It was a valuable lesson for me to be wary of apps that could potentially wreak havoc on my phone's settings. So, always be cautious of the apps that you install, and take necessary precautions when faced with tech issues.

## Chosen Solution
 I lost bluetooth and wifi connections.   Samsung support reset.  Then backed up on the cloud and did a factory reset.  Did not work.

 Hi @jojoandme ,
Do the WiFi and BT turn on OK?
If so try placing the phone as close as possible to either a  WiFi router or a BT device and check if there is an entry in the list of available connections dependent on the signal type being checked.
If there is then it may be that there is an antenna problem in the phone. WiFi and BT use the same frequency (2.4GHz) so they share the same antennas.
Here’s the ifixit Samsung Galaxy A50 Screen Replacement guide. I realize that the screen is not the problem but the guide is useful as it shows how to open the phone and access the antennas to see if they’re both connected OK.
Here’s an image taken from Step.14 of the guide that shows just one end of the antennas and where they are connected. Unfortunately there are no images showing the other end of the antennas but you should be able to see them and check once the phone is open.
