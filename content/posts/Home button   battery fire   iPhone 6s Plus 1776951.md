Title: WARNING: Is Your iPhone 6S Plus Home Button Putting You in Danger?! Find Out Now!

Introduction:

Have you ever thought that your beloved iPhone 6S Plus home button would put you in danger? If you haven't, this is the right time to think about it. The iPhone 6S Plus home button is not just another feature, but it has a lot of functionalities that most users may not know about. Unfortunately, some hidden features of this button may put your safety and security at risk. Therefore, it is essential to find out if your iPhone 6S Plus home button is putting you in danger.

Body:

The iPhone 6S Plus home button's functionalities are not limited to unlocking your phone or returning to the home screen. Apple designed this button to work as a fingerprint scanner, triggering Siri, and activating the emergency SOS features. While most of these features are useful and convenient, some could have a negative impact.

For instance, the emergency SOS feature can be activated by pressing the home button five times. This feature is designed to help you dial emergency services when you are in a dangerous situation. However, pressing the home button five times accidentally when you have set it up could trigger a false emergency call. This is not only embarrassing but could also land you in trouble with the authorities.

Another hidden functionality of the iPhone 6S Plus home button is its ability to trigger Siri. While Siri is useful in helping you complete some tasks hands-free, it could put your safety at risk in some situations. If your phone is in your pocket or bag, and you accidentally trigger Siri, it could activate voice-assistant, giving away your phone's location in case an undesirable person tries to steal your phone.

Apart from that, the home button's fingerprint scanner could also put your safety and security at risk. While this feature is designed to provide an extra layer of security, it could also be compromised easily. Hackers can replicate fingerprints to gain unauthorized access to your phone, which could expose sensitive information or data.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, it is crucial to find out if your iPhone 6S Plus home button is putting you in danger. While some functionalities of this button are useful and convenient, others could put your safety and security at risk. Therefore, it is advisable to take appropriate measures to avoid any undesirable situations. You can disable some of the features, such as the emergency SOS feature or Siri, to avoid accidentally triggering them. Additionally, you can also enhance the phone's security by adding an extra layer of authentication or using a password rather than fingerprints.

## Chosen Solution
 Changed battery on my cousin’s 6s plus ….. it was damaged and actually caught on fire when removing it. I quickly got it out of phone , it appeared not to do too much damage. Some scorching in the left corner around and on headphone jack . I cleaned it up put new battery in , put it back together powered up everything worked EXECPT home button ….. top screen / home button was not on/near battery when it caught on fire … do I need to change charging port / headphone jack assembly….. or something else like change the entire back assembly of the phone . Need some ideas or help on what direction to go

 If you didn’t remove the actual home button I would make sure the connector is seated properly. If it is than you have most likely damaged the flex cable or nudged a tiny component around the connector. If it is a damaged flex you will need to replace the screen.
The charge dock has nothing to do with the home button.

 Thanks, Chris …..The reason I asked about the port and the surrounding area is , because in reading one of the other posts , talking about the home button , someone mentioned a broken or bad ( in my case melted ) connection causing a continuity problem that affected the home button. …. I’ve removed and reconnected everything multiple times. And when the fire took place the screen and button where 4 feet away, so the fire couldn’t have damaged the cables or connectors. Not to say I might have when I removed them with spudger . Is there anything under the headphone jack orTaptic Engine that could cause this issue? Like a ground wire or a ribbon cable …..any or next idea please
