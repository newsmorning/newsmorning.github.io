# You Won't Believe How Many Colossal Axes Are Hiding in Elden Ring - Our Epic List Revealed!

Elden Ring, the upcoming action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and co-created by Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin, has been on the hype radar ever since its announcement at E3 2019. The game promises to offer a grand adventure in a world of mythology and dark fantasy, filled with iconic bosses, intricate lore, and  thrilling combat. And one of the most exciting aspects of the game is the massive variety of weapons and equipment you can use to slay orcs, demons, dragons, and other formidable foes.

Among the weapons, axes hold a special place, as they are often associated with brute strength, heavy damage, and satisfying swings. In Elden Ring, axes come in all shapes and sizes, from small hatchets to giant two-handed monsters that can cleave through stone and steel. And in this article, we'll showcase some of the most impressive and awe-inspiring axes we've seen so far in Elden Ring. Get ready to be amazed!

## 1. The Stone-Crushing Axe of Hraesvelgr

Hraesvelgr is one of the hardest bosses in Elden Ring, a monstrous bird of prey that can summon storm clouds and hurl lightning bolts. To defeat him, you'll need a weapon that can crush his thick feathers and pierce his armored scales. And that's where the Stone-Crushing Axe of Hraesvelgr comes in. This axe is not only gigantic and heavy, but also has a chain attached to its head, allowing you to swing it like a flail and smash your enemies into submission.

## 2. The Ice-Forged Axe of Ymir

Ymir is a legendary giant of Norse mythology, known for his immense strength and magical powers. In Elden Ring, you'll encounter Ymir as a boss, and you'll need to overcome his icy attacks and formidable stamina. To do so, you may want to wield the Ice-Forged Axe of Ymir, a massive weapon made of pure ice and imbued with frost powers. Not only does this axe deal massive damage to enemies weak to ice, but it also slows down their movements and lowers their defense, making them easy targets for follow-up attacks.

## 3. The Winged Axe of Harpyia

Harpyia is a winged demon that preys on humans and delights in their screams. She can fly high above and swoop down to attack you with her razor-sharp talons and piercing screeches. To counter her aerial threats, you'll need a weapon that can reach her height and strike her from afar. The Winged Axe of Harpyia is just the tool for the job. This axe has a pair of wings attached to its back, allowing you to throw it like a boomerang and hit enemies in mid-air. The axe also deals bonus damage to flying enemies and can knock them down to the ground, leaving them vulnerable to combo attacks.

## 4. The Fire-Brandished Axe of Salamandra

Salamandra is a dragon that dwells in the deepest cave of Elden Ring, guarding a treasure hoard that would make even Smaug envious. To face her flames and cut through her scales, you'll need a weapon that can withstand heat and deliver explosive force. The Fire-Brandished Axe of Salamandra is the tool of choice for this task. This axe is made of volcanic rock and enchanted with fire, making it resistant to fire damage and able to deal fire damage to enemies. The axe also has a special ability that allows you to charge it up and release a fiery blast that can stun enemies and set them on fire.

## 5. The Sun-Crowned Axe of Apollo

Apollo is a god of light and music, known for his radiance and eloquence. In Elden Ring, you'll encounter him as a patron of a hidden shrine, where he tests your faith and rewards your courage. To prove your worthiness and win his favor, you'll need a weapon that can reflect his brilliance and power. The Sun-Crowned Axe of Apollo is the ultimate weapon for this purpose. This axe has a golden blade and a gem-encrusted hilt, shining like the sun itself. The axe also has a special ability that allows you to absorb sunlight and convert it into raw power, increasing your damage and speed for a short time.

These are just five examples of the many awe-inspiring axes you can find in Elden Ring. From flaming hammers to thundering mauls, from poisonous sickles to enchanted halberds, the game has a vast array of weapons to suit any playstyle and taste. Whether you want to hack and slash your way through hordes of enemies or deal devastating blows to bosses, Elden Ring has something for you. So, get ready to venture into a world of wonder and danger, armed with your trusty axe, and join the epic quest for the Elden Ring!
