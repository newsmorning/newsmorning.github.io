# Is your Windows 11 crashing? Here are 5 life-saving solutions to fix "Kernel Security Check Failure" in minutes!

Kernel Security Check Failure is an issue that Microsoft Windows users often encounter. It is usually caused by outdated or faulty drivers, corrupt system files, and malware infection. It can be frustrating to deal with this issue, as it can lead to crashes, slow performance, and other problems. Fortunately, there are several solutions that you can try to fix Kernel Security Check Failure. 

In this article, we will discuss five life-saving solutions that can help you fix Kernel Security Check Failure in minutes.

## Solution 1: Update Your Drivers

The first solution you should try is to update all the drivers on your PC. Outdated drivers can cause Kernel Security Check Failure, so it's essential to ensure that all your drivers are up to date. You can check your Windows Device Manager to see which drivers need updating.

To update your drivers, you can visit the manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers. Alternatively, you can use a driver updater tool that will automatically find and install the latest drivers for you.

## Solution 2: Run System File Checker

System File Checker is a built-in Windows tool that scans your system for corrupt system files and replaces them with new ones. If you're experiencing Kernel Security Check Failure, running System File Checker can help fix the issue.

To run System File Checker, follow these steps:

1. Click on Start and type "cmd" in the search bar
2. Right-click on Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator"
3. Type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter
4. Wait for the system scan to complete

If System File Checker finds any corrupt system files, it will replace them with new ones. Once the scan is complete, restart your PC and check if the issue is resolved.

## Solution 3: Disable Overclocking

Overclocking is the process of forcing your PC's components to run faster than their factory settings. While overclocking can improve performance, it can also cause Kernel Security Check Failure.

If you're experiencing this issue and have overclocked your PC, you should disable it to see if it fixes the problem. To disable overclocking, you can access your PC's BIOS settings and reset them to the default settings.

## Solution 4: Perform a Malware Scan

Malware infection can also cause Kernel Security Check Failure. To ensure that your PC is not infected with malware, you should perform a malware scan using a reliable antivirus software.

There are several antivirus software options available, including free and paid versions. You can choose the one that suits your needs and perform a full system scan to detect and remove any malware.

## Solution 5: Reset Your PC

If none of the above solutions work, you can try resetting your PC to its factory settings. This will remove all your files and software and restore your PC to its original state.

To reset your PC, follow these steps:

1. Click on Start and select "Settings"
2. Click on "Update & Security" and select "Recovery"
3. Click on "Reset this PC" and select "Get started"
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the reset process

Resetting your PC should fix Kernel Security Check Failure. However, make sure to backup all your important files before resetting your PC.

## Conclusion

Kernel Security Check Failure is a common issue that can cause crashes and slow performance on your PC. By following the solutions mentioned above, you can fix this issue in minutes. Updating your drivers, running System File Checker, disabling overclocking, performing a malware scan, and resetting your PC are all effective solutions that can help you get rid of Kernel Security Check Failure.
