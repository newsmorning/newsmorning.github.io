Say Goodbye to Doom Eternal FPS Drops with These 5 Game-Changing Fixes!

As one of the most popular and intense first-person shooter games on the market, Doom Eternal demands a lot from your computer hardware. Gamers need to make sure their CPU, GPU, and RAM are all up to par and running at optimal levels to ensure a smooth and immersive gameplay experience. Unfortunately, even the most powerful machines may struggle with FPS (frames per second) drops, which can significantly diminish a players’ enjoyment of the game. However, there are solutions available that can help fix these drops and keep you playing without interruption. Here are 5 game-changing fixes to say goodbye to Doom Eternal FPS drops:

1. Turn on V-sync

V-Sync is a graphics technology that will match your monitor's refresh rate with your game's frame rate. This will prevent the stuttering or tearing of the screen, allowing for smoother gameplay. 

2. Lower your video settings

It's essential to remember that the more detail your graphics settings have, the more demanding your game will be on your computer. By adjusting the video settings, you can reduce the load on your hardware and ensure that your game runs smoothly.

3. Update your GPU drivers

Keeping your graphics card drivers updated is crucial for performance. New versions often introduce optimizations and improvements that can help you achieve better FPS and prevent drops. Make sure to check your GPU drivers and update regularly.

4. Use a game boosting app

Game booster applications are tools designed to help improve gameplay performance while running in the background. They are easy to use, allow you to customize your system for optimal performance and run certain applications at higher priority. This method can significantly improve FPS in Doom Eternal.

5. Invest in new hardware

Last but not least, upgrading your hardware may be the most effective solution if you're experiencing continual FPS drops. A powerful graphics card, faster RAM or a better CPU can make all the difference in how well your game runs. 

In conclusion, Doom Eternal is a stunning game that can push your computer hardware to the limit. However, with these 5 game-changing fixes, you can quickly overcome the FPS drops and enjoy an uninterrupted gaming experience. Remember to check your settings, drivers and invest in new hardware which will provide you with the perfect combination for optimal Doom Eternal FPS. Good luck in the game!

Doom Eternal is an incredible-looking first-person-shooter game, but it’s far from a perfect experience. It suffers from inconsistent frame rate problems during intense encounters, which can be a real bummer when you’re in the thick of battle.
 
## Forego some high-efficiency settings for a boost in FPS
 
- Every gamer has experienced it at some point: the sudden, dramatic plunge of frames per second (FPS) that causes your screen to stutter and lag.If you don’t have a powerful processor, this should not come as a surprise given how resource-intensive Doom Eternal is.Usually, closing unnecessary programs could improve the FPS drop but if not, we have more tricks up our sleeves.

When it comes to any game that requires you to be able to aim precisely, dropped frames will have an impact. These games are more likely than others to have lower FPS because they require more processing power and perhaps more graphics memory than others.
 
Almost every action-oriented video game drops frames. It’s not just a Doom Eternal thing; it cuts across the board. However, with a few tweaks here and there, you can easily achieve decent framerates that won’t frustrate your gameplay.
 
## Why does Doom Eternal keep dropping frames?
 
For a game called Doom Eternal, it sure seems to be dropping the ball a lot. The framerate tends to fall below smooth levels. But the bigger question here is why? Here are some possible causes:
 
- System requirements – Doom Eternal is a fast-paced, intense game that requires your computer to run at a high frame rate so that you can enjoy playing the game and experience everything it has to offer. To make sure you’re able to run Doom Eternal at the best frame rates possible, we recommend your computer meet or exceed the minimum system requirements.
 - Poor graphics card – If you don’t have a good enough graphics card to support the resource-intensive modern games you may experience random FPS drops in Doom Eternal. Even with sufficient RAM or processing power by itself, a video card that just can’t keep up with your games can cause them to run slow and crash frequently.
 - Outdated OS – If you are playing the game on a PC, make sure that you are up-to-date with the latest updates. Most games are optimized to work with the latest versions so if the game detects an old OS, it may struggle to balance the available resources for maximum efficiency.

 
## How can I fix FPS drops, lag, and stuttering in Doom Eternal?
 
### 1. Check hardware specs
 
Always ensure that when you are downloading and playing a game on your device, it meets the minimum system requirements. Some games are stringent on the specs such that the game won’t even launch on your device.
 
Others on the other hand may allow you to download and even play but it will be far from enjoyable as you will keep getting interrupted with the frequent stuttering or low FPS during startup.
 
### 2. Update your graphics card
 
- Press the Windows key, type Device Manager in the search box, and click Open.
 - Navigate to Display adapters, right-click on your graphics card and select Update driver.
 - Select Search automatically for drivers.

 
Since this solution might not work every single time, we recommend using a specialized tool that will scan your PC and update all outdated drivers automatically. 
 
### 3. Close unnecessary background processes
 
If you have a bunch of programs running in the background or heavy downloads in queue while you are playing, you may experience a drop in FPS on Doom Eternal.
 
Big-time gaming can be done without crashes, lags or freezes by keeping all drivers up to date and error-free. Manual checks are hard to perform, that’s why we recommend using an automate assistant that will scan for fresh driver versions daily. Here is how to use it:
 
- Download and install DriverFix.
 - Launch the software.
 - Wait for the newly installed app to detect all your PC’s faulty drivers.
 - You will be presented with a list of all the drivers that have issues, and you can choose the ones that you want to fix.
 - Wait for the driver download and fixing process to complete.
 - Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

 
Disclaimer: this program needs to be upgraded from the free version in order to perform some specific actions.
 
### DriverFix
 
 Do not let a bad driver interfere with your games and installed software. Use DriverFix today and run them without a single issue.

 
This is because too many programs are competing for the available resources. The situation could cause your game to even crash in some instances especially if you are operating an older processor.
 
### 4. Adjust game settings
 
Some extra features can also affect performance and cause FPS drops in Doom Eternal, like shadows and ray tracing. If you’re experiencing lag or stuttering while playing Doom Eternal, try disabling these extras to see if it helps improve your frame rate.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

### Does Doom Eternal run at 120 FPS?
 
Doom Eternal runs at 60 frames per second on consoles but can be unlocked to run at 120 FPS on PC if you’ve got the hardware for it. Why does this matter? Well, a high framerate is crucial for an enjoyable experience with Doom Eternal. 
 
If your game can’t keep up with the action, it’ll feel sluggish and frustrating. You’ll be able to appreciate the level of detail in Doom Eternal’s world and combat when it’s running at 120 FPS.

If you don’t have the hardware for higher FPS, you can instead install FPS booster software for an elevated experience.
 
Alternatively, you can also tweak your computer with the best FPS settings to further enhance your gameplay.
