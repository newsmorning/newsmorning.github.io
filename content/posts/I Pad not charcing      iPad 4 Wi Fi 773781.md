Intro: Apple has been one of the leading brands in the tech industry, providing its users with premium features and performance. However, recent reports have surfaced about the iPad 4 Wi-Fi not charging. Is this the end of the road for your device? Let's explore the issue and look for solutions.

Body:

Firstly, let's understand the problem at hand. Users have reported that their iPad 4 Wi-Fi is not charging, even when connected to a power source. This issue can stem from a variety of reasons including a faulty charging port, damaged connector cables, or even a software glitch.

Apple has acknowledged the issue and has offered some solutions to the problem. One of the first things to try is to force restart your device by pressing and holding the power and home buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. You can also try cleaning the charging port and replacing the charging cable to see if that solves the issue.

If none of the above solutions work, it may be time to take your device to an authorized Apple store for further inspection. Don't try to fix the issue yourself as this may void the warranty on your device.

It's important to note that this issue is not limited to the iPad 4 Wi-Fi alone. Other devices from Apple and other tech brands have reported similar issues with their charging ports. The bottom line is that proper care and maintenance of your device is crucial to ensure that it functions optimally.

## Chosen Solution
 My i Pad 4 its not charging. All the time standing on 1%. I change docking connector, and still its the same problem. Also hard reset iPad a couple times, check charger and cord and everything its ok. Maybe battery its dead????

 It could be the battery, but could also be a damaged charging IC on the logic board.
