Shocking Discovery: Changing Battery on Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB Won't Fix Charging Issue - Find out Why!

If you own an Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB, then you must be familiar with its charging issue. In fact, many users have reported that their laptops won't charge or power on, despite trying all the conventional troubleshooting methods.

As a solution, some users have attempted to replace the laptop battery, thinking that a faulty battery is the cause of the problem. However, they were surprised to find out that changing the battery did not fix the charging issue. So, why is that the case?

First of all, it's important to understand that the Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB uses an embedded battery. An embedded battery is a battery that is permanently installed in a device and cannot be removed.

This means that you cannot simply remove the battery and replace it with a new one. In fact, attempting to do so can cause more harm than good, as it may damage the laptop's internal components.

So, if changing the battery won't fix the charging issue, what is the solution? The answer lies in the laptop's power adapter.

The Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB comes with a small, compact power adapter that can easily get damaged. In fact, many users have reported that the power adapter stopped working altogether, causing the laptop to stop charging.

To solve this issue, you need to replace the power adapter. Thankfully, Acer provides a replacement adapter that you can buy from their website or authorized dealers.

Once you have replaced the power adapter, you should be able to charge your Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB without any issues. If the laptop still won't charge, then you may need to contact Acer's customer support for further assistance.

In conclusion, replacing the battery on the Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB won't fix the charging issue. Instead, you need to replace the power adapter. Keep this in mind, and you'll be able to easily resolve any charging issues with your laptop.


## Chosen Solution
 I changed the battery successful from one that was not functioning to one that is really great and performs well. However, the battery is not charging at all.
The Chromebook will retain the 60% of power that came with the new battery; it will use the power adapter as a source when the latter is plugged in.. But the battery itself won’t increase from 60%. It will just drain when not plugged in, but not charge.
The power jack was acting a little weird before any of this (had to be at a perfect angle to charge). I bought a new ac adapter. It has the exact same problem. If it’s not at the perfect angle, it won’t charge my computer.
I’m wondering if the battery issue is not connected to the power jack issue. I have a feeling they are, but I have no idea how to even begin to diagnose the problem or to fix it.
Any good questions or answers are very welcome! :)

 A good way to check the health of your Chromebook battery is to use the Crosh utility. To open up Crosh, press ctrl + alt + t on your keyboard.
When Crosh opens, type battery_test at the crosh> prompt. This will start the battery health test. Since your battery is new, the health grade should be almost perfect. If it isn’t, then the battery will need to be replaced soon, if not refunded (if it is in fact refundable).
The power jack of the Acer Chromebook CB3-111-C8UB is soldered onto the motherboard, and is therefore difficult to replace. You could buy a whole new motherboard, but the whole process (motherboard, tools, shipping costs) may end up costing more than the laptop itself.

 Buy a new part were the adapter goes into it is probable broken.
