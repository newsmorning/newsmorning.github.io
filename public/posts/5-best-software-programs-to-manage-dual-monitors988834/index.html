While using dual monitor setup could help boost productivity, managing both screens can become a challenging task.\nLuckily, several dual monitor management tools are available that can help you streamline your workflow, save time, and optimize your productivity. In this article, we will explore the top five dual monitor management tools you should consider.\nDisplayFusion DisplayFusion is an essential tool for managing dual monitors. It comes with numerous features that make it more than just a traditional dual monitor application. With DisplayFusion, you can organize and manage your desktop in many ways. It allows you to customize your screensavers, create taskbars, and save your window position and size for future use.\nUltramon Ultramon is another powerful dual monitor management tool that enables you to customize the settings for each screen. This tool comes with a smart taskbar, which displays the programs running on the primary and secondary screen. Moreover, Ultramon has advanced features, such as mirroring the primary screen to the secondary screen, and managing multiple monitors in a workgroup.\nMultiMonitorTool MultiMonitorTool is a free dual monitor management tool that allows you to manage multiple monitors with ease. With this tool, you can customize the position and size of the windows, save the display settings, and change the orientation of the screen. Additionally, MultiMonitorTool allows you to create profiles, which you can load whenever you connect your dual monitors.\nDual Monitor Tools Dual Monitor Tools is a collection of apps specifically designed for dual monitor setups. This toolset contains many utilities, including dual wallpaper, dual snap, dual web, and dual launcher, among others. These utilities allow you to personalize and manage your dual monitors with ease. With Dual Monitor Tools, you can easily manage your windows’ position and size, view different wallpapers on each screen, and launch apps on either screen.\nActual Multiple Monitors Actual Multiple Monitors is a feature-rich tool that helps you maximize your dual monitor setup. It comes with several features that allow you to customize your desktop, add new taskbars, and change the wallpaper. Moreover, Actual Multiple Monitors provides a comprehensive window management solution, allowing you to control your windows on both monitors.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, using dual monitors can significantly boost your productivity, but the key to managing them is using the right tools. The five dual monitor management tools discussed above can help you increase your efficiency, streamline your workflow, and save time. Choose the one that works best for you, and enjoy the productivity benefits of a well-managed dual monitor setup.\nHaving a dual-monitor setup has been the secret weapon of desktop productivity for years. Of course, these days a much more elegant solution is to buy a large ultrawide screen. However, simply hooking up a second monitor is fast and affordable way to add more workspace. Not to mention that any laptop users with external screens have a dual-monitor setup by default!\nThese free dual monitor programs make it easy to configure and control your multi-monitor setup in Windows. So you spend less time fiddling with monitor settings and more time actually doing productive work.\nDual Monitor Tools Not only is Dual Monitor Tools free, this is also an open source dual monitor program. Actually, we should say “packages” since it’s actually a collection of modules that you can mix and match. For example, Dual Wallpaper is a standalone tool that lets you have different wallpapers on each screen. So if that’s all you want, that’s all you need to download.\nDMT allows or some pretty interesting tricks. For example, DMT cursor lets you customize mouse cursor behavior. You can lock the cursor to one monitor, make it harder to move between monitors or allow free movement. This is pretty handy if you have a use case where the cursor accidentally ends up where it shouldn’t this could be a lifesaver.\nDMT resides in the notification area and you can quickly access all the modules from there. It’s not fancy (or pretty), but these tools are incredibly useful!\nDisplayFusion (Free Version) DisplayFusion is probably the best-known multi-monitor program around. With good reason! This is the application that brings it all together: Multi-monitor taskbars, variable wallpapers, keyboard shortcuts and more. The paid “Pro” version comes with much more on top of this, but for the vast majority of people DisplayFusion Free will be more than they need to get the most out of their dual-monitor setup.\nWindows 8 users in particular will like the smattering of specialized tweaks included with the free version. You can hide the lock screen, disable the Windows 8 “hot” corners and change the border size of app windows. All points of irritation for many users of that operating system. DisplayFusion also offers wonderful advanced window-snapping functions that make window management across multiple monitors that much easier. Which includes the ability to snap windows to monitor edges. An infuriating oversight in Windows itself.\nAnyone running Windows with more than one monitor should at least give DisplayFusion a try. It really is a transformative tool. You’ll get a Pro version trial at the outset, so you’ll get to try the Pro features to see if any are worth the asking price.\nMultiMonitorTool Not every dual monitor program has to be elaborate or over-engineered to be useful. MultiMonitorTool is the perfect example of this. It’s a basic, lightweight utility that puts a lot of power right under your fingertips. For one thing, it will accept command-line instructions and you can see a live preview of the multi-monitor setup you are currently using. That makes it perfect for computers that are running multiple monitors in a public space. Apart from the command-line interface, you can do common tasks such as moving windows between monitors with keyboard shortcuts.\nThis tool will work with versions of Windows as far back as XP all the way to current versions of Windows 10. So if you have to use a public computer, such as in a lecture hall, or are otherwise running older hardware on multi-monitor setups, MultiMonitorTool is a real lifesaver.\nMultiMon Taskbar 2.1 (Free) There is a newer version of MultiMon Taskbar available, sporting the version number “3.5”. However this is the “Pro” version which comes with a price tag. Users who want a free tool therefore have to opt for version 2.1, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. There are simply feature differences here.\nThe free version of the dual monitor software adds taskbars to extended monitors in Windows. It can do this for up to three monitor setups. Each monitor’s taskbar only shows the apps on that monitor. That includes not showing apps on the primary monitor taskbar that aren’t that monitor. This free tool is only designed to work up to Windows 7, but there are still plenty of computers out there running this older operating system. MultiMon is quite a stable piece of software as well, so if you have a multi-monitor system of the right vintage, it’s worth checking out.\nWindows 10 (You Didn’t See This Coming!) Microsoft has been paying attention to the world of third-party multi-monitor utilities. Which means that, if you are already running Windows 10, there are a bunch of features baked into the system that you’d have needed a third-party solution for in the past.\nThere are now a wealth of multi-monitor customization options built into windows, with support for just about any arrangement and mix or resolutions and orientations. Windows 10 natively supports having different wallpapers on each screen. Multi-monitor taskbars? Already done!\nWindows 10 also has a snazzy virtual desktop feature, shortcut keys to quickly switch multi-monitor modes and easy shortcuts to snap or maximize windows.\nThe truth is that, for most users, the best dual-monitor management features are already built into Windows 10. Third-party developers did a lot of free research and development work for Microsoft, who simply had to copy the features that worked for their own operating system.\nIs More Better? We still recommend getting an ultrawide screen for the productivity gains and lack of mid-screen bezel, if you’re starting from a blank slate. But if you find the dual-monitor life is the one for you, then these dual monitor programs are essential to keep all that real-estate under control. Don’t forget that you can also easily add an extra screen via USB. Either by using a dedicated USB display or using a tablet like the Apple iPad and an app like DuetDisplay. It’s a great trick if you don’t permanently need dual monitors, or want to benefit from that setup on the road.\nThere are even clip-on USB monitors for laptops that make dual- and triple- monitor setups possible in mobile setups. The dual monitor apps above could certainly come in handy with these solutions!\n","wordCount":"1484","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lakisha Puskar"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/5-best-software-programs-to-manage-dual-monitors988834/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Boost Your Productivity with These 5 Amazing Dual Monitor Management Tools!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 20, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1484 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lakisha Puskar</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#dual-monitor-tools>Dual Monitor Tools</a></li><li><a href=#displayfusion-free-version>DisplayFusion (Free Version)</a></li><li><a href=#multimonitortool>MultiMonitorTool</a></li><li><a href=#multimon-taskbar-21-free>MultiMon Taskbar 2.1 (Free)</a></li><li><a href=#windows-10-you-didnt-see-this-coming>Windows 10 (You Didn’t See This Coming!)</a></li><li><a href=#is-more-better>Is More Better?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Boost Your Productivity with These 5 Amazing Dual Monitor Management Tools!</p><p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced and competitive world, productivity can make a significant difference in achieving your goals.
