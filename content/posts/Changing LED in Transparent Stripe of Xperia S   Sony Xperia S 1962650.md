# You Won't Believe the Stunning Transformation of Your Sony Xperia S When You Change the LED in Its Transparent Stripe!



If you own a Sony Xperia S, you might be in for a pleasant surprise. Have you ever looked at the transparent stripe on the back of your phone and wondered what it's for? You might be surprised to know that it's actually an LED light that can change colors based on different notifications!

Now, you may be thinking, "Why should I bother changing the LED in my phone? What difference could it possibly make?" The answer is: it can make a huge difference!

Firstly, changing the LED color can help you customize your phone and make it truly yours. You can select different colors for different types of notifications, making it easy to know what's going on without even looking at your screen. For example, you can set a red LED for missed calls, blue for text messages, green for emails, and so on.

But that's not all - changing the LED color can also add a touch of elegance and style to your phone. Imagine walking into a dark room, and your phone's LED lights up with a beautiful, vibrant color. It can make your phone stand out from the rest, and give it a unique character that's all your own.

Luckily, changing the LED color on your Xperia S is easy. All you have to do is download an app like Light Flow or LED Blinker, which allow you to customize your LED color and settings. Once you've installed the app, you can select the LED color and type of notification you want it to display.

And if you're not the DIY type, you can always purchase LED strips or covers that come pre-programmed with various LED colors and settings.

In conclusion, changing the LED in your Xperia S can truly transform your phone. It can add a new level of functionality, style, and customization, making your phone truly your own. So go ahead, play around with different LED colors and settings, and see for yourself just how stunning your Xperia S can truly be!
