Title: "The Shocking Truth: My Experience with Inverting Charger Polarity on My Samsung NP530U4BL Laptop"

It was a typical evening, and I was working on my laptop when a sudden power outage occurred. I had been using my Samsung NP530U4BL for a few years and had never faced any significant issues with it. Hence, I assumed that the battery had died and plugged it in for charging.

However, as soon as I plugged the charger in, I realized that I had made a terrible mistake - I had inadvertently switched the polarity of the charging cable. I panicked as I knew this could cause some serious damage to my laptop. 

Before I could unplug it, a curious thing happened. My laptop switched on and started charging. Surprised and confused, I observed it closely. The charger was inverted, yet my system was working fine. It was almost as if nothing had happened, and my system was unfazed by the mistake I had made.

I wondered how my system was still working, and after some research, I found that the Samsung NP530U4BL is equipped with polarity protection that enables it to detect when its charger is inverted. This feature is not common in all laptops and devices, and it can save your system from damage caused by incorrect polarity.

Even though my laptop had not suffered any harm, I realized that I had narrowly avoided disaster. I learned a valuable lesson: always double-check the polarity when plugging in anything to an electronic device. 

In conclusion, my experience with inverting my charger polarity was shocking, but it made me understand how important it is to pay attention to the details. The polarity protection feature in the Samsung NP530U4BL laptop saved me from significant harm, and I am grateful for it. Electronic devices are an important aspect of our lives, and it is crucial to use them with care and caution to keep them working efficiently for a long time.


## Chosen Solution
 By mistake tha cable charger polarity was inverted and the notebook is no more charging.

 Not sure if your charger is the type that shuts itself off, when something is wrong.
Does the charger have a status light ?  Does it come on when you plug it into the wall ?
If not, the charger may be dead.
In any case, remove the laptop battery.   Do not leave it in the machine.
If its over 2  years old, I recommend a replacement.
Try- With the battery out, plug in your charger.  Will the laptop power-up ? Are any lights ON ?
The charger (assuming it still works) will power the laptop without the battery.   Usually, the battery light will show red/yellow/green.     PowerOn/Charging/BatteryGood/Bad
If it works, you're happy, all you need is a new battery.
If it does not work, take laptop, dead battery, and charger to the serviceman.  There are several tests that can be done without dis-assembly.   Before you D.I.Y.   (  Do It Yourself ),  search the web for "samsung laptop how to".  You will find several YouTube movies.
