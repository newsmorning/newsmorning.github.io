## Chosen Solution
 I bought a replacement battery but have not yet installed it. Since then my right speaker is failing, with very fuzzy sound. My question is: If I were to replace the speakers as well as the battery, during the same operation, what should the sequence be? Battery, then speakers? Thanks!

 mmmâ€¦
The logic board needs to be removed to replace either! So I would follow this guide: MacBook Pro 15" Retina Display Late 2013 Battery Replacement and then after the battery is removed jump to this guide MacBook Pro 15" Retina Display Late 2013 Speakers Replacement jumping down to Step33 to replace the right speaker. Then I would install the battery and reverse the order putting the parts all back in.
