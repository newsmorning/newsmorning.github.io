Is Your Ge Profile Refrigerator Letting You Down? Discover the Shocking Truth About Why Your Lights Express Chill Is Not Working!

If you own a GE Profile refrigerator, chances are you paid good money for it and expected premium quality. But what happens when your refrigerator begins to let you down? Perhaps the worst scenario is when the lights express chill fails to work, making your fridge inefficient and inconvenient to use. In this article, we’ll explore this problem and offer solutions to help you fix it.

Firstly, let’s look at why light express chill not working is a problem. This feature is designed to help you quickly cool down food and drinks that need immediate refrigeration. It speeds up the cooling process, saving you time and energy in the long run. It works by turning on the fan, compressor, and evaporator fan motor inside the fridge to increase cooling efficiency, but when it stops working, you lose that convenience and efficiency.

There are several reasons why your lights express chill may not work. Some are simple, while others require a professional to fix. Let’s go through some of the common causes of express chill failure.

Temperature Setting: The first and most obvious issue that could cause the light express chill to stop working is the temperature setting. If the temperature is set too high, the fridge will not enter express chill mode. So make sure that the temperature setting is below the recommended range of 34 degrees Fahrenheit.

Damaged Evaporator Fan Motor: The evaporator fan motor is responsible for blowing cold air through the fridge. If this fan motor is damaged or not running properly, the light express chill will not function. You can test this by opening the fridge and listening for the fan. If you can’t hear it, then it may be damaged and need to be replaced.

Faulty Compressor: If your compressor has a fault, it may not be performing optimally, causing your light express chill feature to stop working. You can check if the compressor is faulty by inspecting if it's running with a multimeter.

Faulty Control Board: The control board is responsible for regulating the temperature and functioning of the fridge. If it has a problem, then the entire refrigerator could fail. You can check if the control board is working by inspecting it for signs of wear and tear or monitoring its performance with a multimeter.

In conclusion, if your GE Profile refrigerator is letting you down with its light express chill feature, there are several reasons why it may not be working. We recommend that you check the temperature setting, inspect the evaporator fan motor, check the compressor and examine the control board to solve this issue. If the problem continues, don't hesitate to call a professional for help. With these tips, you can restore the convenience and efficiency of your GE Profile refrigerator.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a GE PSS26SGRD that’s about 15 years old. The other day when I opened the fresh food side, the lights were not illuminated.  Tested bulbs, bulbs are fine. The Express Chill feature no longer works either. The refrigerator is keeping temperature no problem, and the lights on the freezer side work.

 Hi,
Disconnect the power to the fridge and use an Ohmmeter to test that the door switch, part #609 - fresh food section is electrically operating OK i.e. has continuity when the switch is released. It signals the control board to turn the light on and off.
If the switch tests OK you may have to check if there is power at the socket when there should be.
Is it only the Express Chill feature that doesn’t work or also the Express Thaw?
If only the chill it may be the damper that connects to the pan or perhaps the thermistor that controls the temp there. Looking at the parts diagrams - fresh food section, not sure which thermistor it actually is though (see parts #234, 235, 236 & 237) Given the location of the express chill pan it may be #236.
