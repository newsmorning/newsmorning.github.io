## Chosen Solution
 I'm looking to mod my iPod classic.  I wanted to know if it'd be possible to change out the 30 pin connector for lightning and have a wireless charging coil put inside just changing the back cover to plastic/glass to have it charge?

 Sorry not really possible.
Altering the connector from the 30 pin to a Lightning connectors wouldn’t really change anything. If anything you make your iPod less reliable. The physical size of the Lightning is so much smaller you would need to design a new case even then the charging or data rate wouldn’t change.
As for wireless charging I see no way to do that as you would need a completly new charging logic. Besides the work to design a workable case as it would need to be plastic or glass.

 I'm currently working on a wireless charging setup on both a iPod Classic 5th and 7th Gen. I learned early on that soldering the positive and negative connections from my wireless receiver coil to the battery neg/pos terminals on the iPod mainboard immediately drained any battery I had in the iPod. It would, however, charge the battery if it were on a charging station. The only solution is to pull the mainboard of the iPod out and find the pos/neg terminals that the sync port uses via USB and make the coil solders there, where it's meant to receive power. Those terminals are so tiny, though, I'm already dreading it as I'm no soldering expert. This should work, though. You can also purchase charging base stations with a receiver coil kits for about $10 on eBay. I've found even the cheapos to be reliable.

 My best idea? Emulate the Qi chargers for android
Figure out how to connect to 30 pin connector to charge idevices (which connection)get Cheapo qi receiver and remove USB / Lightning connectionConnect wires to old 30 pin connector to correct QI receiver wires to charge.Plug in and make sure it works.get soft plastic case for Ideviceplug 30 pin in then while holding idevice upside down so the receiver is flat to back, slip cover over receiver.put iphone down on qi charger to testThis has benefit of not damaging inside of idevice.
Hardest part is if the 30 pin doesn’t work correctly. I think you may be able to get an lightning to 30 pin adapter, open it up and using a lightening based qi receiver, wire it directly. The best part of this is it all should work and be testable before you even start the project
I have some old powermat based iphone 4 wireless charger cases that work but, I don’t want powermat and Qi charging stations all over the place. I want qi only because all my android devices use that
