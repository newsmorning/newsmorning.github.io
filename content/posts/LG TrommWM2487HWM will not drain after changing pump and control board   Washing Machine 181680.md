Title: Is Your LG Trommwm2487Hwm Washing Your Money Down The Drain? Discover The Shocking Reason Behind Its Refusal To Drain Even After Replacing The Pump and Control Board!

Introduction

Do you own an LG Trommwm2487Hwm washing machine? If you do, then you may have experienced a problem where it refuses to drain even after replacing the pump and control board. Many LG Trommwm2487Hwm washing machine owners have reported this issue, and it often leads to frustration and disappointment.

In this article, we will discuss the shocking reason behind your LG Trommwm2487Hwm washing machine's refusal to drain and explore how you can solve the problem.

Main Body

The most common cause of a washing machine not draining is a clogged drain hose or pump filter. It's essential to check these parts first before jumping into more complicated and costly repairs. If you've done this and you've replaced the pump and control board, but your LG Trommwm2487Hwm washing machine still won't drain, then there may be another problem.

According to repair experts, the issue could be with the washing machine's pressure switch. The pressure switch is responsible for stopping the washing machine from filling with too much water, and it also controls the water level during a wash cycle.

If the pressure switch malfunctions, it may not signal the washing machine to start draining the water after the wash cycle is complete. This can cause the washing machine to continue to fill with water or refuse to drain, even after replacing the pump and control board.

Fortunately, fixing the pressure switch is relatively easy and doesn't require extensive technical knowledge. You can follow these steps to solve the problem:

Step 1: Turn off the washing machine.

Step 2: Remove the top cover of the washing machine by taking out the screws on the back of the unit.

Step 3: Disconnect the pressure switch's electrical connector with a pair of pliers.

Step 4: Remove the pressure switch by unscrewing it from the washing machine's frame.

Step 5: Clean the pressure switch by blowing compressed air into the ports or soaking it in hot water for a few minutes.

Step 6: Reattach the pressure switch to the washing machine's frame and reconnect the electrical connector.

Step 7: Turn on the washing machine and run a test cycle to see if it now drains correctly.

Conclusion

In conclusion, if you own an LG Trommwm2487Hwm washing machine and it refuses to drain even after replacing the pump and control board, then you may have a problem with the pressure switch. It's essential to check this part before jumping into expensive repairs or calling a technician.

By following the steps outlined in this article, you can solve the problem and save yourself some money. Remember to always turn off the washing machine and unplug it from the power source before attempting any repairs.

If the problem persists, consider contacting a technician for further assistance. Don't let your LG Trommwm2487Hwm washing machine wash your money down the drain.


## Chosen Solution
 I got OE code. I changed the drain assembly (including both drain & circulation pumps). I removed and cleaned the tub to pump and pump to drain hoses, there were no clogs. Still would not drain.  I had pumps checked at local electric motor shop, they are good.
I changed the control board and the machine still will not drain. It passes test 11 & 12 of the QC Test Mode. It seems to fail test 2 & 3 - the machine does tumble. Everything works fine until it is time to drain. What else could it be?

 hi @cs108 ,
Since it fails QC 2 & 3 perhaps the sensor is faulty. (see heating without water section)
I think that this may be the sensor as it says heater, water level, frequency, thermistor, but Iâ€™m not sure.
Looking at the p.15 Program chart, the drain function comes just before the spin and the QC tests that fail are the spin tests.
Just what I would look at.
