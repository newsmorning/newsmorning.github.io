Title: Attention All Music Lovers: Discover The Secret To Repairing Your Volkano Bazooka Charging Port - No More Interruptions in Your Jamming Sessions!

Introduction:

If you are a music lover, you know how important it is to have uninterrupted jamming sessions with your friends, especially when you have a reliable speaker like the Volkano Bazooka. It produces high-quality sound, has a long battery life, and is easy to connect to different devices. However, like many electronic devices, you may occasionally encounter a problem with the charging port. The good news is that the issue is not terminal, and this article will guide you on discovering the secret to repairing your Volkano Bazooka charging port, ensuring that your jamming sessions are uninterrupted.

Step 1: Gather your tools

Before repairing your Volkano Bazooka charging port, you need to have the following tools:

• Screwdriver

• Soldering iron

• Heat shrink tube

• Flux

• USB charging port

Step 2: Disassemble the Volkano Bazooka

To access the charging port, you need to disassemble the speaker by removing the screws at the bottom. Once you have removed the screws, open the speaker, but be careful not to damage the wires or other components.

Step 3: Locate the charging port

The charging port is located on the circuit board, and it is connected to the battery via wires. The charging port is relatively small and rectangular in shape, with four pins sticking out from each side.

Step 4: Remove the old charging port

To remove the old charging port, heat up your soldering iron, and use it to melt the solder on the pins connecting the charging port to the board. Once the solder has melted, use the screwdriver to gently pry the charging port from the board, being careful not to damage the board or the surrounding components.

Step 5: Install the new charging port

Once you have removed the old charging port, it's time to install the new one. The process is simply the reverse of removing the old charging port. Apply a small amount of flux to the four pins of the new charging port, and then place it where the old one was. Heat up your soldering iron again, and use it to solder the pins of the new charging port to connect it to the board.

Step 6: Test the charging port

After you've installed the new charging port, it's time to test it. Switch on the speaker and connect it to a power source using the USB charging cable. If the charging port is working correctly, the speaker should start charging. If it does not, repeat the process, or seek professional help.

Step 7: Reassemble the Volkano Bazooka

After you've tested the charging port, it's time to reassemble the speaker. Make sure that you connect all the wires and components correctly, and then securely place the screws back into the holes at the bottom of the speaker.

Conclusion:

Repairing your Volkano Bazooka charging port does not require a lot of technical knowledge or expertise. With the right tools and the right steps, you can easily fix the problem and avoid interruptions in your jamming sessions. Performing the repairs yourself is not only cost-effective but also gives you a sense of accomplishment. If, however, you are not comfortable performing repairs yourself, seek the services of a professional technician. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can be sure your speaker will be working like new in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 My speaker wont charge and i opened it up. Once open i saw a red wire that wad not attached to anything and i cant see where it must go. The inside of the charching port had a plastic inside that also fell out. Where should the wire go and should i replace the entire charging port or can i just put it back?

 @jolsteryes you will need to replace the charging port. Obviously it is soldered to the board so you will need to have the right tools to replace it. Check digikey.com or mouser.com for replacements. You'll need to do some searching for it but it looks like a standard connector.
As for your red wire. It looks like it is on your board so the other end will either have to go to a switch, the battery or the speaker itself. On picture number 1 it looks like there is only one wire connected to the speaker. May need a clearer picture..

 The read wire is the fm antenna. Leave the other end free, unconnected.

 it is an antena for the bleutooth

 Anyone got a circuit diagram on this equipment please.
