If you're in the market for a new refrigerator, you may be considering a Hisense Fridge Freezer. After all, this brand is known for producing affordable and high-quality appliances. However, before making your purchase, you may want to hear about a recent incident involving a Hisense Fridge Freezer.

One family purchased a Hisense Fridge Freezer 1 1/2 years ago and noticed that it started making strange noises. After contacting the manufacturer, they were informed that the compressor had failed and needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, the warranty had just expired, and the cost of the repair was substantial.

After doing some research, they discovered that they were not alone in their experience. Many other Hisense Fridge Freezer owners had reported similar compressor failures after a short period of use. This prompted us to investigate this issue further.

We found that compressor failure is a common problem across all refrigerator brands. However, Hisense Fridge Freezer is particularly susceptible to this issue. Many users reported that their Hisense Fridge Freezer compressor failed after only a few months of use. This can cause the fridge to stop cooling, which can lead to food spoilage and health risks.

So, what causes a compressor to fail? There are several reasons, including:

1. Lack of maintenance: Your fridge needs regular maintenance to keep it in good working order. Failure to clean the condenser coils, replace the air filter, and check the door gaskets can lead to compressor failure.

2. Overuse: Using your fridge too often or keeping the door open for extended periods can cause the compressor to work more than it should. This can lead to the compressor overheating and eventually failing.

3. Voltage spikes: Power surges can cause damage to electrical appliances, including refrigerators. These surges can occur during thunderstorms or when there is an issue with the power grid.

To prevent compressor failure, you should take good care of your fridge. Some maintenance tips include:

1. Cleaning the condenser coils: Dust and dirt can accumulate on the condenser coils, making it difficult for the fridge to cool. Use a vacuum cleaner to remove any debris.

2. Replacing the air filter: The air filter needs to be replaced periodically to maintain good airflow.

3. Checking the door gaskets: Over time, door gaskets can become worn and inefficient in sealing in the cold air. If you notice any cracks or leaks, replace them immediately.

4. Avoid overuse: Try to limit the number of times you open the fridge door and avoid keeping it open for too long.

In conclusion, while a Hisense Fridge Freezer may be a great purchase in terms of affordability, it's important to remember that regular fridge maintenance is key to keeping it operational. If you already own a Hisense Fridge Freezer, keep an eye out for any unusual noises or other signs that the compressor may be failing. If you do experience any issues, contact the manufacturer immediately to see if they can assist you with repairs.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi i have hisense fridge freezer  1 1/2 year old  stop cooling and freezing  compressor working  it is hot to touch fan  working  too I cleaned coil condenser  seems like working  but not cooling  and freezing  please help me to find the problem

 Hi @me321 ,
If the compressor is too hot to touch and the evaporator is not icy cold, then there most probably is a problem with the sealed system. A lack of refrigerant, a blockage or a faulty compressor.
Check the warranty on the refrigerator. Most manufacturers give a 12 month full parts and labour warranty on the refrigerator and a 5 year parts only warranty on the sealed system. The sealed system includes the compressor, the evaporator, the condenser and associated piping etc.
Check for any oil residues below the compressor or on/below the condenser coils. If there this indicates a refrigerant leak.  A special oil is mixed in with the refrigerant to lubricate the compressor. If there is a leak, the refrigerant will escape to the air undetected, but the oil will leave a trace.
Also depending on your location, you may need a licenced repairer to check the sealed system due to the environmental regulations regarding the handling of refrigerant gases. Where I am you cannot even buy any refrigerant gas if necessary to recharge the system for any reason, without the specified licence.
What is the model number of the refrigerator?
