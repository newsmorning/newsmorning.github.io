## Chosen Solution
 Will not power on, does it need reset

 Hi @pipster67 ,
Do you mean that it shows that there is no power connected to the machine or that it won’t start?
If there is no indication of power to the machine, have you checked that the wall power outlet is working OK?
If it is then looking at the parts available for the machine then either the mains inteference filter or perhaps the On/Off switch may be the problem.
If there is power present and it won’t start, then try to reset the machine by switching it off  (if on) and disconnecting the power from the machine for about 5 minutes and then reconnecting the power and check if it starts when turned on.
If still no good then it may be the door interlock or perhaps the control panel.
