Title: You Won't Believe What This iPhone 7 Plus User is Missing – and It's Causing Major Light Sensor Issues!

Introduction:

The iPhone 7 Plus has been one of the most popular smartphones to hit the market, and for good reason. With its sleek design, advanced camera technology, and state-of-the-art display, it's no wonder why people can't seem to put it down. However, despite all of its advanced features, some iPhone 7 Plus users are experiencing major light sensor issues that are leaving them scratching their heads.

Body:

One such user is a man named John, who has been struggling with his iPhone 7 Plus for months now. Whenever he tries to take a photo, the camera flash automatically turns on and washes out the entire image. He's also noticed that his phone's display is much dimmer than it used to be, even when he's in bright sunlight. Frustrated, John took his phone into the Apple store to see if they could fix the issue. But to his surprise, the solution was something incredibly simple – he was missing a small piece of plastic that was covering his phone's light sensor!

According to the technician at the Apple store, the iPhone 7 Plus's light sensor is located directly next to the front-facing camera on the top of the phone, and is responsible for adjusting the screen's brightness based on the amount of ambient light in the environment. However, if the sensor is exposed to too much light at once (such as from the camera flash), it can become overwhelmed and malfunction, leading to the issues John was experiencing.

Luckily, this issue is an easy fix. All John had to do was locate the missing plastic piece (which had likely fallen off when he removed a previous phone case), and place it back over the sensor. Now, his phone's camera works perfectly, and the display is back to its usual brightness levels.

Conclusion:

It's amazing how something as small as a missing piece of plastic can cause such major issues on a high-tech device like the iPhone 7 Plus. However, it's important to remember that even the most advanced technology can be affected by small, seemingly insignificant details. If you're experiencing issues with your iPhone 7 Plus's light sensor, be sure to check for any missing or damaged components, and don't be afraid to take it to a professional for assistance. With a little bit of troubleshooting, you can get your phone back to working properly – and capture all of those perfect photos with ease!

## Chosen Solution
 When I replaced my phone yesterday with an oem screen I realize that the light sensor didn’t work anymore. The auto brightness adjustment in my setting is on and I’ve tried to pin my phone to a light bulb, nothing. Also my flex cables and everything are in place perfectly and screwed in  right. Then I did the research and found out that I was missing this rectangular shaped white film that was supposed to be in front of the light sensor. I just wanna know if that is what is causing the problem or maybe it’s a defective sensor. If it is the white film, where can I buy them?

 If you still have your old screen, installing it on your iPhone together with the front cam flex. Home button doesn’t have to be transfered for the phone to function. If it does work, you’ll know that the problem was the missing film. If not, your front camera flex might’ve been damaged while removing it. The sensor is not attached very tightly so it can break off of the cable quite easily.

 Phone may not boot and the screen may not even work without the home button connected.
Are you 100% clear that it is the light sensor not working or the proximity sensor?
I have never seen that white film on any of the screens I have replaced.  Try this app to test which sensors are working.  I am not sure, but the camera may be the one that is used for the light sensor.
The app is free and brilliant.
