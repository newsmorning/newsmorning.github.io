# Amazing Trick to Clean Up Your Loop Hero Inventory: Say Goodbye to Unwanted Items Once and for All!

Do you find yourself struggling with a cluttered inventory in Loop Hero? Do you often find yourself wondering how to get rid of those unwanted items taking up valuable slots? Worry no more, as we’ve got the perfect trick to help you clean up your inventory and leave only the most important items.

Loop Hero is a game of strategy and resource management; it’s essential that you have space in your inventory for the necessary resources. However, with so many items flooding your inventory, it can be challenging to manage your resources effectively. So, without any further ado, let's get into it.

## Step 1: Understand Your Inventory

Your inventory is composed of three major categories: equipment, cards, and resources. Each of these items plays a critical role in the gameplay, and you should decide which items are essential and which ones can be discarded. Simply put, keep the essential items and get rid of the unwanted ones.

## Step 2: Selling or Dismantling

Once you have identified the items that you no longer need, the next step is to decide how you will dispose of them. You can either dismantle them or sell them to the vendor. Dismantling equipment gives you resources, while selling them will give you gold. Additionally, you can also discard unnecessary cards, which take up valuable slots in your inventory.

## Step 3: Prioritize Resource Management

It is crucial to manage your resources effectively to survive in the game. Therefore, prioritize the items that will help you in the long run. It’s essential to keep a stock of resources like food, potions, and materials for camp upgrades. The cards that offer rare resources like Oblivion and Meteorite should also be given due consideration. Simply put, focus on the items that will help you in the long run, not just for the current loop.

## Step 4: Avoid Overloading Your Inventory

Overloading your inventory with multiple items can be tempting in the beginning. However, it can leave you struggling to manage your resources later on. The key is to keep your inventory balanced and managed efficiently. It’s also important to consider resetting your inventory if you are feeling overwhelmed with too many items. Resetting will give you a clean slate, allowing you to focus on the critical items required for a particular loop.

## Conclusion

Keeping your inventory clean and clutter-free can be challenging in games like Loop Hero. However, with the right strategy in place, you can manage your resources effectively and survive for longer. The four steps outlined above will help you prioritize your inventory and make the most of the available slots. By prioritizing your resources and items, you can say goodbye to unwanted items once and for all!

Loop Hero came as a surprise to all fans of 16bit RPG games. Its automated battle and the crawling system are something different from the games we played before. In this game, you only can control the loop that your hero takes. You may place cards along the way making the loop but easier or difficult with more enemies along the way. Killing more enemies will grant you more gears, weapons, and items. But limited inventory space in Loop Hero means you have to choose what to use and which items to get rid of. So today let us look at how to remove & delete items from inventory in Loop Hero.
 
## How to Remove & Delete Items From Inventory in Loop Hero
 

 
Removing items from inventory in Loop Hero is an automated process just like the auto-playing of the game. This means all your old items will be automatically deleted and converted to scraps once you gather new resources. This is the same for the items you replace from inventory. Once you replace any item or gear you equipped with the much better version of it, the old item will be automatically deleted and turned in scarps. The old items will be pushed out of your inventory ( bottom right items first) and will be turned into collectible resources which you can use in your base for upgrading the building and other resource-consuming things. This is very useful in getting ready for your first boss battle with Lich, and getting rid of items in Loop Hero.
 
As your inventory is only able to hold 12 items at any given point, you will find them pushed out of your inventory as new items are added to you. So keeping this in mind, you need to check every new item you receive to always equip the best item with stats from the inventory. This process is very convenient as the inventory saves time for your future expansion the more you explore the world and play the same loop over and over again.
 
That’s basically everything you need to know about how to remove items from inventory in Loop Hero. While you are here, check out more of our Loop Hero Guides for more guides with exciting secrets and tips.
