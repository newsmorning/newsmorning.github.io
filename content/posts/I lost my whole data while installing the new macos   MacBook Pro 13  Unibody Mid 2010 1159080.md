Imagine starting your day with the excitement of finally upgrading your Mac to macOS Big Sur 11.2, only to find out that your precious data, essential documents, and personal files were wiped out during the installation. How heartbreaking and devastating this could be.

Unfortunately, this is a nightmare that many Mac users have experienced at one point. The cause of this disaster usually lies in user negligence or a bug in Apple's software. In either case, the damage is done, and the next course of action is data recovery.

If you're one of the unfortunate Mac users who have experienced data loss due to macOS installation, do not panic. Here are some steps you can take to recover your lost data.

1. Stop Using The Mac

The first thing you should do when you detect data loss during macOS installation is to stop using your Mac immediately. Continued use of your Mac could overwrite the lost data, making it irretrievable.

2. Restart Your Mac In Safe Mode

Restart your Mac and activate Safe Mode. To do this, press and hold the Shift key when the Mac starts up. This will start your Mac in safe mode, and from there, you can troubleshoot any issues with your macOS installation.

3. Check Your iCloud Account

If you're an iCloud user, check your account to see if any of your lost data is available there. You can check iCloud Drive, iCloud Photos, or any other iCloud-enabled app to see if your lost data is in the cloud.

4. Recovery Mode

If you can't recover your data from your iCloud account, you can also try using Recovery Mode. Restart your Mac while holding down the Command + R keys. This mode will allow you to reinstall the macOS without losing any additional data.

5. Bring In Professionals

If none of the above solutions work, you may have to consult with professionals to recover your lost data. They have the necessary tools and experience to retrieve your lost data in most cases.

Conclusion

The loss of your precious data during macOS installation can be devastating, but there are steps you can take to recover your lost data. Remember to stop using your Mac immediately, check your iCloud account, use Safe Mode, or Recovery Mode to troubleshoot any issues, and consult with professional data recovery services. With these steps, you can get back your data and continue working without any worries.

## Chosen Solution
 I lost all my data while installing new MacOs ... any way to get all the data back including my Safari bookmarks password and everything?

 If you never reinstalled macOS you may be able to partition recovery or recover files using some software or bootable partition manager.
I think EaseUS do Macbook recovery software, I have got a few things back from customers using their free version :)
Other than that it is likely that your data is gone unless you hold time machine backups or cloud backups
