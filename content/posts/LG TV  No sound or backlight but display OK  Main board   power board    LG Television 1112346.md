# Is Your LG TV Blacking Out? Discover the Surprising Main and Power Board Fix Now!

As much as we love to enjoy our favorite shows and movies on our LG TVs, the unexpected horror of blacking out is far from delightful. The TV, just like any other electronic device, may experience issues that result in frequent and frustrating blackouts that can ruin your watching experience.

The problem could stem from the power board or the main board, which are responsible for running the display and sound components of your LG TV. Both boards work in tandem to provide the ultimate audiovisual experience.

Thankfully, this problem is not insurmountable. In some cases, all you need is a reboot, but when it persists, it might require an astute fix. Here's a quick rundown of what to do if you discover your LG TV is blacking out:

## Check Your Power Source

Sometimes, the issue could merely be a fluctuation or inconsistency in your power source. To confirm this, unplug your TV, wait for several minutes, and plug it back in. If that doesn't work, check if other electronic devices in your home are working correctly. If they are not, the power source might be the issue. In contrast, if they are, then your LG TV's power board is likely the culprit.

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting is the next step you should take once you determine whether the issue is the power source of the TV. When blackouts persist, you can troubleshoot by checking the power board and main board. These two components are responsible for delivering power to the TV's critical circuitry components, including the backlight and audio function.

## Power Board Fix

A failing power board is the most common cause of blackouts on an LG TV. To fix it, inspect the board for any visible signs of damage, like leaking capacitors or bent pins. If the board looks okay, use a multimeter to check for continuity. If you discover that the power board is faulty, consider replacing it with a suitable LG power board.

## Main Board Fix

If the power board checks out, the issue could lie with the main board. A failing main board could cause blackouts, no sound, or even picture distortion issues. To fix the main board, start by inspecting it for any visible damage or possible short circuits. If there are none, remove the board and check the electronic components for continuity. Here again, if you discover a flaw, replacing it with an LG main board that matches your TV model could do the trick.

## Conclusion

LG TVs are advanced electronics that provide excellent audio and visual experiences. Like many other smart TVs, LGs can also develop occasional blackouts that require savvy troubleshooting to fix. When your LG TV blacks out, the power board or the main board could be the culprit. The fixes outlined here require minimal technical skills and attention to detail, helping you save money in the long run. Remember, when in doubt, always seek the help of a professional. Otherwise, you risk causing more damage to your LG TV.

 Hi
I have an LG42LB550V TV. The backlight and sound does not function. If I shine a vright light on the screen I can see that the display is fine. (an image can be seen)
Before I order spares do I need a power board or a main board?
Thanks

 @arkham24601 the inverter circuity is on your power board. Let us know what chassis your TV is so we can look for any ideas about what may have failed on the board.
Update (06/10/2017)
The really determination for which board to replace would depend on the voltage measurements on your power board.

If the voltages are good, it's your mainboard. If they are not, it's your power board.

Let us know what you find.
