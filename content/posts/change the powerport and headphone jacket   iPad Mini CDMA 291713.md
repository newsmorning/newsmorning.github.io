 Daniel Berntsson there is not enough room to change the design. the headphone jack etc. use flat ribbon cables that would need to be redsigned to move the jack anywhere but where it currently is. Check this out. You may have to incorporated the current location into your design. It will be a lot easier than what you are currently thinking off.
