# You Won't Believe How 5 Simple Tips Can Turn You Into a Microsoft Office Pro!

Microsoft Office is a suite of productivity tools that have become a standard in the workplace. It's the go-to software for creating documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and much more. However, not everyone knows how to make the most out of this powerful software. If you're looking to become a Microsoft Office Pro, here are five simple tips to help you get started.

## Tip #1: Learn Keyboard Shortcuts

One of the easiest ways to become more efficient and proficient in Microsoft Office is to learn keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts can save you time and reduce the strain on your wrists and fingers. They're also more precise than using a mouse, which can be a real advantage in certain situations.

For instance, here are some keyboard shortcuts that you can use in Word:

- Ctrl + C: Copy
- Ctrl + V: Paste
- Ctrl + X: Cut
- Ctrl + S: Save
- Ctrl + A: Select All

## Tip #2: Master Formatting

Another essential aspect of Microsoft Office is formatting. Formatting is what makes your documents look professional and presentable. If you want to become a Microsoft Office Pro, you need to learn how to format your documents effectively.

Here are some formatting tips for Word:

- Use styles: Styles help you maintain consistency throughout your document. By using styles, you can ensure that your headings, subheadings, and body text all look the same.
- Use tables: Tables are an easy way to organize data in Word. They're especially useful when you need to present complex information.
- Use bullets and numbering: Bullets and numbering can make your documents more readable and easy to understand.

## Tip #3: Customize Your Settings

Microsoft Office has a lot of customizable settings that can help you work more efficiently. For instance, you can customize the toolbar to include only the commands you use most often. You can also create keyboard shortcuts for your favorite commands.

Here are some customization tips for Excel:

- Create custom views: If you work with large spreadsheets, you can create custom views to show only the information you need.
- Customize the Quick Access Toolbar: The Quick Access Toolbar is a customizable toolbar that appears above the ribbon. You can add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar for quick access.
- Use macros: Macros are a set of commands that you can record and play back. Macros can save you time and reduce tedious tasks.

## Tip #4: Use Collaboration Tools

One of the best things about Microsoft Office is its collaboration tools. With Microsoft Office apps like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, you can collaborate with others in real-time. This means you can work on the same document with your colleagues, even if you're not in the same room.

Here are some collaboration tips for PowerPoint:

- Share your presentation: You can share your presentation with others by uploading it to the cloud. This lets your colleagues view and edit your presentation in real-time.
- Use comments: Comments are an easy way to provide feedback on a presentation. You can leave comments for specific slides or add comments to individual elements like text boxes and images.
- Use co-authoring: Co-authoring allows multiple users to work on the same PowerPoint presentation at the same time. This can save you time and reduce the risk of version control issues.

## Tip #5: Take Advantage of Online Resources

Finally, if you want to become a Microsoft Office Pro, you should take advantage of the many online resources available. There are plenty of blogs, YouTube channels, and online courses that can help you learn everything you need to know about Microsoft Office.

Here are some online resources to check out:

- Microsoft Training Center: The Microsoft Training Center has free online training courses that cover all aspects of the Microsoft Office suite.
- YouTube: There are plenty of YouTube channels that offer tips and tutorials on Microsoft Office.
- Blogs: There are many blogs that cover Microsoft Office tips and tricks. Some of the most popular include Office Blogs, TechNet Blogs, and Microsoft 365 Blog.

Becoming a Microsoft Office Pro doesn't have to be hard. By following these five simple tips, you can take your Microsoft Office skills to the next level. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, there's always something new to learn in Microsoft Office.

Microsoft Office has utterly obliterated the Productivity software arena to the point that competitors consider it a small victory to feature as footnotes. To quote Louis XIV, MS Office is Productivity software and Productivity software is MS Office.
 
The average consumer used to be the get-in-type-a-CV-and-get-out kind of person. But of late, things have changed. Suddenly laptops have become affordable. With more alone time to work on blogs entries, coursework, presentations and all that, knowing how to use MS Office expertly comes in handy.
 
One shouldn’t be afraid to explore for curiosity is the mother of invention as they say. Technology is ever changing; one has to keep up or get left behind. These are some of the ways one can use MS Office like the Pro they are:
 
## Office Online
 

 
Don’t you just love free stuff? I do. Like a lot! Knowing full well that I’d have to fork out $399.99 so I could own the Office suite, naturally I have to look elsewhere. But not too far this time.
 
Microsoft Office is just too awesome and head over shoulders above the competition. Office Online (formerly Office Web Apps) is a toned down free web browser-based version of the Office Suite that has unbelievably been around for a couple of years.
 
Users can create and edit files using Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. And all this without paying a dime! What more can you ask for?
 
## Online integration
 
The future in tech of late appears to be Cloud computing. Most current apps and software released now includes online integration and Microsoft has been at the forefront of this revolution.
 
Office 365 has been heavily marketed and it’s making inroads though not in the developing world. Frankly, most users are more accustomed to desktop software at least for the time being.
 
Office 2019  includes features such as saving files onto OneDrive, posting directly to a blog (WordPress, Blogger) and emailing files directly from Office. Office Suite 2019 is all about Cloud computing providing integration with Skype, Bing, OneDrive to scratch the surface.
 
## Office Store
 
Microsoft has repackaged the add-ins feature renaming it Apps. They have also taken the initiative and created the Office Store where a user can download any number of useful apps to increase the functionality of Office.
 
Apps such as Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Translator and Abbreviation List feature prominently alongside WordCalc and TaskIt all geared towards providing those specialised features for better productivity. Be sure to check out the whole list online for what suits you.
 
## Translation services
 
The in-built Mini Translator can translate text written in a different language. Offline translation of text in Office only works when more than one language has been added to the system (unless a translation app has been downloaded).
 
Entire file translation requires an online service or app and much as nothing beats a human translator, this service is quite neat.
 
## File Protection
 
Microsoft Office includes file protection features that can come in handy when a user has to share files. The protection features include password protection, restrictions on editing and access.
 
A file can be marked as final thereby making it read only. Another feature that can be used to protect a document includes Track Changes, especially useful for documents worked on by more than one individual.
 
Changes can be accepted or rejected allowing for reverting to the previous state of the document.
 
## Bonus tip: Smartphone apps
 
Microsoft has been kind enough to develop free full-fledged MS Office apps for Android, iPhone, Windows phone and tablets. The aforementioned online integration means that one can work on their document on phone, laptop and online and never miss a beat. How awesome does it get!
