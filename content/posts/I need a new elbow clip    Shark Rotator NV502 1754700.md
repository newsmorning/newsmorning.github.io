Title: Shocking Revelation: The Surprising Reason Why Your Shark Rotator Nv502 Needs a NEW Elbow Clip!

Introduction:

If you're an owner of Shark Rotator Nv502, and you've experienced a frustrating loss of suction power, or you've noticed that your vacuum cleaner has started to make an unusual noise, there's a good chance that your elbow clip needs to be replaced. This seemingly small part plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth functioning of your vacuum cleaner. In this article, we explore why the elbow clip is essential for the proper functioning of your Shark Rotator Nv502 and how a faulty elbow clip can impact your machine’s performance.

Body:

The elbow clip is a small but vital component of the Shark Rotator Nv502. It connects the hose to the vacuum's main body, and it ensures that the dust and debris are suctioned up and collected in the dustbin. However, over time, the elbow clip can become worn or damaged, which can compromise the suction power of the machine. When this happens, the vacuum cleaner can't pick up dirt and debris as effectively, and it may struggle to function correctly. This is a common problem that many Shark Rotator Nv502 owners face, especially if they've had the machine for several years.

Another issue that a faulty elbow clip can cause is a noisy vacuum cleaner. When the elbow clip is damaged, it can create air leaks that result in an unusual noise being emitted from the machine. This can be very frustrating for the user and can make vacuuming a more unpleasant experience than it needs to be.

Fortunately, replacing the elbow clip is a simple and affordable process. Shark Rotator Nv502 owners can purchase a replacement elbow clip online or in-store, and they can easily install the new part themselves. By taking this step, they can restore the suction power of their machine and enjoy a quieter cleaning experience.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the elbow clip is an essential component that plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Shark Rotator Nv502. It is often overlooked, but it can cause significant problems if it becomes worn or damaged. If you're experiencing loss of suction or a noisy vacuum cleaner, it's worth checking the elbow clip to see if it needs a replacement. By doing so, you'll be able to restore your Shark Rotator Nv502 to its optimum performance level and make your cleaning experience hassle-free.


## Chosen Solution
 The clip that attaches the elbow  to the body of the vacuum and the hose is broken off. I Need a new one and can not find it in the parts lists. Whats it called and am I able to buy a new one?

 Same happened to me and I wound up using two zip ties to secure it in place.  Works just like normal.

 I found some on eBay for $8. It’s called a lower hose latch on there.

 The clip without the spring actually worked and held the elbow in place I would use it in combination with a zip tie to insure the elbow seats properly

 It’s called a rear hose swivel valve and latch. 
Shark does not sell it. Found it used for 40. Knock off for 28. Crazy prices. Have not purchased.
Update (01/10/2020)

this is the item

 Hose reel swivel spring. Took me days to find out what that part was called

 Shark doesn’t sell a replacement.  I designed one and put it up on eBay for $8 plus shipping.  I send two pieces (since it’s easy to break it while installing) and a replacement spring, since those tend to go flying.  People seem pretty happy with them.https://www.ebay.com/itm/124766956799Makes me mad when companies don’t sell a replacement for small, easily breakable parts on relatively expensive items.  Just adds to the landfills.

 There is someone on ebay who apparently made the piece and sell them for $8.00 plus shipping. However I also used a wide heavy zip tide and it works perfectly.
