# You Won't Believe the Simple Feature I Didn't Notice Was Missing on My Nexus 7!

When I got my Nexus 7 tablet, I was thrilled. It was lightweight, compact, and just the right size for reading, browsing, and even doing some light work when I was on the go. But after a few days of using it, I noticed something strange – there was no light sensor!

I couldn't believe it. How was it possible that a tablet released in 2013, with all the latest features and technology, didn't have a light sensor? It seemed like such a simple and basic feature, one that even my old phone from 2009 had.

At first, I didn't think it was a big deal. After all, I could manually adjust the brightness of the screen by going into the settings. But I quickly realized how much of a hassle it was. Every time I moved from a bright area to a dimly lit one, or vice versa, I had to go into the settings and adjust the brightness accordingly. It was annoying and time-consuming.

I started to do some research and found out that the Nexus 7 wasn't the only device without a light sensor. In fact, many other tablets and even some smartphones didn't have this feature. But why? Was it really that expensive or difficult to include a tiny sensor that could automatically adjust the screen brightness?

As it turns out, the lack of a light sensor is not just an inconvenience for users. It can also have a negative impact on battery life. When the screen is constantly set to a high brightness level, it uses more power and drains the battery faster. On the other hand, if the screen is always set to a low brightness level, it can be hard to see in bright environments, causing eye strain and discomfort.

So why do some manufacturers choose to omit the light sensor from their devices? It's likely a combination of factors, including cost, size, and design constraints. The light sensor requires additional hardware and software, which can add to the production costs of a device. It also takes up space inside the device, which can be a problem for smaller or thinner devices.

But despite these factors, I still believe that the light sensor is an essential feature that should be included in all devices. By automatically adjusting the brightness based on ambient light levels, it makes using the device more convenient, comfortable, and energy-efficient.

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a new tablet or smartphone, I highly recommend checking if it has a light sensor. It may seem like a small feature, but it can make a big difference in your daily use and enjoyment of the device. And if you already have a device without a light sensor, don't despair – there are apps available that can help you automate the brightness adjustment process and save you time and hassle.

## Chosen Solution
 Nexus 7 2012. Purchased a replacement battery from this site. Installed it according to the instructions. Put the tablet on a charger for 10 hours. No indication it was charging and after 10 hours tablet would not boot.  Put the failing original battery back  in, tablet booted. There must be something I’m missing. What does it take to get the tablet to recognize a new battery?

 Hi,
If the original battery when reinserted shows that it is charging and the tablet will boot from it and the replacement battery doesn’t show that it is even charging then it appears that the problem is with the replacement battery.
If you have a DMM (digital multimeter) use it to do a static comparison test between the two batteries. (static testing means no voltage is applied to the component under test)
With both batteries disconnected, use the DMM’s Ohmmeter function and test between the black wire and the yellow wire on the battery cable plug and then between the black wire and the white wire on the cable plug and check if the measurements for both the batteries are the same or very similar. If not then the battery management circuit in the replacement battery is most probably faulty. If one of the test measurements on the replacement battery indicates an open circuit then there may be a wiring problem between the battery and the battery cable plug
If both the batteries have the same or very similar test measurements, then change to the Voltmeter function in the DMM and measure the voltage across the red and black wires for both the batteries and check the voltage. The replacement battery should have some vestige of voltage in it. If no voltage is present it may be depleted beyond recovery or there is a wiring problem from the battery to the cable plug.
If you don’t have a DMM contact ifixit on support@ifixit.com and tell them that the replacement battery doesn’t work and that the failing original still does when reinserted and get a replacement.
