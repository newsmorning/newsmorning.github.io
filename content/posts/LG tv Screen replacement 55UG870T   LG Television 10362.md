Introduction:
If you are facing issues with your LG TV screen, you might be tempted to replace it or call in a professional to fix it. However, before you spend your hard-earned money on such services, there's one simple DIY hack you can try to revive your TV screen.

Body:
The DIY hack involves using a common household item that you might already have in your kitchen- a suction cup. Yes, you read that right! A suction cup can help you fix a dysfunctional LG TV screen.

Here's how you can proceed with this hack:

Step 1: Turn off the TV and unplug it from the socket to ensure your safety.

Step 2: Examine the screen closely to locate spots or lines that are not displaying properly.

Step 3: Take a suction cup and gently press it onto the problematic area on the screen.

Step 4: Apply light pressure and move the suction cup in a circular motion around the spot or line that needs fixing.

Voila! Your LG TV screen is now back to its former glory, all thanks to a simple suction cup. This DIY hack works because sometimes, the connectivity between the screen and the display panel gets disrupted due to air pockets or small particles that get stuck in between. Applying light pressure with a suction cup can help remove these obstructions and restore the connectivity.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, fixing your LG TV's screen has never been easier with this simple DIY hack. It's a cost-effective and quick solution that anyone can implement at home without any technical expertise. So, the next time you face a screen issue, grab a suction cup and try this hack before you spend money on expensive repairs or replacements.

## Chosen Solution
 LG tv 55UG870T damaged screen can it be replaced with the screen from 55UJ634T model.

 Since screen replacements are not usually worth the repair cost, little information is available publicly about them.  From the nature of your question, I surmise that you have both TVs with different problems.  If this is the case, the best way to make this determination is to open up both TVs and look at the model numbers of the panels themselves.  You can also check to see what the connectors and cables look like.  While interchanging panels is rare, you may get lucky.  If you have questions, post pictures of both panels (from the back to show any identifying numbers).
