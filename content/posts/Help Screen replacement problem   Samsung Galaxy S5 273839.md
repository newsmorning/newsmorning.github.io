You Won't BELIEVE the Nightmare I Faced When Replacing My Samsung Galaxy S5 Screen - Can YOU Help Me?

It all started when my Samsung Galaxy S5 slipped out of my hand and took a hard fall on the pavement. The screen was shattered, and I knew I had to get it replaced pronto. After some initial research, I decided to take on the task myself, rather than go to a professional.

I scoured the internet for advice on how to replace a Samsung Galaxy S5 screen, and found plenty of YouTube videos and online tutorials. Armed with a replacement screen and the necessary tools, I set about taking apart my phone with the confidence of a seasoned tech expert.

But my confidence proved to be misplaced, and what followed was a nightmare of epic proportions.

Firstly, the screen I'd ordered turned out to be faulty, so I had to wait for a replacement to arrive before I could even get started. When it finally arrived, I was ready to tackle the job again.

But things quickly took a turn for the worse. As I was trying to disconnect a ribbon cable, my fingernail slipped and tore it. This meant that I had to shell out for yet another replacement part. In addition, disassembling the phone had left me with a pile of tiny screws and other parts that I had no idea how to reassemble correctly.

I tried in vain to put the phone back together, but the screen remained stubbornly unresponsive, and I was left with a phone that was now worse off than before.

It was at this point that I realized my mistake: I should have listened to the advice of other DIY phone repairers and sought out some professional help. In my quest to save a few dollars by doing it myself, I ended up wasting time, money and my phone.

If you find yourself in a similar predicament, don't make the same mistake I did. Save yourself the hassle and the headache by taking your phone to a professional who knows what they're doing.

In conclusion, although the satisfaction of a DIY project can be great, sometimes it's best to leave things to the professionals. In the case of repairing a Samsung Galaxy S5 screen, it's always worth investing in professional help to save yourself from the nightmare I faced.

## Chosen Solution
 I did a screen replacement and everything works when i attach the new screen (the connector piece) but when i try to glue the screen onto the phone it goes black or has no backlight ?!.

 There is either damage present on the flex cable, the connector for the display is coming loose when laying the screen down, or something on the back of the display flex cable is grounding out on the frame and causing the no display issue. I would compare the back of the new screen to the back of the old one (if not completely destroyed) to ensure that they look the same and the new one isn't missing any type of tape or covering.
