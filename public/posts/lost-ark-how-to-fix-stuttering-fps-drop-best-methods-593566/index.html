Here’s how:\nOpen Lost Ark and go to the settings menu Click on the graphical settings option Adjust the settings according to your computer specs Save the settings and restart the game 2. Update your drivers Another reason you might be facing lag during your gameplay might be outdated drivers on your computer. It’s essential to have your drivers updated regularly to ensure a smooth gaming experience in Lost Ark. Here’s how to update your drivers:\nOpen your settings menu and click on the device manager option Locate the drivers for your GPU and other hardware Right-click on them and click on the update drivers option Install the latest update for your drivers. 3. Increase your RAM Sometimes, having high graphic settings in a game can require a lot of RAM to run smoothly. Therefore, it’s necessary to ensure you have enough space on your computer before playing Lost Ark. Here’s how to increase your RAM:\nOpen your PC settings menu Locate the memory settings option Adjust the memory allocation to increase your RAM Save the settings and restart your PC 4. Disable background apps Another reason you may be facing glitches while playing Lost Ark could be due to background apps running on your computer. These apps can consume a lot of resources and slow down your system, leading to lags in your gameplay. Here’s how to disable background apps:\nOpen your task manager Locate the apps running in the background Right-click them and click the end task option Restart your game to enjoy a smooth gaming experience. By applying these fixes, you can ensure a smooth gaming experience while enjoying Lost Ark.

Try these tips and tricks today and unlock the secrets to a smooth gaming experience in Lost Ark!\nHaving a high ping and low FPS can be frustrating in an online game. Adding to the list of annoying occurrences is stuttering and FPS drop in Lost Ark. If you are searching for some ways to minimize and eliminate stutters and boost FPS in this game, here are the best ways to do so.\nLost Ark Stuttering and FPS Drop Fix (PC) These are some of the troubleshooting tips that may work for you if you are getting stutters in Lost Ark.\nLower the Graphics Quality and Display Settings If your texture, shadow, character, and particle quality are set to high, it may be the reason why you are getting stuttering issues. Lower it and test the game to see if you are able to play it without problems on your PC. If your PC is low-end, then it is recommended that you disable the Better Depth of Field and Indirect Shadows. Do check the Anti-Aliasing settings and find out which setting suits you best and avoids stuttering.\nUpdate the Graphics Card Drivers If your graphics card driver is out of date then you need to head over to the official manufacturer’s website and download it from there. You can also uninstall it completely and do a fresh install in case the files had an installation issue. Moreover, don’t forget to edit the settings of the GPU driver to ensure the best performance.\nKeep DirectX Updated to fix Stuttering in Lost Ark You can download the latest version of DirectX from Microsoft here. This will help you figure out if compatibility or corrupted files were the root of the stuttering problem or not.\nClose Other Background Apps This one goes without saying, but make sure you have closed other background programs or applications. Give priority to Lost Ark while playing and you should, ideally, get a better FPS in your gameplay and seamless visual experience. If the Google Chrome browser is running, it will eat up a lot of RAM so end the task from the Task Manager and see if the game works better. Do check if your PC supports the recommended system requirements and has enough RAM (at least 16GB) to run smoothly.\nCheck for Overheating Is your PC getting overheated? This can cause lag and stutters effectively ruining your gaming experience. In case you are using an underpowered CPU or GPU and you don’t have a cooling system that’s working on resolving the heating issues, your game will keep stuttering. Plus, there’s a risk of your PC components getting damaged.\nToggle VSync or FreeSync Sometimes, VSync could create issues related to frame rates, so you can turn it on or off via the NVidia Control Panel.\nType NVIDIA control panel in Windows search bar. Click on Manage 3D settings. Find the Global Setting tab and Vertical Sync. Use the dropdown menu and toggle VSync on or off. AMD users can use FreeSync to reduce and remove stuttering in-game but you will need a FreeSync monitor for it.\nThese were some of the ways to eliminate stuttering in Lost Ark, hopefully, one of the other methods works out for you. If not, check if upgrading your processor or any other component will help you enjoy the game and avoid the interruptions caused by stutters.\nFor more on Lost Ark, explore Gamer Tweak!\n","wordCount":"990","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Charlotte Horne"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/lost-ark-how-to-fix-stuttering-fps-drop-best-methods-593566/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unlock the Secrets to a Smooth Gaming Experience in Lost Ark with These Proven Fixes!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 29, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;990 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Charlotte Horne</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-adjust-your-graphic-settings>1.
