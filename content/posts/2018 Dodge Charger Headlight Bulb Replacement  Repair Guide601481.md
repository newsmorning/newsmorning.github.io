# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Replace Your Dodge Charger Headlight Bulb In 2018 - Our Ultimate Repair Guide Will Blow Your Mind!

Are you tired of driving with a dim or burnt out headlight on your Dodge Charger? Worry no more! Replacing the headlight bulb on a 2018 Dodge Charger is an easy, DIY task that can save you time and money. In this ultimate repair guide, we will walk you through step-by-step instructions on how to replace your Dodge Charger headlight bulb. 

## Tools 

Before getting started, you will need to make sure you have the following tools:

- Replacement headlight bulb (make sure it is compatible with your Dodge Charger’s make and model)
- Gloves
- Screwdriver (optional)
- Clean cloth or towel 

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Open your Dodge Charger’s hood and locate the headlight assembly. Each headlight assembly will have a flat black plastic cover on the back.

2. Remove the plastic cover of the headlight assembly. Depending on the model of your Dodge Charger, this cover may be held in place by clips or screws. Use a screwdriver to remove any screws, or gently pry the clips off the headlight assembly.

3. Unplug the electrical connector from the back of the headlight bulb. To do this, simply press and hold the clip at the bottom of the connector and gently pull the connector away from the bulb.

4. Remove the headlight bulb from the headlight assembly by twisting counterclockwise. Be sure to wear gloves to prevent your skin from coming into contact with the bulb or the oil from your fingers causing it to fail sooner. 

5. Place the new headlight bulb into the headlight assembly and twist clockwise to secure it in place.

6. Reconnect the electrical connector by pushing it back into place and securing it with the clip.

7. Replace the plastic cover of the headlight assembly and secure it in place with either the clips or screws. 

8. Repeat these steps for the other headlight assembly if necessary.

## Tips and Tricks 

- Always wear gloves when handling your headlight bulb. The oil from your fingers can cause the bulb to fail sooner than expected.

- Make sure to choose the correct replacement bulb for your Dodge Charger's make and model.

- Clean the headlight assembly with a cloth or towel before attaching the new bulb to help prevent debris from getting in the assembly. 

- If you’re having trouble seeing how to remove the clips or screws, a flashlight or shining your phone's light on the area might help.

- If you want to avoid removing the plastic cover, some Dodge Chargers have removable caps from the back making the job even easier.
