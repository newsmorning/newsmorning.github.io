## Chosen Solution
 So, I came home from school and I tried turning on my Playstation 3 super slim by  pressing the power button manually on the ps3 but it would stay red for 30 seconds after I press it before it goes green by its self. After it goes green, nothing happens. The disk drive isnt operating, the cpu fan not kicking on. No audio or Graphics on the tv. I tried holding down to power button until I heard 2 or 3 beeps but still nothing. I tried doing the Hard drive removal to see if that was the problem but still no signs of life on the ps3 accept for the green led on the power button. After that I left it Green for a little bit until the green led on the Playstation 3 just goes black like it turned itself off and I still dont know what the problem is. Does anyone know? Thanks.

 Run the fan test. Unplug the PS3, then hold the eject button while plugging it back. The fan will go in airplane mode which is normal, don't worry about it. It should also eject your disc.
Afterwards, you can check if putting a disc in will turn the PS3 on, if not it's most likely a PSU issue
