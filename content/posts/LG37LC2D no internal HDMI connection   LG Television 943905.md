## Chosen Solution
 So someone was getting rid of this tv. I plugged it in and it looked like menus and everything worked, So I attached HDMI.
nothing.
so I opened it up.
it looks like there was NEVER an internal ribbon cable from the board to the HDMI connection.
is this common? If I find and hook up a cable correctly, will it work? Or is it not made for HDMI and the default solder points just standard and the HDMI port is just to close the hole in the back?

 Hi @the_shoffer
According to the TVâ€™s user manual it has HDMI/DVI input capability.
Here are some images taken from the service manual which may give you some idea of where the HDMI fits in.
