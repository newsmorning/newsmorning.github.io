## Chosen Solution
 Hey I have an old Sony KDL-52NX800 and it has lines across the screen and looks pixelated. Aside from it being old I don’t really know what could be wrong. Can anyone help me out? I attached a picture to hopefully give more info

ok here’s the t con. It doesn’t seem to be damaged anywhere.

 John Hricz that looks like either a bad LCD driver board (part of the panel) or a bad T-con, main board. you would need to remove the back cover and check those boards of any obvious damage. Post some good pictures of those boards with your question so that we can see what you see. Adding images to an existing question

 looks like either loose from bord or somthing is wrong with the  t con or display converter so it shows on the sreen that way
