Unbelievable! This Macbook Pro only charges when you STRONGLY tap it! Find out how this miraculous discovery will change the way you use technology!

Have you ever experienced the frustration of a dead laptop battery while in the middle of an important task? Have you ever wished that your laptop charger could work faster and more efficiently? Well, the future of technology is here, and it comes in the form of a miraculous discovery that is sure to change the way you use your Macbook Pro.

In recent years, some users have reported an interesting phenomenon when charging their Macbook Pro. They discovered that their laptop would only charge when they vigorously tap or hit it. This discovery initially seemed strange, but as more people experimented with the idea, the results were consistent: tapping or hitting the laptop, especially near the charging port, increased the charging speed significantly.

So, how does this work? Well, it turns out that the cause of this phenomenon is related to hardware issues within the laptop. The charging port on a Macbook Pro is usually connected to the motherboard via a power management chip. This chip regulates the flow of power from the charger to the battery. However, sometimes this chip can malfunction, leading to slower charging times or even no charging at all. When you tap or hit the laptop, it briefly jolts the power management chip, resetting it and allowing it to work correctly again.

But this is not just some random trick that laptop users will find amusing. The implications of this discovery are huge. If you're constantly on the go and rely on your laptop, then the speed at which your Macbook Pro charges is a crucial factor. This discovery means that you can now charge your laptop much faster, reducing the amount of time you spend tethered to a power outlet. This can be especially helpful in emergency situations when you need to charge your laptop quickly.

Moreover, this discovery could also save you money in the long run. If the cause of the charging issue is related to the power management chip, then you may not need to spend money replacing the charging port or even the battery. By simply tapping or hitting your laptop, you can potentially fix the problem for free or at a minimal cost.

In conclusion, the discovery that your Macbook Pro only charges when you tap or hit it is truly remarkable. It is a testament to the ingenuity of human beings when it comes to making the most out of available resources. This discovery can be a game-changer for people who rely on their laptops for work or play, and it could save you time and money in the long run. So, go ahead, give your Macbook Pro a good tap, and see the difference it makes!

## Chosen Solution
 Hello. I have an early 2011 version. The mac works fine but charges intermittently. I have changed the battery. I have cleaned the contacts and tried another charger. When the magsafe is connected and not charging it still keeps the mac powered and the powered symbol appears in the UI but says not charging. I've done the SMC and PRAM.
What can I do as I don't want to continue to bash the laptop to charge it?
Thanks

 Try changing the actual mag safe board.  They aren't that expensive.  The process shouldn't be too hard since the board is separate from the motherboard and there is no soldering required.
