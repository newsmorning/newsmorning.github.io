#Say Goodbye to Blurry Screens! Learn the Quick and Easy Solution to Fix HiDPI Issues in Windows 10 and 11 in Just 5 Minutes!

Are you tired of dealing with blurry screens on your Windows 10 or 11 computer? HiDPI (High Dots Per Inch) issues are a common problem that many users face when using high-resolution displays. Fortunately, there is a quick and easy solution to fix this problem in just 5 minutes. In this article, we'll show you how to solve HiDPI issues on your Windows 10 or 11 computer.

##What is HiDPI?

HiDPI is a technology that allows displays to show crisper images and text by increasing the number of pixels per inch. This technology is used in high-resolution displays, such as 4K or 5K monitors. However, when using a HiDPI display on Windows 10 or 11, users may encounter blurry screens, apps and icons. 

##Why do HiDPI issues occur?

HiDPI issues occur when Windows scales applications and fonts to compensate for the high resolution of the display. This scaling can create blurry or distorted images, making it difficult to read text or view images. 

##How to fix HiDPI issues in Windows 10 and 11

Follow these steps to fix HiDPI issues on your Windows 10 or 11 computer:

###Step 1: Open the Settings app

Press the Windows key + I to open the Settings app. Alternatively, you can click on the Windows button and select Settings from the menu.

###Step 2: Click on System

In the Settings app, click on System.

###Step 3: Select Display

In the System menu, select Display.

###Step 4: Choose the correct resolution

Under the Scale and Layout section, choose the correct resolution for your display. This will depend on the type of monitor you are using. For example, if you are using a 4K monitor, choose the resolution of 3840 x 2160.

###Step 5: Adjust the scaling

Under the Scale and Layout section, adjust the scaling by moving the slider to the right or left. This will determine the size of the text, apps, and other items on your screen. 

###Step 6: Restart your computer

After making these changes, restart your computer to apply the new settings. 

##Conclusion

HiDPI issues can be frustrating, but with these simple steps, you can say goodbye to blurry screens and enjoy crystal clear display on your Windows 10 or 11 computer. Remember to choose the correct resolution for your monitor and adjust the scaling to get the best results. With just 5 minutes of your time, you can optimize your display and enhance your computing experience.

Having a high resolution display is great, if you need a lot of space while working, or if you want to enjoy in high quality picture, but it has it’s flaws. As much as we love high resolution display, it seems that some users are having HiDPI issues on Windows 10.

HiDPI displays and laptops are relatively new, and just like with every new type of technology there is an adjustment period before software manufacturers optimize their devices for such high resolution displays. If you have HiDPI display or laptop, you might notice some issues such as small menus or blurry text.

This is issue for both software manufacturers and Microsoft, because some software might look normally while certain sections in Windows 10 look bad and vice versa on high resolution display.
 
So what can you do to fix this? We’ll tell right away.
 
## Solutions to fix Windows HiDPI problems
 
### Solution 1 – Control System-Wide Display Scaling
 
If you have high-resolution display or device, Windows 10 will automatically detect the best settings for you. However, this doesn’t always work perfectly so you might want to adjust scaling manually, and here’s a way to do it.
 
- Right click on your Desktop and choose Screen resolution from the menu.
 - Go to “Make text and other items larger or smaller” link and now you’ll be able to set the custom scaling level for your display.

 
In newer versions of Windows 10, you can access these settings by going to the Settings Page > System > Display > Scale and layout, as shown in the screenshot below.
 
It’s worth noting that in Windows 10 changing the custom scaling doesn’t require you to log out and log back in, you can just continue where you left off.
 
Since this is the problem for third-party developers, some applications have blurry fonts when you use scaling. Although Windows 10 enables DPI scaling for all desktop apps, the ones that don’t have high DPI support will have blurry or fuzzy text on certain settings, for example when you set scaling to 200%. Many popular apps have this problem, such as Google Chrome or Steam, but you can somewhat fix this problem.

### Solution 2 – Disable display scaling for specific applications
 
- Find the app that is giving you DPI issues and right click it, then choose Properties from the menu.
 - Go to the Compatibility tab and check Disable display scaling on high DPI settings.
 - Click Apply then OK.

 
Fonts won’t be blurry anymore, but the downside of this method is that some graphical elements of the app might be scaled down. Depending on the application maybe you can change the size of fonts or graphical elements inside it.
 
In addition, you can disable DPI scaling entirely, but that might not be the best solution, since all graphical elements will look smaller.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken.

### Solution 3 – Update your computer
 
Microsoft already rolled out quite a few cumulative updates that packed HiDPI improvements. Make sure that you’re running the latest Windows 10 OS version to benefit from these improvements. Check for updates and install the new updates that are available.

### Solution 4 – Check your GPU settings
 
Your graphics driver may also be the root-cause of the problem. First of all, make sure that you installed the latest GPU driver versions.
 
Then, make sure to set your native resolution as the default value. If these values are lower, this indicates that only the generic driver is being used. You want to use your AMD/NVIDIA/ Intel driver as well.
 
### Solution 5 – Uninstall problematic apps and programs
 
If the HiDPI problems that you’re experiencing concern only specific apps and programs, uninstall and then re-install the problematic tools. This quick workaround may be the answer to your problem.
 
High DPI displays and devices are amazing, but as you can see software isn’t still optimized for them, and there are some issues. It’s up to software developers and Microsoft to optimize their products for final users, but this might take some time.
 
We’re currently waiting for permanent patch from Microsoft that will fix this, and we’re sure that other software developers will slowly but surely optimize their software for HiDPI devices.
