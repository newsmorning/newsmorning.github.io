Are you tired of mediocre audio while gaming, working or streaming on your PC? Look no further than the Logitech Z337 Speakers, which offer impressive sound quality with easy connectivity and a sleek design.\nFirst off, the set up is a breeze. Simply plug in the speakers to your PC or Bluetooth device and you’re ready to go. The Bluetooth connection is seamless and offers a range of up to 15 meters, allowing you to control your audio from across the room.\nThe combination of powerful subwoofer and two satellite speakers delivers crystal clear sound with deep bass that truly immerses you in the experience. The bass is especially impressive, providing a rich, full sound that is often lacking in other PC speakers.\nOne of the biggest advantages of the Logitech Z337 speakers is its versatility. Not only can it be used for your PC, but also for your smartphone, tablet, or any other Bluetooth-enabled device. This means you can enjoy your favorite tunes or podcasts on virtually any device without compromising sound quality.\nThe design of the speakers is also sleek and modern, with a stylish black finish that blends seamlessly with any setting. The control pod allows easy access to volume and Bluetooth pairing, while minimizing the need for wires on your desktop.\nOne downside to note is that while the Z337 speakers are not the most affordable option, they do provide excellent value for money in terms of quality and versatility. Plus, the price point falls within the range of other high-end PC speakers.\nOverall, the Logitech Z337 Speakers are a game-changer when it comes to PC audio. The combination of impressive sound quality, versatility and modern design make it a must-have for gamers, professionals or anyone who wants to enhance their audio experience while using a PC.\nDon’t settle for mediocre audio any longer - upgrade to the Logitech Z337 speakers and immerse yourself in a world of high-quality sound.\nLogitech Z337 Speakers\nInexpensive\nLook nice\nVery small and light\nBluetooth\nRCA Connection\nCables not detachable\nPlastic body\nAverage sound quality\nWhile not the best sounding speakers on the market, the Logitech Z337 offer a good compromise between style, functionality, and sound for computer audio. Design and Accessories Setup Process: Sound Quality Price Competition Final Verdict Specs We purchased the Logitech Z337 Speakers so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.\nFinding a perfect blend between useful features, size, and audio quality is tough for computer speakers, given all the varied tasks they’re used for. The Logitech Z337 speakers aim to find that balance while also working under a very low price tag. They may not have the absolute best sound quality for their price, but they have several advantages over their competition, and they’re good-looking.\nDesign and Accessories: Tiny monsters with lots of character There are few desks that are too small to accommodate the Logitech Z337 speakers. The two satellite speakers are 4.3 inches wide and 3.5 inches deep, about the size of a coaster, and stand short at 7.6 inches. The subwoofer is a little larger, its longest side measuring 9.1 inches, but it’s still small enough to not interfere with legroom.\nThey have a beautiful finish to them, a dark grey sandstone texture, and cloth-covered drivers that will accentuate your decor. Underneath the veneer, the speaker bodies are made of plastic, which isn’t the best material for audio transmission, but at this price point, other materials are hard to come by.\nThe subwoofer is the heart of this set, since it’s the component that connects to power and to the other speakers. All the cables are 5-7 inches in length, although they’re easy to kink and quite flimsy. Unfortunately, the power cable and the control pod cable are permanently attached to the subwoofer, so if they break, repairing the system is much more complicated than just swapping out the bad cable for a new one.\nIf the subwoofer is the heart, the control pod is the brain. This 2-inch puck controls main volume, power on/off, and Bluetooth. The volume knob is big and chunky, very pleasant to use. The control pod also has a headphone input for 3.5mm auxiliary connectors.\nThe speakers’ line inputs are located on the subwoofer: RCA and 3.5mm auxiliary. While the kit comes with an included 3.5mm cable, it’s disappointing Logitech didn’t provide an RCA cable, as well. Setup Process: They’re beginner-friendly, but you’re on your own Setting up the Z337 speakers is easy enough, but there is little in the box to help you get started. The packaging itself has a couple of wordless diagrams, and that’s it. I’ll try to walk you through the setup process, but in case you’re more of a visual learner, Logitech has a more detailed setup guide on their website.\nBefore you start connecting your speakers, you should position them properly for the best sound. You want the satellite speakers to form a triangle with your head, each speaker pointing toward your ears. They should be about as far away from each other as they are from you. The subwoofer should be on the floor, out of the way so you don’t kick it.\nThe wires to connect the speakers to the subwoofer are color-coded, so connect the speakers to the corresponding port. Connect the subwoofer to power. To connect the system to your PC, you have two options: 3.5mm or RCA. You can adjust the subwoofer (bass) volume with the knob on the rear of the subwoofer, but I recommend keeping it at midlevel and adjusting its volume with EQ software to minimize bass distortion. The on/off switch is on the control pod. Finally, if you want to use Bluetooth, press the Bluetooth button on the control pod and connect to “Logitech Z337” on your other device. Sound Quality: An upgrade for the casual listener The Logitech Z337 is no audiophile speakers, but they’re not bad. Music is pleasant to listen to, and dialogue in movies is crisp and clear. Their lack of spatial depth makes them a poor choice for reflex-based games, but they’re still leagued better than your built-in PC speakers. Highs on these speakers are clear and sparkly. The treble has no problem cutting through the rest of the audio, and while it’s not shrill, I found it fatiguing after prolonged use. The bass is pleasantly clear thanks to the subwoofer. If you like a thundering bassline, I recommend keeping the subwoofer’s physical volume at or below 50 percent and EQing the bass volume in software, since the subwoofer distorts at higher volumes. As for the satellites, they also distort at higher volumes, although their max volume is louder than most desk users would ever desire. The mids are these speakers’ weak point, as the 3-inch drivers present a muddy and loose sound. They’re undoubtedly clearer than your integrated PC or monitor speakers, but they notably lack the precision and refinement you can find in bookshelf speakers of the same price. For casual listening, the Z337 speakers are fine, but if you need something more serious, such as for video editing or competitive gaming, you should look elsewhere.\nMusic is pleasant to listen to, and dialogue in movies is crisp and clear. Price: Well priced for its balance of performance and features Competition: The Z337s are jack-of-all-trades, master of none The way these speakers are built, one part fails and the whole system fails with it. The Z337s also lack remarkable audio quality or features for their price, so the competition against it is stiff.\nFor about $80, these speakers are a good basic set that will get the job done.\nSolid speakers for general computer use, but lacking higher-end sound quality. Specs Product Name Z337 Product Brand Logitech SKU 980-001260 Price $100.00 Release Date September 2016 Wired/Wireless Wired Connectivity Options Bluetooth 4.1, RCA, 3.5mm aux Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) 10% Warranty 1 year Limited Number of Channels 2.1 Frequency Response 55Hz-20kHz Input Impedence 10k Ohm Power Output 40W Sound Pressure Level (SPL) 96dBA\nProducts Included Two satellite speakers, Subwoofer, 3.5mm audio cable, User documentation ","wordCount":"1374","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"James Cox"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/logitech-z337-speakers-review-a-decent-upgrade-for-your-pc-audio1183507/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Revolutionize Your PC Audio Experience with Logitech Z337 Speakers - Our Honest Review Will Blow Your Mind!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 7, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1374 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;James Cox</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#heading></a></li><li><a href=#design-and-accessories-tiny-monsters-with-lots-of-character>Design and Accessories: Tiny monsters with lots of character</a></li><li><a href=#setup-process-theyre-beginner-friendly-but-youre-on-your-own>Setup Process: They’re beginner-friendly, but you’re on your own</a></li><li><a href=#sound-quality-an-upgrade-for-the-casual-listener>Sound Quality: An upgrade for the casual listener</a></li><li><a href=#price-well-priced-for-its-balance-of-performance-and-features>Price: Well priced for its balance of performance and features</a></li><li><a href=#competition-the-z337s-are-jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none>Competition: The Z337s are jack-of-all-trades, master of none</a></li><li><a href=#specs>Specs</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=revolutionize-your-pc-audio-experience-with-logitech-z337-speakers---our-honest-review-will-blow-your-mind>Revolutionize Your PC Audio Experience with Logitech Z337 Speakers - Our Honest Review Will Blow Your Mind!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#revolutionize-your-pc-audio-experience-with-logitech-z337-speakers---our-honest-review-will-blow-your-mind>#</a></h1><p>Are you tired of mediocre audio while gaming, working or streaming on your PC?
