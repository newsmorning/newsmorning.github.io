Is Your LG OLED TV a DUD? Find Out Why It Turns On But Has No Picture or Sound!

LG OLED TVs are known for their stunning picture quality and immersive sound experiences. However, nothing is perfect, and sometimes even the best products can have issues. One of the most common problems that LG OLED TV owners face is turning on their TV but finding no picture or sound. This issue can be frustrating, but before you give up and buy a new TV, read on to learn about some common causes and possible solutions to this problem.

One of the main reasons why your LG OLED TV may turn on but have no picture or sound is that it is not properly connected to your cable box, streaming device, or other external device. Make sure that all cables are connected securely and are in the right input ports. Also, check the input settings on your TV to ensure that it is set to the correct input.

Another common cause of this issue is a faulty HDMI cable. HDMI cables are responsible for transmitting audio and video signals between your TV and external devices. A faulty cable can cause the signal to drop, resulting in no picture or sound. Try replacing your HDMI cable with a new one, and see if that fixes the problem.

If you have checked all of the cables and connections and still have no picture or sound, the issue may lie with the software or firmware of your TV. Try resetting your TV to its default settings or updating the firmware. This can sometimes fix software-related issues that cause your TV to have no picture or sound.

Sometimes, your LG OLED TV may have an issue with its internal hardware. For example, the power supply or the display panel may be faulty. In cases like this, it is best to contact LG customer support for assistance. They can diagnose the issue and provide solutions, such as having the TV repaired or replaced.

In conclusion, if your LG OLED TV turns on but has no picture or sound, it may be a simple fix or a more complex issue. Make sure that all of the cables are connected correctly, and try using a new HDMI cable. Reset your TV to its default settings or update the firmware, and contact LG customer support if none of these solutions work. With a little troubleshooting, you can likely fix the issue and get back to enjoying your LG OLED TV's high-quality picture and sound.

The TV still can be turned on by the remote or the power button.  I can hear the click from the  powerboard and the red LED on the mainboard will be on. But no picture no sound. My nintendo switch can turn on the TV via HDMI as it normal dose.
Tried disconnecting speaker, control button and remote receiver one by one noting worked.
Tried disconnected the T con board. The power can be turned on for 2 second and then it will restart it self. And the power stay on for another 2 second before turning off.
Bought a mainboard and put it in, but issues are same.
Tested the power suppy  board.  The power to the mainboard showed in the pictures. The power to the T con board are all 25.1V for the 24V pins and -1.2mV for the GRD pins.
Is there anything I can do? Many thanks.

 @lleei since you already replaced the main board the next logical step is the power board. Post a picture of the complete power board.

@lleei sure looks like a beast. I attached the testing procedure for the power board (don’t let the description fool you it'should work for yours as well), see if you can work through that. The voltages you listed are all good. Do not forget to test all the fuse on the board. If that all pans out we should not forget the T-con board. I wonder if it fails to post and hence no sound/video. It’s uncommon to do that but it is an LG so….
