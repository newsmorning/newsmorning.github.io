# Unleash Your Inner Hero with These Must-Have Items in FFVII Remake - Sold Out Everywhere but Here!

If you're a Final Fantasy VII Remake fan, you're probably aware of how vital preparation is in the game. The initial stages of the game can be challenging, and your success mainly depends on the weapons, accessories, and materia you equip your characters with. With that in mind, here's a list of essential items you should have to unleash your inner hero and come out with flying colors in FFVII Remake.

## Mythril Saber

The Mythril saber is a top-tier weapon that you can acquire by trading the Iron Blade weapon in Chapter 8. This weapon is excellent for a character like Cloud because it has high attack power and speed. It also confers significant bonuses associated with MP consumption.

## Magnify Materia

The Magnify materia is an excellent spell support materia that allows you to cast spells on several targets rather than just one. For instance, if you use the materia to cast Healing, you can heal all your party members simultaneously. You can earn the materia by completing various quests within the game.

## Crescent Moon Charm

The Crescent Moon Charm is a game-changer for any FFVII Remake player. This accessory confers a 10% bonus to every attribute and stat. The charm is obtainable by acquiring three moon pendants and exchanging them with Moggie.

## Chakra Materia

The Chakra materia is an excellent healing materia that you can acquire relatively early in the game. When you equip this materia, your character can cast Chakra, which restores their HP, and if their HP is full, it helps to restore their MP.

## Elemental Materia

The Elemental materia is a supportive materia that allows you to add elemental affinity to your weapon. When you equip the materia, you can add elemental damage to your weapon that suits the enemy you're about to face in combat. This materia is obtainable in the game by completing Chapter 14.

## Earrings

The earrings are a relatively easy-to-acquire accessory in FFVII Remake. You can earn them by completing Chapter 9. These earrings confer a significant bonus to your character's magic stats, which can significantly improve a caster's spellcasting strength.

In conclusion, preparing to take down large monsters and boss battles requires a strategy, and the team at Square Enix did an excellent job of making sure we're not caught off-guard. While the items highlighted above aren't the only ones you can acquire, they're essential in your journey to unleashing your inner hero in Final Fantasy VII Remake. Make sure to add them to your arsenal for real success.
