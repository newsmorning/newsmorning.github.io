Is Your Hisense 55 TV Ruined? Find Out Why It's Getting Lines After Logo!

If you own a Hisense 55 television and have noticed that it's getting lines after the logo, you're not alone. This problem is relatively common among Hisense TV owners, and it can be incredibly frustrating, especially if you're trying to enjoy your favorite TV show or movie.

But why exactly is this happening, and what can you do to fix it?

Well, first of all, let's talk about what causes lines to appear on your TV screen. In most cases, this issue is caused by a faulty connection between the video source and the TV. This could be due to a loose or damaged HDMI cable, a problem with the TV's firmware, or even a hardware malfunction in the TV itself.

So, what can you do to address this issue?

One of the first things you should try is checking your HDMI cable. Make sure that it's properly plugged in and that there are no visible signs of damage. If you find that the cable is loose, try unplugging it and plugging it back in again.

If the problem persists, you may want to try updating your TV's firmware. Hisense TVs typically come with an automatic update feature, so you can check to see if any new updates are available. If there are, make sure to install them and see if the problem goes away.

If neither of these solutions works, it may be time to contact Hisense customer support. They can help you troubleshoot the issue and determine whether or not your TV needs to be repaired or replaced.

In the end, dealing with lines on your Hisense TV screen can be a frustrating experience. However, by taking the time to troubleshoot the issue and explore your options, you can get back to enjoying your favorite shows and movies in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 So it started out as horizontal lines across the bottom.  I re-connected the 2 ribbons to the T-Con board,  and now I get Vertical lines.  I tried doing a software update at the recommendation of Hisense support, but no change.  When you turn the tv on the logo is perfect, no lines,  then within about 10 seconds the vertical lines fade in and stay.  Could it still be a Screen issue if the logo appears perfect?  I’ve ordered a replacement Tcon board on Ebay and will swap it out,  but it seems like it may just be a ribbon issue?
Any thoughts?

 i been fix electronics for 35 years your heading in the right direction with the tcon but you need to resit all the ribbon cables and then there are conductive tabs all around the bezel (frame) that can do this also. be very careful taking the bezel of. i use some very fine sand paper or them green scratcher  pads and slightly buff then they are silver in color and all around the frame good luck

 @jeffbeckib if your logo as well as your onboard menu works and does not show those lines, it is your T-con board that is failing.

 I don’t think it’s an issue with the ribbon cable - if it were, you’d see issues with the image any time the screen is displaying (including the logo at boot up), right?
I’d say go with your plan - swap out the Tcon board.  also, check the ribbon cable connection at the receptacle on the tcon board - I’ve made the mistake of latching the cable while the pins weren’t aligned or fully inserted into the receptacle.   i’m sure you’ve already double checked this :)

 Replaced T-Con board,  still getting all White screen with lines.  disconnected every ribbon and cable to every board, then reconnected all.  Still nothing.   Shouldn’t matter that rear cover is off correct?  Seamore mentioned something about back cover having conductors on it?  I don’t see anything. and I know I’ve had the cover off when I first had the problem and it didn’t change the picture at all.  What started out as a tolerable area of lines at the bottom has not become an unviewable image.
