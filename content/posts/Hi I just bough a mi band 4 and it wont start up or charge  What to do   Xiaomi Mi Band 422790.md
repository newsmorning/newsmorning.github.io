If you own a Xiaomi Mi Band 4, you might have experienced some issues with it, such as not turning on, not charging, or simply not working properly. These problems can be frustrating and can even lead you to believe that your product is a dud. However, before you give up on it, there are ways to revive and fix it without spending a fortune.

Here are some of the most common issues with Xiaomi Mi Band 4 and how to revive and fix them:

**Issue #1: Not Turning On**

If your Xiaomi Mi Band 4 is not turning on, it may be due to a drained battery. The first step to revive it is to charge your device. To do this, use the charging cable that came with your device and connect it to a power source. Make sure the charging pins are aligned properly with the charging port on your device. Keep it charged for at least 30 minutes and try turning it on again.

**Issue #2: Not Charging**

If your device is not charging, it may be due to a faulty charging cable or charging port. The first thing to check is the charging cable to make sure it is not damaged. If it is, replace it with a new one. If your device is still not charging, try cleaning the charging port with a soft, dry cloth to remove any dust or debris that may be preventing a proper connection. You can also try resetting your device by pressing and holding the button for 15 seconds and then trying to charge it again.

**Issue #3: Not Syncing**

If your device is not syncing with your smartphone or is not showing the correct time or notifications, the first step to revive it is to check if it is connected to the Bluetooth on your phone. Make sure it is activated and that your device is close to your phone. You can also try resetting your device by pressing and holding the button for 15 seconds and then pairing it again with your phone.

**Issue #4: Not Registering Steps**

If your device is not counting your steps properly, it may be due to a calibration issue. The first step to revive it is to check if the device is correctly placed on your wrist. It should be snug, but not too tight, and placed on the top of your wrist. You can also try calibrating your device by going to the "More" tab in the Mi Fit app, selecting "Profile," and then "Mi Band 4." From there, select "Sensor settings" and then "Step counting." Follow the instructions on the screen to recalibrate your device.

In conclusion, if you have a Xiaomi Mi Band 4 that is not working properly, don't give up on it just yet. These problems are common and can be easily revived and fixed with the right steps. By following these tips, you can revive your device and make it work again in no time.
