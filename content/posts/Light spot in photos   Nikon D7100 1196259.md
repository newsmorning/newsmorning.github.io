# Uncover the Secret to Capturing Perfect Light Spots in Your Photos with the Nikon D7100!

Are you tired of struggling to capture those perfect light spots in your photos? Whether you're a professional photographer or just an amateur looking to capture great shots, it can be frustrating trying to get the lighting just right. But with the Nikon D7100, you can unlock the secret to capturing perfect light spots every time.

One of the key features of the Nikon D7100 is its 24-megapixel CMOS sensor, which offers high-quality image capture with excellent detail and clarity. Coupled with a powerful EXPEED 3 image processor, this camera is capable of capturing stunning photos in even the most challenging lighting conditions.

To get started, here are a few tips and tricks that will help you make the most of the Nikon D7100's light-capturing capabilities:

1. Experiment with different settings: With the Nikon D7100, you have a wide range of settings to choose from, including ISO, aperture, and shutter speed. So play around with these and see what works best for your particular situation. For example, using a high ISO setting can help you capture those elusive light spots, while a low aperture can give your photos a dreamy, blurred effect.

2. Use the camera's built-in light meter: The Nikon D7100 has a highly accurate 2016-pixel RGB sensor built into the viewfinder, which can help you determine the best exposure settings for your shot. Simply point the camera at your subject and press the shutter button halfway down to activate the meter. Then adjust your settings accordingly until the meter shows the optimal exposure.

3. Learn how to manipulate light: Whether you're shooting indoors or outdoors, there are plenty of ways to manipulate light to get the desired effect. For example, you could use a reflector to bounce light onto your subject, or position your subject in a way that catches the natural light just right.

4. Don't be afraid to experiment: With the Nikon D7100, you have the freedom to experiment with different shooting modes and techniques until you find what works best for you. So don't be afraid to try new things and push the limits of your creativity.

By following these tips and using the Nikon D7100 to its full potential, you can unlock the secret to capturing perfect light spots in your photos every time. So grab your camera, head out into the world, and start capturing those stunning shots that you've always dreamed of!

## Chosen Solution
 I purchased a Nikon D7200 (almost identical to 7100) from a guy on Craigslist and he said it had a sensor scratch, after looking at photos of sensor scratches I don't think that is what it has. When taking photos in daylight at low F stop a light spot appears in the photos. I have tried switching lenses with no change, as the f stop gets higher the spot goes away. What is this and other than replacing the sensor is it fixable?
This photo is UNEDITED

 Whatever it is, the fact that it goes away (progressivle, I presume?) as you increase the f stop indicates it’s not in the focal plane (where the sensor is).
I’m more familiar with compact digital cameras, but these have a focussing lens which sits just in front of the sensor and is moved forwards or backwards in order to focus. This might be in the right position to cause the spot.
