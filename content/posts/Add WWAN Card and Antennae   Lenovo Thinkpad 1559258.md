Revamp Your Lenovo Thinkpad: Boost Your Internet Speeds With These Simple Steps - Add WWAN Card and Antennae Now!

If you're using a Lenovo Thinkpad, you're probably already aware of how powerful and efficient this device can be. However, there's always room for improvement, especially when it comes to your internet speeds. Luckily, there are a few simple steps you can take to revamp your Lenovo Thinkpad and boost your internet speeds almost instantly. In this article, we'll show you how to do it easily and quickly.

Step 1: Check Compatibility

Before you start, you need to make sure that your Lenovo Thinkpad is compatible with a WWAN card and antennae. You can do this by checking the specifications online or by contacting Lenovo customer support. Generally, most Thinkpad models released after 2010 are compatible with WWAN cards and antennae.

Step 2: Purchase and Install the WWAN Card and Antennae

Once you've confirmed compatibility, the next step is to purchase a WWAN card and antennae. You can easily find these accessories online or at any reputable computer store. Once you have them, it's time to install them.

First, you need to switch off your Thinkpad and remove the battery. Then, remove the SIM card tray if your Thinkpad has one, insert the WWAN card into the slot and secure it in place using screws. Next, connect the antennae to the WWAN card and place them in the designated areas inside the Thinkpad. Once you've done this, reinsert the battery and SIM card tray (if applicable) and switch on your device.

Step 3: Configure WWAN Settings

Now that the WWAN card and antennae are installed, you need to configure the WWAN settings. To do this, navigate to "Network and Sharing Center" in the Control Panel and click on "Mobile Broadband". Follow the prompts to set up a new mobile broadband account, and once you've completed this step, you should see a new network connection available for use. You can use this network to surf the internet and download files, and you'll notice a significant improvement in your internet speeds.

Conclusion

Adding a WWAN card and antennae to your Lenovo Thinkpad is a simple and effective way to boost your internet speeds. These accessories allow you to connect to the internet via cellular networks, which can be faster and more reliable than traditional Wi-Fi connections. By following these simple steps, you can easily revamp your Lenovo Thinkpad and enjoy faster internet speeds in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 I have recently purchased a Lenovo T490 second hand. The machine is amazing, but one of the reasons I was drawn to this machine was that some models have cellular connectivity. After looking into my machine there is no WWAN card or antennas on board. The MB has a sim slot, but again there is no WWAN card or antennas in the machine, but there is a slot for a WWAN card. I saw on your website where you have a video on how to replace WWAN antennas in a Lenovo T470, but I didn’t see anything on the T490. I know this will be pretty involved and was hoping you all had a how-to on adding a WWAN card, but more importantly how to install and route the newly purchased antennas. Thanks

 You haven’t stated exactly which model of T490 you have.  If you go to the Lenovo website and enter your serial number, or let it detect it, you should get more details.
Lenovo page for T490:     https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/nz/en/produ...

On this site it seems to imply that the WLAN & WWAN antenna is the same:    https://www.laptopparts.com.au/lenovo-th...

 Lenovo publishes their service manuals anyway, you just need to find the manuals and parts.
Not sure if this is your T490, but have a look to have some idea what they publish anyway.
