Title: You Won't Believe How One Charger is Sabotaging Laptops - See The Shocking Evidence on the Iview Megatron II!

Introduction:
Laptop chargers are a vital accessory to keep our laptops powered up throughout the day. It's reliable and works great, right? Well, not always. There's a new product on the market called the Iview Megatron II, and it claims to be a great charger with more features than any other. However, recent evidence suggests that it's actually sabotaging laptops with a dangerous power surge. Let's dive into the details.

Body:
The Iview Megatron II is advertised as a universal charger that can power up to 13 different models of laptops, including HP, Dell, Lenovo, and ASUS. But why is it being called out for its safety? Well, it all comes down to a power surge that has been reported when using this charger. Some users have complained that after using the Iview Megatron II, their laptops have been overheating, shutting down abruptly, or even causing permanent damage to their laptops' motherboard.

Further investigation shows that the issue with the Iview Megatron II is caused by the voltage it delivers. While most chargers provide a safe voltage range, the Iview Megatron II provides a higher voltage than required, leading to a power surge that can take a toll on the laptop's internal components.

This dangerous power surge can be the last straw for your laptop that leaves it unusable. The overload of voltage can cause permanent damage to your device's motherboard resulting in a dead laptop. Users who have experienced this issue have stated that the repair cost for their devices was higher than purchasing a new one.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Iview Megatron II charger is a danger to laptops due to its power surge. It is recommended that users opt for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) or reputable brands for charging their laptops to ensure safety and longevity. Let's not gamble with our laptops with this new product. Let's go back to basics and go for brands that we can trust for our safety and the longevity of our devices.


## Chosen Solution
 My laptop charger was acting up so i bought a universal one. However when I plugged it into my laptop, my laptop shut off completely and won’t come on. It was fully charged before I plugged in the new charger. I have an Iview megatron 2

 The iView Megatron is one of those no name laptops, so finding parts will be hard to find for this if it’s a hardware issue.
What brand of charger did you get, and did you check the polarity and voltage against the original? Center negative is rare these days, but you sometimes still see it despite the majority of laptops being center positive. Usually if it’s 1-2V off on a quality system, it can usually be safely suppressed by preventing power to run past standby or designed to not damage the computer, or they make it hard to use the incorrect one. A lot of these “entry level school laptops” aren’t designed with as much tolerance against this then say, Dell or Lenovo builds in. If the tip voltage is off by more than 1-2V, then you probably fried the motherboard.
If that isn’t it, these things have a tendency to randomly die for no reason and it may not be your fault. Depending on the warranty status, they usually aren’t worth repairing if it’s out of warranty or iView is strict about warranty validation in regards to the POP. Your money is better spent on a midrange consumer grade system (preferably i5 minimum CPU) if the machine has a hardware issue and you cannot find parts at a reasonable price.
