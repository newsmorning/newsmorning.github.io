Title: You Won't Believe How This Secret Code Can Unlock Your Washing Machine's Hidden Door!

Introduction

Have you ever wondered what lies behind the washing machine's hidden door? If you have, you're not alone. Many people have tried to open that door inquisitively but have left it unanswered. What could it be that the manufacturers are trying to hide from us? Well, the truth is, it isn't something the manufacturers are hiding from us. It's just a lock that keeps the door secure during washing. But did you know that there's a secret code that can unlock it? In this article, we'll show you how.

Method

The first thing you'll need to know is the exact model of your washing machine. Once you have that, you can look up the manufacturer's code for your specific model. The code is generally a combination of two or three buttons that need to be pushed in a certain sequence.

For example, for some models, you might need to press the "Temperature" button followed by "Spin Speed" and then "Start." For other models, it might be "Delay Start," "Pause," and "End of Cycle." It all depends on your model, so it's best to look it up before attempting.

Once you know the code, the process is quite simple. Turn on your washing machine as you normally would and wait for it to finish its first cycle. When the cycle is complete, press the appropriate buttons in the correct sequence. You should hear a clicking sound, indicating that the door is unlocked.

Safety Precautions

Before attempting to unlock the door, please make sure that the washing machine has finished its cycle and has completely stopped spinning. Do not attempt to force the door as this may cause damage to the machine or cause injury to yourself.

Conclusion

So, there you have it, folks. The secret code to unlocking your washing machine's hidden door. While it might not be as exciting as some people might have thought, it's still a nifty trick that will come in handy when you need to clean or repair your washing machine.

Always remember to follow the safety precautions when attempting to unlock the door. If you're unsure about anything, don't hesitate to contact the manufacturer for assistance. With this newfound knowledge, you'll be able to impress your friends and family with your washing machine secrets. Happy washing!

## Chosen Solution
 Samsung model wf45k6500av/a2 DC3 code.
How does the machine sense if the door is closed/locked? Is there a prox switch or is it measuring psi on the latch?
Is there a specific schematic for that part? Thanks

 Hi @onecrappieday
The service manual doesn't show a schematic for the door switch per se but it does show that there is a door lock switch LG part # DC34-00025D and also a door switch as well LG part # DC64-00828G
