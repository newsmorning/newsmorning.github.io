title: The Unfortunate Consequence of Choosing to Factory Reset My Blu Life 8 Phone

Have you ever accidentally chosen to factory reset your phone? It can be a terrifying experience, especially if you have important data, photos, and contacts on your device. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way what happens when you choose the wrong option on your phone's recovery menu.

One day, I was trying to troubleshoot some issues with my Blu Life 8 phone. It was running slow, some apps weren't working correctly, and I was constantly running out of storage. I had read online that performing a factory reset could fix these issues, so I decided to give it a try.

I went to my phone's recovery menu by pressing the power button and volume down button simultaneously. I selected the "Factory reset" option, assuming it would erase only the settings and data files. However, much to my dismay, it erased everything on my phone, including all my photos, videos, music, apps, and contacts. I felt like I had made a huge mistake.

Why did this happen? After doing some research, I discovered that the "Factory reset" option erases all the data on the phone's internal storage, including the operating system and apps. Essentially, it brings the phone back to its original state, just like when it was first bought from the store.

However, there was a more specific option called "Wipe data," which deletes only the user data, such as the apps, media files, and personal settings. This is the option I should have chosen, but I didn't know about it at the time.

The aftermath of my decision was painful. I lost all my important files, including photos of my family, friends, and travels that I had accumulated over the years. I had to start fresh, reinstalling all my apps and setting up my phone from scratch. I also had to accept that I would never see those pictures again.

In conclusion, the factory reset option can be a helpful tool in fixing phone issues, but it should be used with caution. Always make sure to read the instructions carefully and choose the right option that suits your needs. Moreover, it's essential to back up your data regularly to avoid losing your valuable files like I did. Don't make the same mistake; learn from my experience and take the necessary precautions.

## Chosen Solution
 How do I recover files & photos phone after factory reset?

 You can but it would cost you thousands of dollars in advanced data recovery. Unless your phone was backed up to a google account your photos are gone without paying out big money

 Hello
In settings  "back up and restore data"....is where you would go and
It should restore almost all of your info... but you would have to
have turned on the " back up my
data" feature...if you did, set your
phone up like in the beginning and
Go to settings, touch "back up my
data" and It should.
However, if you never set it up
this is not an option. You will have
to start over...this time don't forget to turn on your "back up
my data" feature.
Also if you have a memory card in
now...check on your memory card.
Hope you get it all worked out!

 Assuming you were using Google Photos app, and you did turned on the 'backup and sync' feature for this app, you can simply go to https://photos.google.com and your photos would be there.
Alternatively, if you had an SD card in the phone, and were storing photos, a reset would not have wiped the photos there.  You would have immediately seen those using the Google Photos app.
If neither of these were done, unfortunately, it isn't possible without thousands of dollars of forensic recovery tools to get back your photos.
