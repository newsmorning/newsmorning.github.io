If you are a retro gamer, you probably own a Nintendo Game Watch Screen, and if you are like me, you have a Super Mario game on it. Over time, the screen of these old devices can get damaged or start to fade, making it hard to play the game you loved so much. But fear not, because I have discovered an incredible screen fix for your Nintendo Game Watch.

This fix brings new life to your classic Super Mario game and allows you to unleash your inner Super Mario once again. All you need is a few items and some patience.

First, you will need a small screwdriver to remove the back cover of the Game Watch. Once you remove the cover, you will need to clean the contacts on the board and the inside of the cover with a soft cloth. This will remove any dust or dirt that may have accumulated over the years.

Next, you will need to remove the LCD screen from the board. To do this, unscrew the four screws holding the screen in place and gently lift it away from the board.

Now, you will need a bottle of distilled water and a cotton swab. Dip the cotton swab in the distilled water and use it to clean the contacts on the back of the LCD screen. Be gentle and take your time, as these contacts are delicate and can be easily damaged.

Once you have cleaned the LCD contacts, apply a small amount of conductive paint to the contacts on the LCD and board. This paint is designed to restore conductivity to the contacts and can be found online or at electronic stores.

Let the conductive paint dry for a few hours, and then reassemble the Game Watch. Put the LCD screen back in place and screw it back in.

Finally, power on your Game Watch and watch as the Super Mario game comes to life once again! The colors will be brighter, and the characters will be more vibrant than before.

In conclusion, if you want to unleash your inner Super Mario and enjoy your classic Nintendo Game Watch once again, this screen fix is a must-try. It's easy and affordable, and you will be amazed at the difference it makes. So, dust off those old Game Watches, and get fixing! Your nostalgic gaming experience will never be the same again.
