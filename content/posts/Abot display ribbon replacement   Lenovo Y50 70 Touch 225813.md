Unveiling the Secret to Fixing Your Lenovo Y50 70 Touch Display - Find Out How to Replace Your Display Ribbon Now!

Do you have a Lenovo Y50 70 with a touch display that is not working properly? If so, you may need to replace your display ribbon. The display ribbon is a small, flexible cable that connects your touch display to the motherboard of your laptop. When this cable becomes damaged, your touch display may stop working altogether.

Fortunately, replacing your Lenovo Y50 70 display ribbon is not as difficult as you may think. With just a few tools and a bit of patience, you can fix your touch display and get back to using your laptop like normal. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to replace your display ribbon.

Step 1: Gather Your Tools

Before you begin, you will need a few tools to complete this task. You will need a screwdriver set, a prying tool or a credit card, and a replacement display ribbon. You can purchase a replacement display ribbon from your local electronics store or online.

Step 2: Remove the Bottom Cover

To access the inside of your laptop, you will need to remove the bottom cover. To do this, remove all of the screws on the bottom of your laptop with your screwdriver set. Once you have removed all of the screws, use a prying tool or a credit card to gently pry off the bottom cover.

Step 3: Disconnect the Battery

Before you begin working inside your laptop, it is always a good idea to disconnect the battery. To do this, simply locate the battery connector and gently unplug it from the motherboard.

Step 4: Remove the Display Assembly

Next, you will need to remove the display assembly. To do this, remove the screws that hold the display assembly in place. Once you have removed the screws, gently lift the display assembly up and away from the laptop.

Step 5: Disconnect the Display Ribbon

With the display assembly removed, you will now be able to access the display ribbon. To disconnect the display ribbon, simply locate the connection point and gently unplug it from the motherboard.

Step 6: Install the New Display Ribbon

Once you have removed the old display ribbon, you can install the new one. Simply plug the new display ribbon into the same connection point as the old one.

Step 7: Reassemble Your Laptop

Now that you have installed the new display ribbon, it is time to reassemble your laptop. Simply follow the above steps in reverse order, and your laptop should be back to normal in no time.

In conclusion, replacing your Lenovo Y50 70 display ribbon is a relatively simple task that can be done with just a few tools and a bit of patience. By following the above steps, you can fix your touch display and get back to using your laptop like normal. So, if you are experiencing display issues with your Lenovo Y50 70, don't hesitate to try replacing the display ribbon.
