Title: The Shocking Truth: New Semi Charged Battery for iPhone 6S Fails to Charge When Depleted!

Introduction:

With the advancements in technology, smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. The battery life of these devices determines their usability and efficiency. However, users of the iPhone 6S are facing a new problem with the latest semi-charged battery. The battery fails to charge when depleted, leaving users frustrated and without a solution.

Body:

The iPhone 6S is a popular device among iPhone users due to its sleek design, high-end specifications, and features. The device comes with a powerful Lithium-ion battery that provides up to 14 hours of talk time, 10 days of standby time, and more. However, the battery life of the device has been a concern for years, and Apple has been continuously working to improve the battery technology.

Recently, Apple launched a semi-charged battery for the iPhone 6S in an attempt to improve the battery performance. The new battery was designed to offer a longer lifespan, better performance, and faster charging. However, users have reported facing issues with the battery when it gets depleted.

The iPhone 6S battery fails to charge when it reaches 0%. The device does not respond to any charging methods, including the standard Lightning cable, wireless charging, and even the fast-charging method. Users have complained that the device remains unresponsive and shows no sign of charging. This issue has left users with no option but to replace the battery, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.

The cause of this issue is not clear, and Apple has not provided any official statement addressing the matter. However, some experts believe that the problem is due to the battery management system of the iPhone 6S. The system fails to recognize the semi-charged battery when it is depleted and does not initiate the charging process.

Conclusion:

The semi-charged battery for iPhone 6S was designed to offer improved battery performance. However, users are facing new issues with the battery failing to charge when depleted. This problem has left users frustrated and without a solution. Apple needs to address this issue and provide a solution to its customers. Until then, users must be aware of the potential problem and be prepared to replace the battery if necessary. It is essential to have a reliable battery to ensure that your device performs efficiently and meets your daily needs.

## Chosen Solution
 Symptoms include:
1.  a brand new battery discharging like crazy. 50%>0% in like 2 hours while idling at the lock screen after boot, with all connectivity turned off except mobile data. while the screen is asleep.
2.  unusual and somewhat alarming heat build up somewhere under the shield closest to the display connectors. top or bottom side, i am unsure. but not hot enough to trigger the temperature warning.
the phone is still capable of charging a battery when a semi-charged battery is installed. and it does so, seemingly without issue. however, when you let it die, it DIES. it displayed the dead battery symbol for maybe 30 seconds and then it never came back on its own. connecting it to a charger does not bring it back to life at that point. the phone wont detect the cable. its almost like theres not even a battery in it.
i have tried:
1.  new batteries
2.  new charge ports
3.  attempted to get a power reading with this little charge port tester thing that i have. it shows 5.13V and 0.08A, but i got the same reading on another iphone i know works properly. not sure if my tester is just a piece of garbage or what.
any idea what i might be dealing with? it just seems like theres something bad on the board causing the battery to drain like crazy. im not really all that knowledgeable about board level repairs.

 This is a common issue in the iPhone 6S. If I am not mistaken the Tristar IC is faulty/ damaged. It can be fixed/ replaced by a repair centre that can perform board level repairs. I work at a repair centre and get quite a few iPhone 6S devices in a month with this problem and I have it repaired at a board level repair centre and it fixes the problem.
Check in your area for a repair centre that can perform board repairs and this should sort out your problem.
