# You Won't Believe How Easy it is to Replace Your 2017 Kia Niro Headlights - DIY Repair Guide Inside!

The Kia Niro is a popular SUV that offers excellent fuel efficiency and a spacious interior. However, maintaining your vehicle's headlights is a crucial aspect of ensuring your safety on the road. If your Niro's headlights have started to dim or flicker, it's time to replace them.

Fortunately, replacing the headlights on your 2017 Kia Niro is a simple process that you can do on your own. In this article, we'll cover everything you need to know to replace your headlights easily.

## Tools and Materials Required

Before you start replacing your headlights, you'll need to gather the following tools and materials:

- New headlight bulbs (type H11)
- A clean cloth
- Latex gloves
- Screwdriver
- Pliers

## Steps to Replace Your Headlights

Once you have the tools and materials ready, follow the step-by-step instructions below to replace your headlights:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Vehicle

Turn off your car's engine and open the hood to access the headlamps. Place the cloth over your headlamp assembly to protect it from any scratches or dirt while you're working. 

### Step 2: Remove the Old Headlight Bulb

Press the clip on the electrical connector, detach it from the bulb and take out the rubber seal. Rotate the base of the bulb 45 degrees counterclockwise, and then pull it out. Handle the old bulb carefully.

### Step 3: Install the New Headlight Bulb

Get a new bulb and insert it into the socket. Ensure that it is secured into position by locking it back by rotating it 45 degrees clockwise. Re-attach the electrical connector and the rubber seal.

### Step 4: Test the New Headlight Bulb

Once you've installed the new bulb, turn on your headlights to ensure that they're working correctly. Check both headlights to ensure that the new bulb and the old one deliver the same brightness and intensity.

### Step 5: Properly Dispose of the Old Bulb

Be sure to properly discard the old bulb in a container. There are facilities that take care of bulbs that are no longer used in vehicles.

### Conclusion

Replacing the headlights on your 2017 Kia Niro is a quick and easy process that can be achieved at home by following these easy steps. With a new set of headlights, you'll have improved visibility while driving at night, enhancing your safety and giving you peace of mind.
