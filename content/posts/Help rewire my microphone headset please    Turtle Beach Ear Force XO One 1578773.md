# Revolutionize Your Gaming Experience with One Simple Trick: How to Rewire Your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Headset!

Are you tired of your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Headset not working properly? Do you want to improve your gaming experience without having to buy a new headset? Look no further than this simple trick that will revolutionize the way you use your headset.

First, let's dive into the problem with the Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Headset. Many users have reported issues with voice chat and game audio not being balanced. This can lead to frustration and ultimately a less enjoyable gaming experience. The good news is that there is a simple solution that can fix these problems.

The trick is to rewire your headset using a mixer. A mixer is a device that controls the balance between game audio and voice chat. By adding a mixer to your setup, you can control the volume of each audio source independently. This means you can hear your game audio loud and clear without it overpowering your voice chat.

To rewire your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Headset, you will need a few things. First, you will need a mixer. One popular option is the Astro MixAmp Pro TR, which is designed specifically for gaming. You will also need a few cables to connect everything together. Finally, you will need a basic understanding of how to set up your audio settings on your console or PC.

The first step is to connect your headset to the mixer. You will need to use a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable to connect the headset to the mixer's headphone jack. Next, you will need to connect the mixer to your console or PC using an optical cable or USB cable. This will allow you to control the audio from your console or PC through the mixer.

Once everything is connected, you will need to adjust your audio settings on your console or PC. This will vary depending on your device, but generally, you will need to set your audio output to the mixer rather than the headset directly. This ensures that all audio is going through the mixer and allows you to control it.

With everything set up, you can now adjust the balance between game audio and voice chat using the mixer. This is usually done by adjusting the knobs on the mixer. You can find the right balance that works for you by testing it out while playing your favorite game.

In conclusion, rewiring your Turtle Beach Ear Force XO One Headset is a simple trick that can revolutionize your gaming experience. By using a mixer, you can control the balance between game audio and voice chat, ensuring that you never miss another important audio cue. Not only does this improve the overall quality of your gaming experience, but it also saves you from having to buy a new headset. Try it out today and see the difference for yourself!

## Chosen Solution
 My cats chewed through my $70 gaming headset. There are three wires (they all look copper). One is covered in thin green wire, one in blue, and one in red. There is white insulation. How do I rewire? Do I connect all the copper wires underneath the color wires and then connect the colored wires separately?

 Connect the colour to the one that has the same colour
If no colour is there its a guessing game dry fit first
THIS MAY SHORT AND BREAK IT
