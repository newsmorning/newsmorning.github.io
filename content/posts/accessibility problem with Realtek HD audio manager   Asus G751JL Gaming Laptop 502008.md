Introduction

Laptops are among the most essential gadgets in today's fast-paced world. For gaming enthusiasts, gaming laptops such as Asus G751Jl are the perfect tool for immersing into various games, enjoying the action and keeping up with the latest developments in the gaming world. However, despite its awe-inspiring features, the Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop is plagued with an accessibility problem that may surprise you. In this article, we delve deep into the issue and explain how it affects users and why Asus needs to address it.

What is the Accessibility Problem with the Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop?

The Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop comes with a unique keyboard design that features a numeric keyboard on the right side of the keyboard. It also includes a trackpad that sits slightly to the left of center. While this might look like a cool design, it poses a considerable problem for left-handed users.

The majority of users are right-handed, but left-handed users need laptops that cater to their needs as well. Unfortunately, the Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop's design forces left-handed users to use their right hand to navigate the trackpad, which can be challenging and frustrating.

Why is the Accessibility Problem with the Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop a Big Deal?

Asus is renowned for manufacturing high-performance gadgets that cater to a broad market. However, the accessibility problem with the Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop limits the usability of the product for a significant number of users, including left-handed individuals, people with disabilities or injuries to their right hand, and those who simply prefer using their left hand.

Such users might be forced to seek alternative brands or pricey customization, which is a lot of work and money for just a simple design flaw. For a company that aims to cater to different types of users, Asus should be making their products both innovative and accessible to cater to everyone's needs.

What Can Asus Do to Address the Accessibility Problem?

Asus can take several steps to eliminate the accessibility problem plaguing the Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop. First, they can create G751Jl Gaming Laptop models compatible with left-handed users by shifting the trackpad to the right side of the keyboard.

They can also make the numeric keyboard on the left-hand side, which will make the laptop more accessible to left-handed users. Asus can invest in research and development to come up with more inclusive design approaches that suit all types of users.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Asus G751Jl Gaming Laptop is an incredible product loved by many gaming enthusiasts. Despite its exquisite design and renowned features, the product suffers from an accessibility problem that limits its usability for a significant number of users. As such, Asus should work towards creating products that are inclusive and accessible for everyone, regardless of their preferences. With this approach, Asus would solidify its position as one of the leading global brands and win the loyalty of a broader market.


## Chosen Solution
 Hi all, I've not needed to use the mic input on my Asus before because I normally use a Blue Snowball mic which plugs into a USB port. I was hoping to record from a line level output from an old cassette player, but when I plug a cable from its headphone socket to the Asus mic input, it pops up the Realtek HD audio manager. I am blind and nothing in that window, except for the window title, is accessible with my screen reader. I use NVDA, if that is of any relevance.
Does anybody have any ideas of how I can bypass needing to use this Realtek audio manager, or have any suggestions for alternatives that might be more accessibkle? My only sighted assistance would be from my parents, who are not the most tech-savvy people.
Grateful for any suggestions,

 Hi,
Try this.  I am assuming you are tech savvy and know your way around the computer very well.
1) go to Control Panel, Programs
2) Uninstall the Realtek HD Audio Manager completely.
3) Go to http://www.realtek.co.tw, and find a link that says "HD Audio Codec Driver" on the main page, and click it.  It should go to the appropriate driver page.
4) Find the link for your operating system, there  should be one that is "Driver Only".  Download and install it.
5) Hopefully this is successful.  Now you can go to Control Panel, and then click on "Sound".  You can then choose your default recording device from here.
Good Luck.
