As an Acura TSX owner, you know the importance of breathing fresh air while driving. However, achieving that perfect breath of air can often be an elusive task. Fortunately, here are some pro tips that will help you maximize your air filtration system and breathe fresh air like a pro.

**Change Your Cabin Air Filter Regularly**

The first step to breathing fresh air in your Acura TSX is to regularly change your cabin air filter. This filter is responsible for preventing dirt, dust, and other pollutants from entering your vehicle's cabin. Over time, these contaminants can build up and clog your filter, reducing its effectiveness.

Most Acura TSX models come equipped with a cabin air filter that should be replaced at least once a year. However, if you frequently drive in dusty or polluted areas, you may need to replace it more frequently. To determine whether it's time to change your filter, check your owner's manual or consult with your trusted auto care technician.

**Keep Your Windows Closed When Driving**

Another pro tip to breathe fresh air in your Acura TSX is to keep your windows closed while driving. This may seem counterintuitive, but it's necessary to maximize your vehicle's air filtration system's effectiveness. When you drive with your windows open, you're allowing pollutants to enter your vehicle's cabin, undoing the hard work of your cabin air filter.

Of course, it's important to keep in mind that fresh air is essential for your health and well-being. Therefore, it's still recommended that you roll your windows down when parked or stopped at red lights to keep the air circulating.

**Use Your Air Conditioning System Regularly**

Finally, make sure to use your Acura TSX's air conditioning system regularly. Not only will it keep you cool and comfortable during the hot summer months, but it will also help filter out any contaminants inside your vehicle's cabin.

When using your air conditioning system, make sure to set it to the "recirculation" mode. This mode will close the outside air intake vent and recirculate the air inside your vehicle's cabin, increasing your air filtration system's effectiveness. Additionally, if you notice any strange smells or odors coming from your air conditioning system, have it checked out by an auto care technician as soon as possible.

In conclusion, breathing fresh air in your Acura TSX is essential for your health and comfort while driving. By following these pro tips, you can maximize your air filtration system's effectiveness and experience the benefits of fresh air like a pro.

## Introduction
 
Cabin air filters are made of multi-fiber materials, including paper cotton, that help prevent dirt, pollen, dust, bacteria, insects, and even bigger things like leaves from entering your car. It is recommended that for every 15,000-30,000 miles, the air cabin filter should be replaced with a new one. Replacing an old filter with a new one will improve driving comfort and the efficiency of the HVAC system, which falls under air conditioning and defrosting. Replacing the cabin air filter requires no tools and is easy to complete in a short amount of time.
