From these sites, it’s easy to download APK files to install any android app you want for free.\n5 Best Safe APK Download Sites for Android Apps APK stands for Android Package Kit, and is used for the distribution of Google Android applications. They’re saved in a .ZIP file format and are usually downloadable directly into the Android device.\nThere are plenty of options out there for APK sites but not all of them are safe and trustworthy. A little bit of research, which we’ve done for you, has nabbed us 5 different safe APK sites we suggest for APK downloading.\nAPKMirror APKMirror is not only a safe APK site but is also one of the most popular. This site has practically every app’s APK you’d look for and is constantly adding new releases. Every APK on the site is completely free and safe for download.\nThe selection is rather large on APKMirror and as a consequence, the categorization is kind of a mess. We’d suggest you use the search function to find a specific app instead of sifting through the endless categories to find what you’re looking for.\nYou could also check out the list of most popular APKs to get started. The site has millions of views and downloads daily, is easy to use and navigate, and ensures that you have the most up to date APKs available.\nAPK4Fun APK4Fun is just as robust and easy to use as APKMirror, but happens to be much more organized. This makes it easier to find your choice of APK in a faster, hassle-free way. The categories are labeled in a simpler manner such as Action, Puzzle, Racing, Social, etc. They also have a top downloads category similar to APKMirror’s popular downloads.\nAPK4Fun allows you to enjoy the best of its services, locating your most desired and safest APK files.

The homepage has a wide range of options from which to discover your desired apps. Updates are provided every day as noted in the every-day update on the site.\nRegion-locked apps are no longer an issue with APK Pure. Americans who enjoy Japanese RPGs on their Android devices will have no problem acquiring them here. The download and installation processes are incredibly smooth. Even more so than the Google Play Store.\nAPK Pure allows you to pre-register for future app installation. This means any new app you’ve got your eye on can be instantly downloaded to your device once it’s released. You can also enable APK Pure notifications so that you’re always apprised of available updates.\nAndroid-APK To locate those hard to get, no longer in development apps, Android APK is the place to go. The site will help you discover older app APKs that are both safe and functional. This is on top of also providing plenty of trending and newly released apps.\nThe database of safe APK downloads is quite impressive, with some of their most popular downloads being VidMate, YouTube video downloader, Pokemon TV, and more. The download process is quick and painless and, as previously stated, it’s a completely safe APK site. Be sure to check out their amazing collection of APKs, especially if you can’t find the one you’re searching for on any other site.\nBlackMart Alpha BlackMart Alpha doesn’t require Google account access nor any kind of site registration to access its vast library of APKs. It’s a great, safe alternative to the Google Play Store for any Android operating device.\nBlackMart Alpha’s interface is very similar to that of the Google Play Store. The biggest difference is that everything you see is free. The black market offers several features and applications for download on a very simple to use platform.
