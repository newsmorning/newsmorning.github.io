With its large 10.1-inch screen and powerful processor, it’s perfect for streaming movies, playing games, browsing the web, and even getting some work done. But have you ever thought of using your Galaxy Tab A 10.1 as a canvas for your creativity?\nThe tablet’s screen is like a blank canvas, just waiting for you to light it up with your artistic creations. Whether you’re a professional artist or just looking for a fun and creative way to pass the time, your Galaxy Tab A 10.1 can be the perfect tool for unleashing your inner artist.\nSo how can you make the most of your tablet’s screen and turn it into a digital art studio? Here are some tips to get you started.\nGet a stylus The first thing you’ll want to do if you’re serious about using your Galaxy Tab A 10.1 as a drawing tablet is to invest in a good stylus. A stylus will give you much greater precision and control than using your finger, and there are a variety of options available to choose from.\nThe Samsung S Pen is an excellent choice, as it’s specifically designed for use with Samsung devices, including the Galaxy Tab A 10.1. It’s pressure-sensitive, so you can vary the thickness of your lines by how hard you press, and it even has an eraser on the other end for correcting mistakes.\nDownload a drawing app Once you have a stylus, you’ll want to download a drawing app to use on your tablet. There are many free and paid options available, and which one you choose will depend on your personal preferences and needs.\nSome popular drawing apps for Android devices include Autodesk SketchBook, Adobe Photoshop Sketch, and Procreate. These apps offer a wide variety of brushes, tools, and effects to create stunning digital art.\nPractice, practice, practice As with any skill, the more you practice, the better you’ll get. Take some time to experiment with different brushes and techniques in your drawing app, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Digital art is very forgiving, as you can always undo or erase anything you don’t like.\nThe more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll become using your tablet as a canvas, and the more confident you’ll be in your artistic abilities.\nIn conclusion, if you’re looking to unleash your inner artist and make the most of your Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1, there’s no better way than to turn its screen into a blank canvas for your creativity. With a good stylus, a drawing app, and some practice, you’ll be amazed at what you can create. So let’s light it up and start creating!\nChosen Solution My Samsung Galaxy tab a 10.1 (sm-t580) has a black screen but the LCD is lit up along with the back lights, it happens after I went though TSA and hasn’t worked since. I don’t want to lose all my data so doing a factory reset is not a option.\nI did some research to see if it was possible that any X-Rays could damage your electronics going through TSA, but even in my own experience if they were known to cause damage to your phone or tablet I am very sure TSA or others would tell us. But here is what MakeUseOf said in an article: “X-rays are a type of ionizing radiation, which means that the photons have enough energy to knock electrons out of the atoms they come into contact with, creating positively charged ions in the process. In large doses, ionizing radiation can harm biological tissue by damaging cell DNA faster than it can be repaired. But electronics aren’t made of biological tissue and they don’t have any DNA to worry about. So can X-rays cause them damage? Not in any significant way, no.” So no damage from X-Rays if that is what you are worried about. I did some further research and found an older question back in 2016 of October about a similar problem related to your question Why Samsung galaxy tab a 10.1 2016 goes black some time Solution on that question may help you here, if you want here is also a link to troubleshoot the device.
