## Canva
 
Canva is a popular all-inclusive browser-based design tool that enables users to design anything and publish it anywhere.
 
It has an easy-to-use drag-and-drop user interface and provides a choice of many design templates. 
 
Search for a template or browse by category. What makes Canva unique is the vast database of image types you can design.
 
Canva allows users to create charts, images, and even infographics without requiring any design knowledge. 
 
Choose from a vast database of templates based on precisely what you need, including:

Since this article is about creating infographics, below are some of the templates offered.    
 
Select a template you want to edit, customize it with the elements in the library or upload your own, and then download your completed project.
 
Start from scratch and use the pre-made elements from the Canva database or upload your own.
 
When you are finished, export your infographic in multiple formats. You can also share it from the editor.
 
As part of Canva’s free plan, you have an option to purchase premium images, templates, and icons if you want a more customized look.
 
They also have a pro version for $9.95 per month. However, there is so much you can get for free with Canva, the paid option may not be worth the price. 
 
## Visme
 
Visme is a tool that lets you tell visual stories in many forms, including ad banners, social media graphics, interactive presentations, charts and graphs, and infographics.
 
The templates are easily customizable. Edit the text, change images, and put your data into graphs and charts.
 
Use Visme to build engaging visual presentations of your data quickly by dragging and dropping premade assets into place.
 
Take Visme for a test drive for free. Features included with the free version are: 
 
- 100 MB of storageLimited templates and some charts and widgetsUp to 5 projectsThe ability to download project as a JPG

 
If you want more templates, more elements, and the ability to create more than 5 Infographics projects, the premium plan is very affordable at only $16 a month.
 
## Snappa
 
Snappa is a drag and drop design tool aimed at non-designers. It also offers preset templates and a free infographic maker.
 
Choose a template, modify the text, shapes, and graphics, or start from scratch to create your own. Select the elements you want to include in your infographic from free, high-resolution images and graphics in the Snappa database.
 
Snappa is free for one user. What makes this tool different from many others is that users can download three designs per month.
 
Some of the other platforms only allow a few downloads in total (not monthly), meaning you will need to upgrade to continue using the tool. 
 
For those who don’t need to create more than three Infographics per month, Snappa can be free forever.
 
## Infogram
 
With an emphasis on data and numbers, Infogram is a design tool to help you create simple infographics from complex sets of data. 
 
You can also create Facebook posts, reports, slides, maps, and charts.
 
The basic plan is free and lets you get started to get an idea of how the tool works. 
 
Included are 37+ interactive charts, up to 10 projects, 13 map types, up to 5 pages per project, object animations, and the ability to import data.
 
However, the free plan only lets you embed the infographic on your website (with the Infogram watermark) and share the link on social media. To download an image or PDF, you must upgrade.
 
If this limitation doesn’t bother you, go ahead and sign up for a free Infogram account and try it out.
 
## Easelly
 
Visualize any kind of information with Easelly. The tool is easy to use. However, the free version only has a limited number of templates. 
 
Users have access to a database of elements such as connector lines, shapes, and arrows. Customize your text with different font types, sizes and colors. 
 
Or, upload your own graphics and put them in any position you want.
 
Click on a template or start from a blank canvas. Edit, change or customize any objects on the canvas.
 
If you love Easelly, the good news is that the upgrade is probably the most reasonably priced premium infographic tool at $5 per month, billed annually at $60.
 
Designing professional-looking infographics has never been easier with the many free tools available. 
 
Even if you are not a graphic designer, try out some of the above tools and create professional-looking infographics.
