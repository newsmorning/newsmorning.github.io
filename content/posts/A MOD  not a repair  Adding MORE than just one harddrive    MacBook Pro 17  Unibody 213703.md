You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Upgrade Your MacBook Pro 17 Unibody with This Simple Mod - Add Multiple Hard Drives Hassle-Free!

The MacBook Pro 17 Unibody is known for its impressive features, including high storage capacity, speed, and reliability. However, as technology advances, the need for more storage space becomes crucial, especially for professionals who use their MacBook Pro for work.

Adding an external hard drive is one option, but it comes with the added hassle of carrying an extra device and dealing with cables. The good news is that you can easily upgrade your MacBook Pro 17 Unibody internally by adding multiple hard drives with this simple mod.

Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Purchase a hard drive caddy

A hard drive caddy is a bracket that allows you to install an additional hard drive in your MacBook Pro. You can find a hard drive caddy online or at your local computer store. Make sure to choose the right size for your MacBook Pro 17 Unibody.

Step 2: Open your MacBook Pro

To install the hard drive caddy, you need to open your MacBook Pro. Follow these steps:

1. Turn off your MacBook Pro and unplug it from the power source.

2. Remove the screws at the bottom of your MacBook Pro using a precision screwdriver.

3. Carefully remove the bottom cover.

4. Remove the optical drive (CD/DVD drive) from your MacBook Pro. You can do this by unscrewing the bracket holding it in place and gently pulling it out.

Step 3: Install the hard drive caddy

Place the hard drive caddy in the slot where you removed the optical drive. Make sure to screw it in place, so it doesn't move around.

Step 4: Install the hard drives

Now it's time to install the hard drives. You can use the existing hard drive in your MacBook Pro or purchase new ones. You need to:

1. Connect the hard drives to the hard drive caddy using the provided cables.

2. Place the hard drives in the caddy and screw it in place.

Step 5: Reassemble your MacBook Pro

Once you have installed the hard drives, put everything back together. You can now enjoy the benefits of having multiple hard drives in your MacBook Pro.

Benefits of adding multiple hard drives to your MacBook Pro

1. More storage space: With more hard drives, you can store more files, documents, and media without worrying about running out of space.

2. Faster performance: By separating your files and applications on different hard drives, you can improve your MacBook Pro's performance, as it can access data faster.

3. Backup options: You can use one hard drive as your primary storage and the other as a backup. This way, you can store a copy of your important data in case of a hard drive failure.

In conclusion, upgrading your MacBook Pro 17 Unibody with multiple hard drives is easy and hassle-free, and it can greatly improve your productivity and performance. Don't hesitate to try it out and enjoy the benefits of having more storage space and faster access to your files and applications.

## Chosen Solution
 I already replaced the internal DVD drive with a harddisk.
But he space is there, why not removing the internal 7hours battery and place some extra USB2.0 Harddrives INSIDE the Macbook Pro and hook them to the USB ports?
(There is only 2 internal sata ports in a Macbook Pro)  Now, it sems that the Macbook does not only need the battery for keeping some preferences like date and time , but also uses it´s addiotional power when doing cpu-intensive tasks. Mine can be down to 90% when doing rendering for one night. So I guess a smaller battry must be used while making up space for two harddrives in the battery compartment. Using 4 750gb disks, it could be about 3TB in a Macbook pro.
So here are my questions:
-What are the exact voltages of (I guess there are several) of the battery?
-Does anyone know the pinout of the 10-pins battery connector?
-Does the system measure only the voltage of a battery when loading, or also the amperes?
- The USB-cables of the extra harddisks should be soldered to the USB-connectors on the logic board.
This is only possible with very thin wires or a flexible flat cable. Do USB specifications allow such cables, probaly ushielded? (Distance will be around 15-20mm.
Thank you, all the best, Herbert
Update
Hello to all,
thanks for the answers!
Well, first of all: Working as a film-editor, you NEED storage. The footage of my recent documentary uses almost 3TB.
About powering the drives: The footagl is already on three 1TB, usb powered harddisks. The mac´s usb-bus has no problem in powering them.
Two buses would be "lost", woth the mod there is still one left for adding an USB.hub externally, for printers, burners etc.
But the big problem lithium-ion polymer battery: It´s cells need to be carefully balanced during charge by the mac´s echarging circuitry, so putting in a smaller type to make room for the hd´s seems to be a no-go.
All the best, Herbert

 I would be using a Mac Pro if I were you. Especially being a Film Editor. You would gain so much more by using the Mac Pro's more powerful CPUs and ability to have the space you need. If you really have to have the MBP, I would get the Pegasus R6 Thunderbolt enclosure. I have the 6TB version in Raid 5 (5TB useable space) and it works beautifully. Super fast transfers. I'm a working DJ and have almost 3TB of music on there. Plus Ableton projects eat up a lot of space too. Don't Eff up your machine on some crazy idea of 3TB of internal storage on a MBP. Quite frankly, that would fall into the "insane" category.

 i would consider one of these

i know some people that run personal web servers off of these machines so i think this should meet your needs.
