How do I go to recovery mode on iPhone?
iPhone 5s - iPhone 8+ :
Step 1. Hold Power button and Home button together until apple logo appears, when apple logo appears release power button but keep holding Home button, you will see iTunes logo or computer logo—This will work even if your Home button is not working.
iPhone X onward :
Click the Power button for 20 — 30 seconds until computer logo appears.
After your iPhone is in recovery mode go to iTunes on your computer and click on Restore and Update and then click on Restore, this will get your iPhone to factory settings and all data will be lost but your iPhone home button will start working.
