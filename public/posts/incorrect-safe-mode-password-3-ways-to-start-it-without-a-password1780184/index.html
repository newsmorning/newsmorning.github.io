Forgetting your Safe Mode password can be frustrating, especially if it means not being able to access your computer. However, there is no need to panic! There are several simple hacks that you can use to get back into your Safe Mode without any hassle.\nHack 1: Reset Your Password Using Command Prompt One of the easiest ways to reset your Safe Mode password is by using Command Prompt. Here’s what you need to do:\nRestart your computer and press the F8 key until the Advanced Boot Options screen appears.\nUse the arrow keys to select the Safe Mode with Command Prompt option and press Enter.\nWhen the Command Prompt window appears, type “net user [username] *,” where [username] is the name of the account you want to reset the password for.\nYou’ll be prompted to enter a new password. Type the new password and press Enter. You’ll need to confirm the password by retyping it.\nClose the Command Prompt window and restart your computer.\nYou should now be able to log in to your Safe Mode using the new password.\nHack 2: Use a Password Reset Disk If you created a password reset disk before forgetting your Safe Mode password, you’re in luck! Here’s how to use it:\nInsert the password reset disk into your computer and restart it.\nWhen the password dialog box appears, click on “Reset Password.”\nFollow the on-screen instructions to reset your Safe Mode password.\nIf you don’t have a password reset disk, you can still create one using the “Create Password Reset Disk” option in the Control Panel.\nHack 3: Boot from a Windows Installation Disk If you don’t have a password reset disk and the Command Prompt method doesn’t work, you can use a Windows installation disk to reset your Safe Mode password. Here’s how:\nInsert the Windows installation disk into your computer and restart it.\nWhen the “Press any key to boot from CD or DVD” prompt appears, press any key.\nSelect your language and other preferences and click “Next.”\nClick on “Repair your computer” and then select “Troubleshoot.”\nClick on “Advanced options” and then select “Command Prompt.”\nFollow the same steps as in Hack 1 to reset your Safe Mode password.\nClose the Command Prompt window, remove the installation disk and restart your computer.\nConclusion\nForgetting your Safe Mode password can be a frustrating experience, but there’s no need to panic. By following these simple hacks, you can reset your password and regain access to your computer without any hassle. If all else fails, you can always seek help from a professional to regain access to your computer.\nWindows Safe Mode was always a way out of software-related issues. Uninstalling applications in the Safe Mode is much easier than in the standard system state.\nTested and proven solution to regain access to your PC is Safe Mode If the Windows 10 Safe Mode password is incorrect, a problem is caused by a password bug.\nThe Safe Mode password is not working, but you can also use the Safe Mode with Networking option.\nThe password can also be easily removed by using a bootable drive.\nDownload Restoro PC Repair Tool that comes with Patented Technologies (patent available here).\nClick Start Scan to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems.\nClick Repair All to fix issues affecting your computer’s security and performance\nRestoro has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.\nUnfortunately, some users weren’t able to access Safe Mode due to a password bug. Even though they typed in the password (the correct one, we hope), they could not log into the system.\nWe offer solutions for this problem below, just like we did for the PC automatically starting in Safe Mode. So, feel free to try them out and tell us whether they addressed the problem.\nWhy is my Safe Mode password incorrect? Some of the reasons Windows 10 is stuck in Safe Mode with an incorrect password can be your mistake or device issues.\nBelow are some of these causes:\nEntering PIN instead of the password: Most users confuse their PIN for the password. When the Safe Mode with Command Prompt or the usual Safe Mode requires a password, you need to enter your password, not the 4-digit PIN. This should give you access to your PC. Issues with your PC: You might be entering the correct password at times, but some hard-to-trace problems might prevent you from logging in. In this case, you might need to reinstall Windows 10. How can I fix the incorrect Safe Mode password? We advise trying the troubleshooting steps below to see if they fix this issue before proceeding to the solutions in this section:\nEnter your password and not your PIN. Try different iterations of your old passwords if the present one is not working. If all of these are not working, you can now proceed to the fixes below:\n1. Use Safe mode with Networking Press and hold the Shift key, click the Power icon and choose the Restart option. When your PC restarts, choose Troubleshoot \u003e Advanced Options. Select Startup settings. Now, click the Restart button. Finally, choose the Enable Safe Mode with Networking option from the list. Booting into the Safe Mode with Networking is a must if you’re using a Microsoft domain account on your administrative Windows 10 account.\nThe standard boot might work without an internet connection, but this doesn’t apply to the Safe mode due to a bug. So this might be why you’re incorrectly dealing with the Safe Mode password.\nSome PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.\nExpert tip:\nSPONSORED\nWith that in mind, we suggest rebooting your PC again and trying Safe mode with Networking this time.\n2. Use a Windows 10 bootable drive to remove the password Download the Media Creation Tool. Plug in the USB stick in the fastest port. It needs to have at least 8 GB of free storage space (Have in mind that the procedure will delete everything from the USB flash drive, so backup your data timely). Select the Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC option and click Next. Choose Language and Architecture. Click Next. Choose the USB flash drive option. Please wait until the tool downloads the file and mounts them onto the USB. Boot with the bootable installation drive and choose Repair from the left corner. Choose Troubleshoot \u003e Advanced options. Now, choose Command Prompt. In the command line, type the following command and press Enter: C: bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot or bcdedit /deletevalue safeboot Remember to replace C in the command above with the letter of the drive where your system is installed. Now, exit Command Prompt and restart your PC. This workaround proved to be the solution for the incorrect Safe Mode password issue. But, to do it, you’ll need to acquire the bootable installation media. Nevertheless, you should be able to do it by following the steps above.\n3. Clean install Windows 10 Finally, if you can’t boot Windows 10 in a standard manner and the Safe Mode password is still a no-go, we suggest reinstalling Windows 10, following the steps in the linked guide.\nHow to Fix A Specified Logon Session Does not Exist [3 Ways] Fix: Credential Manager Not Working / Not Saving Passwords A Problem Has Been Detected And Windows Shutdown: Fix Fix: You Must Enable System Protection on This Drive The article contains a detailed explanation of what is needed and the various ways to do it.
