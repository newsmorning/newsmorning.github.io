If you're a Honda owner or considering purchasing one, you'll want to read this shocking story of a 1994-1997 Honda Accord with Cel Code 15 that starts but dies IMMEDIATELY!

According to an owner on a Honda enthusiast forum, their trusty 1997 Honda Accord had been starting perfectly every time until one day, it started and died immediately. They attempted to start it multiple times, but it would not stay running.

The owner went to the mechanic, and after running diagnostics, they discovered that the car was experiencing the dreaded Cel Code 15. The code pertains to a problem with the fuel injector circuit, which can cause issues with starting, idling, and acceleration.

After some research, the owner found that this was a common issue with 1994-1997 Honda Accords and could even lead to a dangerous situation if the car died while driving. However, the issue is not limited to the mentioned models, so other Honda owners should also take this seriously.

The owner attempted to fix the issue themselves by replacing the fuel injector, but unfortunately, the problem persisted. The repair costs were starting to add up, and the car was still not driveable.

Finally, the owner took it to another mechanic who suggested checking the main relay. After replacing the main relay, which was a costly option in itself, the car was finally back up and running.

The takeaway from this story is that Honda owners should be aware of the possibility of Cel Code 15 and make sure to check their main relay, which could save them a lot of time and money in the long run. Additionally, Honda should address this issue, as it is a safety concern that could lead to accidents.

In summary, if you own a 1994-1997 Honda Accord or any other Honda model, be cautious if you experience any starting problems and consider checking the main relay before replacing costly parts. As always, make sure to follow proper maintenance procedures to avoid other potential issues.


## Chosen Solution
 I have a 1995 Honda Accord LX 2.2L that dies immediately as I crank it. Everytime it stalls, I have to turn the car off to get it to start again. The check engine light revealed a code 15, which is ignition. I replaced the ignition coil, wires, distributor cap, rotor button, and the ICM, or igniter. The car seemed to get better and I even drove it around for 45 minutes straight. But once I came to drive it again, it stalled on me in the middle of the road. I've heard main relay might cause the same problems, but why would it throw an ignition code? I thought maybe the whole distributor might be bad. The car has over 250xxx miles on it and the distributor could be stock. Is there anything else that could cause the cel 15 code to pop up? Please help. I've basically been throwing parts at it. This is my first Honda and I'm not familiar with their common issues.

 A bad relay could be the cause but check these things first.
Check that all connections at distributor and all wires are good condition
When it shuts off and throws a code 15, check to see that you have battery voltage at the yellow wire by using your negative battery terminal as your ground, key needs to be in ON position, if no voltage check for open wire or bad connection, if you have battery voltage there check the other connection at the distributor using the same procedure as before, you should have 10 volts there.
