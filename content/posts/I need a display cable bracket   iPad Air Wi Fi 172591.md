## Chosen Solution
 I am repairing an iPad Air 1st Gen and have found that a previous repair shop did not replace the display cable bracket shown in step 37 for this guide:
iPad Air Wi-Fi Front Panel Assembly Replacement
I have spent several weeks on the internet trying to find the price with now luck. I've lost 8 bids on eBay auctions trying to get an iPad for-parts. At this point, I'm looking to manufacture a facsimile of the part out of a small aluminum plate. Before I do that, I thought I would ask this community.

 I believe that bracket really is only there to keep the cable in place. If you are having trouble finding the part honestly I would either look for the same generation iPad in not working condition on ebay or another auction site or just drill small holed in any small piece of metal to save some money.
