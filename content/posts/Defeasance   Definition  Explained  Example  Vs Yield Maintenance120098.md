I. Defeasance
Defeasance is a process by which a borrower can obtain the release of their property from the mortgage while avoiding prepayment penalties. It involves replacing the collateral of the original loan with another form of collateral (usually a portfolio of US Treasuries) that has a similar cash flow profile to the original loan. 

1.1 Definition and Purpose
Defeasance is a legal process that allows a borrower to avoid prepayment penalties when they want to sell or refinance their property. The purpose of defeasance is to substitute collateral that is at least as valuable and has a similar cash flow profile as the original loan. This ensures that the lender's position is not compromised by the prepayment.

1.2 How it works
To initiate a defeasance, the borrower must first identify a portfolio of US Treasuries that, when combined with the remaining payments of the original loan, produces cash flows that closely match the original loan. The borrower then transfers the portfolio of US Treasuries to a defeasance trustee, who takes custody of the collateral and uses it to make the remaining payments on the original loan. 

1.3 Advantages of Defeasance
The main advantage of defeasance is that it allows a borrower to avoid prepayment penalties, which can be substantial. Defeasance also enables the borrower to sell or refinance their property without having to renegotiate the interest rate or other terms of their mortgage. 

1.4 Disadvantages of Defeasance
The main disadvantage of defeasance is that it can be costly. The borrower must pay for the portfolio of US Treasuries, as well as for the services of a defeasance trustee. These costs can be significant, especially for smaller loans. Additionally, the process can take several weeks, which can be a disadvantage if the borrower needs to close on a sale or refinance quickly.

II. Yield Maintenance
Yield Maintenance is a prepayment premium that compensates a lender for the lost interest that would have been collected if the loan had not been prepaid. Yield Maintenance may be either full-term, which extends for the entire life of the loan, or partial-term, which extends for a specified period of time.

2.1 Definition and Purpose
Yield Maintenance is a form of prepayment penalty that compensates a lender for the lost profits resulting from a borrower's early payment of a loan. The purpose of Yield Maintenance is to provide the lender with a measure of security against changes in interest rates.

2.2 How it works
Yield Maintenance essentially requires the borrower to make a payment equal to the present value of the remaining interest payments on the loan, discounted at the then-current Treasury rate. The lender uses this payment to buy a corresponding interest rate swap or Treasury portfolio to replace the lost interest from the loan's prepayment

2.3 Advantages of Yield Maintenance
The main advantage of Yield Maintenance is that it allows lenders to recover lost profits resulting from prepayment. This helps to mitigate the risks associated with lending funds in the first place. 

2.4 Disadvantages of Yield Maintenance
The main disadvantage of Yield Maintenance is that it can be costly to the borrower. The prepayment premium is often calculated as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance, which can add up to many thousands of dollars. Additionally, Yield Maintenance can limit borrowers' flexibility in refinancing or selling their property, as they may need to wait for the prepayment period to expire.

III. Comparison between Defeasance and Yield Maintenance
When deciding between Defeasance and Yield Maintenance, it's important to consider the cost of each option, as well as the flexibility provided to the borrower.

3.1 Cost Comparison
Defeasance can be more expensive than Yield Maintenance, as it requires the borrower to purchase a portfolio of US Treasuries in addition to paying for the services of a defeasance trustee. Yield Maintenance is typically calculated as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance, and may be more or less expensive than Defeasance depending on the terms of the loan.

3.2 Flexibility Comparison
Defeasance provides borrowers with a greater degree of flexibility than Yield Maintenance, as it allows them to sell or refinance their property without having to wait for the prepayment period to expire. Yield Maintenance can limit borrowers' flexibility, as they may need to wait until the prepayment period has ended before refinancing or selling their property.

3.3 Impact on Investment Decisions
Understanding the differences between Defeasance and Yield Maintenance can have a significant impact on a borrower's investment decisions. For example, if a borrower is planning to sell their property in the near future, Defeasance may be a better option, as it provides greater flexibility. If, on the other hand, the borrower plans to hold the loan for the full term, Yield Maintenance may be the more cost-effective choice.

IV. Conclusion
Understanding the differences between Defeasance and Yield Maintenance can save commercial real estate investors thousands of dollars in prepayment penalties. By comparing the costs and flexibility of these two options, borrowers can make more informed investment decisions that can help them maximize their returns. To make the best decision, borrowers should consult with their legal and financial advisors to understand the specific terms and conditions of their loan.

It is common in real estate and widely used in other financial transactions. The borrower has to ensure that submitted securities adequately equate to the cash flow generated from the entire loan; this includes both the principal and interest. Substituting property with bonds is a complex and time-consuming process, but in the end, it benefits both parties.

Key Takeaways

 
- Defeasance is when a borrower substitutes mortgage collateral by submitting sufficient funds and bonds. Borrowers substitute assets when they wish to pay off loans early or to sell the mortgaged property.Defeasance bonds are usually US treasury bills. Lenders prefer US bonds because they are backed by the US government and are considered risk-free.For lenders, real estate defeasance is a steady income stream as it replaces the collateral with a portfolio of US bonds.Most mortgage transactions include a defeasance clause. The clause states: once all the payments and legal terms are satisfied, the property title is transferred from the lender to the borrower.

 
### How Does Defeasance Work?
 
Defeasance, at its core, is simply a form of prepayment. It is a mortgage arrangement between a lender and a borrower; a little complex but beneficial to both parties in the long run. 
 
The borrower submits new collateral to a lender. This collateral comprises a portfolio of securities—treasury bonds, treasury bills, and treasury notes. This collateral (securities) becomes a regular income stream for the lender. In return, the lender removes the lien from the collateral (land or property). Typically, lenders prefer US bonds—they are backed by the US government—considered risk-free.
 
The defeasance definition points out a provision—a borrower can free up land or property by exchanging it with bonds and securities. Once the securities portfolio is submitted, the property is free; it is no longer stuck as collateral. Defeasance should not be confused with similar provisions like yield maintenance, where borrowers make actual payments to release collateralized property.
 
Typically, lenders are not eager to close loan obligations too soon—they will lose earnings from the interest that way. But in many day-to-day scenarios, borrowers need to use the collateralized property. For example, if a borrower wants to sell a property that is submitted as collateral, they can apply for defeasance. Once the property is released, they can sell it immediately. Also, the loan interest is a liability for the borrower, closing early could be a suitable option.
 
The borrower must ensure that securities and liquid cash, balance the collateral adequately. Also, the process involves multiple clauses, obligations, and fees. The fee is expensive. Some lenders accept other securities as well (non-US bonds). 
 
For all future transactions, the real estate market refers to the transfer of ownership title. The title is released to the borrower when they clear all liabilities and legal terms.
 
### Example
 
Let us look at a defeasance example to understand the application of this arrangement.
 
Caleb is a mortgage lender. He works alone and deals in real estate. Paul is a potential client—he wants to purchase a house. Paul borrows a home loan from Caleb. Therefore, the loan agreement mentions Caleb as the lender, and Paul as the borrower. Both parties sign the terms and conditions.
 
Within a few months, Paul visits Caleb and requests him to accept a repayment—in the form of securities, and bonds. Caleb agrees to the request. Once the formalities are completed Paul has complete ownership of the property. Meanwhile, Caleb receives regular premiums from the portfolio of bonds.
 
The income from the securities is equivalent to the profit generated from the original collateral. Further, Paul is free to sell his house. Most borrowers close mortgages for the purpose of selling the property.
 
### Defeasance vs Yield Maintenance vs Prepayment
 
Now, let us look at defeasance vs yield maintenance vs prepayment comparisons to distinguish between the terms.
 
- Defeasance is only the substitute for the collateral, whereas yield maintenance is an actual payment. In contrast, prepayment is a penalty imposed on a borrower for repaying too soon (before the completion of loan tenure).When borrowers substitute bonds for property, they are required to pay a heft fee. In contrast, yield maintenance is a simple process with no hidden charge. Prepayment is a hefty penalty, discouraging more borrowers from repaying too early. The defeasance process takes 30 days or more. Yield maintenance is significantly quicker.Substituting bonds with property is a release process. In contrast, both yield maintenance and prepayment are pay-off processes.In the case of prepayment or yield maintenance, the loan terminates. In contrast, bond portfolios act as continuous repayments.Defeasance has a lockout period of 24 to 36 months. In contrast, prepayment and yield maintenance are available without lockout periods.

Most mortgage transactions include a clause. A mortgage agreement establishes a mortgagee and mortgagor. The defeasance clause states that once payments and legal formalities are completed, the property title or ownership will get transferred from the lender to the borrower. For all future transactions, the real estate market refers to this transfer of ownership title.
 
For lenders, real estate defeasance serves as a steady income stream as it replaces the collateral with a portfolio of US bonds. In contrast, the borrower is free to refinance or sell the property once it is released from collateralization. In doing so, the borrower is making money.
 
If a borrower tries to substitute mortgaged property with bonds, they have to undertake a complex and lengthy process. Thus, the borrower ends up paying legal fees, accounting expenses, consultation fees, title deed transfer fees, etc.
