# You won't believe what's causing the glitch on the HTC Droid DNA - is your phone affected?

If you're an HTC Droid DNA user, you may have noticed some glitches recently. The screen may flicker or freeze, the device may restart unexpectedly, and the battery may drain quickly. This issue has been bothering many users, and some have even reported that their phone has become unusable.

But what's causing the glitch? After conducting some research, we've found that the issue is related to the device's Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset. The chipset is responsible for processing data and controlling the device's performance. However, it seems that this particular chipset has a flaw that is causing the glitch on the Droid DNA.

The issue is related to how the chipset processes graphics. It appears that the graphics processing unit (GPU) in the Snapdragon S4 Pro is not compatible with the Droid DNA's display. This incompatibility causes the device to overload the GPU, which then leads to the glitches mentioned earlier.

But not all Droid DNA devices are affected. It seems that only those devices with a certain manufacturing date are experiencing the glitch. If your device was manufactured before September 2012, you may be affected.

The good news is that HTC has acknowledged the issue and is working on a solution. The company has released an update that aims to address the glitch, but not all users have reported a complete fix. Some users have reported that their devices still experience the issue despite the update.

If you're an HTC Droid DNA user and are experiencing the glitch, there is a workaround that may help. You can try disabling some of the phone's graphics-intensive features, such as live wallpapers or animations. This may alleviate the strain on the GPU and reduce the likelihood of glitches.

In conclusion, the glitch on the HTC Droid DNA is caused by an incompatibility between the device's display and the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset's GPU. The issue affects devices manufactured before September 2012. Although HTC has released a software update to address the issue, some users are still experiencing glitches. Until a complete fix is found, disabling graphics-intensive features may help alleviate the problem.
