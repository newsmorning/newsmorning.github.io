Is Your Home Button on the Fritz? Discover How the Blu Vivo 8 Could Revolutionize Your Phone Experience!

The home button on your phone is a small yet critical feature that many of us take for granted. It allows us to navigate our devices with ease and provides a sense of security knowing that we can quickly return to the main screen. However, when the home button is malfunctioning or broken, it can be incredibly frustrating and hinder our phone experience. Fortunately, the Blu Vivo 8 offers a solution to this problem while revolutionizing the way we use our phones.

The Blu Vivo 8 is a mid-range Android device with impressive features, including a 5.5-inch IPS display, 4GB RAM, and a MediaTek Helio P10 processor. However, what sets this phone apart is its innovative use of fingerprint recognition technology. Instead of a physical home button, the Vivo 8 has a touch-sensitive fingerprint scanner located on the back of the device. This new design not only eliminates the need for a physical button but also offers added security for users by requiring a fingerprint to access the device.

While the removal of the home button may seem like a minor change, it has a significant impact on the overall phone experience. Firstly, it creates a larger screen-to-body ratio, allowing for a more expansive display. The fingerprint scanner can also be used for other functions, such as taking photos, and adds an extra layer of convenience. The placement of the scanner on the back of the device is also ergonomically sound, making it easy to reach with your index finger.

Another notable feature of the Blu Vivo 8 is its camera capabilities. The device boasts a 13-megapixel front-facing camera and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, both with LED flash. The camera also includes a variety of features such as HDR, panorama, and face detection, making it a great choice for those who enjoy taking photos.

The device also includes quick charging capabilities, a large 4,010mAh battery, and a sleek metal body design. These features make the Vivo 8 not only visually appealing but also practical for daily use. Furthermore, the phone is unlocked, allowing for use on multiple carriers.

In conclusion, the Blu Vivo 8 presents an innovative solution to a common problem while providing impressive specs and features. The touch-sensitive fingerprint scanner located on the back of the device not only eliminates the need for a physical home button but also adds an extra layer of security. The camera capabilities, quick charging, and sleek design make it a solid choice for anyone in search of a mid-range device. So, if you find yourself struggling with a malfunctioning home button, take a look at the Blu Vivo 8 and experience the revolutionized phone experience it can offer.

## Chosen Solution
 So I went to sleep with my phone working normally and when I wake up the home button is not working. I restart the phone and no difference but then I realized that the fingerprint sensor is still working perfectly normal. So the button itself is responsive in that respect it's just not performing it's primary function which is to take me to the home screen. Anyone have any solutions?

 Is it possible that any liquid got into the phone? Some types of water corrosion can stop specific features from working. Based on the part I found, it looks like the replacement isn’t going to be worth it. You might be able to open the device to clean and reset the connection, although I cannot find a tear down to confirm how this phone is opened.
If you aren’t comfortable working on the phone with no guide, there are alternatives that will allow you to use the phone. iPhones have Assistive Touch which is a software feature to control buttons from the touch screen. Here is an app that you can install to get this feature on android.
Hope this helps!
