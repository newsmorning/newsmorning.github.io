# Say Goodbye to Annoying Blue Screen Errors - Here's the Ultimate Solution for KB4517389 BSOD!

Have you experienced the frustration of being in the middle of an important task on your computer when suddenly, a blue screen error pops up? It's an inconvenience that can disrupt your workflow, and worst of all, you might lose your progress.

One of the most recent blue screen errors that have been causing headaches for Windows 10 users is the KB4517389 BSOD. The issue arises from faulty updates, where the system hardware or software fails to work correctly due to the latest Windows update. Don't worry; we've got you covered. Here are some of the best solutions to help you say goodbye to annoying blue screen errors:


## Solution 1: Uninstall KB4517389 Update

The first thing you should do is to uninstall the KB4517389 update that is causing the blue screen error. You can do this by following the steps below:

- Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
- Choose "Update & Security."
- Click on "Windows Update" and select "Update history" under the "View your update history" section.
- Click on "Uninstall updates" in the top-right corner.
- Search for "KB4517389" and select it.
- Click on "Uninstall" and follow the prompts.

After uninstalling the update, restart your computer and see if the blue screen error persists.


## Solution 2: Run a System File Check

Another solution you can try is running a system file check to fix any corrupted files that may be causing the blue screen error. Here's how to do it:

- Press Windows key + X and select Command Prompt (Admin).
- Type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter.
- Wait for the process to finish.

If the scan detects and repairs any problems, restart your computer and check if the blue screen error persists.


## Solution 3: Run a Disk Check

Disk errors can also cause blue screen errors. Running a disk check can help you detect and fix any issues with your hard drive. Here's how to do it:

- Press Windows key + X and select Command Prompt (Admin).
- Type "chkdsk /f /r" and press Enter.
- Press Y to schedule a disk check for the next restart.
- Restart your computer.

Once the disk check job completes, reboot your computer and check if the blue screen error has been resolved.


## Solution 4: Upgrade Your Device Drivers

Another common cause of blue screen errors is outdated device drivers. You can upgrade your device drivers using the following steps:

- Press Windows key + X and select "Device Manager."
- Expand the driver category that needs an update.
- Right-click on the outdated driver and select "Update driver."
- Select the option to "Search automatically for updated driver software."
- Once the search is complete, download and install the new driver.

After updating your device drivers, restart your computer and check if the blue screen error persists.


## Solution 5: Seek Windows Support

If all else fails, it's time to seek Windows support to fix the blue screen error. You can contact the Microsoft support team through their website or by calling their contact number.

Don't let blue screen errors ruin your workday. Use these solutions above to say goodbye to the KB4517389 BSOD and enjoy uninterrupted productivity on your computer.
