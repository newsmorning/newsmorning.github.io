Rev Up Your Windows 10 PC Like a Pro - Killer Tips to Boost Your Speed and Performance!

Are you tired of your Windows 10 PC running slow and sluggish? Are you frustrated with the never-ending loading times and delays? Fortunately, there are a few simple and effective tips that can help you speed up and optimize your computer like a pro. In this article, we'll explore some of the best techniques to rev up your Windows 10 PC and keep it running at peak performance.

1. Uninstall Unwanted Programs and Apps:

One of the most common reasons for a slow-running PC is a cluttered hard drive with too many applications and programs. Over time, your computer accumulates unnecessary files and programs that consume your system resources and slow down your PC. To speed up your computer, you should start by uninstalling any unwanted and unused programs and apps. Simply go to "Control Panel" and select "Programs and Features" to remove any application or program that you don't use or need.

2. Disable Startup Programs:

Another reason why your Windows 10 PC may be running slow is because of too many programs that run at startup. Many programs and apps are set to run automatically when you start your computer, which can significantly slow down your boot time and overall performance. To disable these programs, simply do the following:

a) Press "Ctrl + Shift + Esc" to open the Task Manager.

b) Go to the "Startup" tab.

c) Disable any unnecessary programs by right-clicking and selecting "Disable."

3. Use a Solid-State Drive (SSD):

One of the best ways to boost the speed and performance of your Windows 10 PC is to use a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a traditional hard drive. SSDs are much faster and more reliable than traditional hard drives, making them an excellent choice for anyone looking to speed up their PC. While they can be expensive, they're worth the cost if you're looking for a significant upgrade in terms of speed and performance.

4. Adjust Visual Effects:

By default, Windows 10 comes with many visual effects that can consume a lot of system resources and slow down your computer's performance. These effects include animations, shadows, and transparency effects. If you want to speed up your PC, you should consider disabling these visual effects to free up some processing power. To do this, simply follow these steps:

a) Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties."

b) Click on "Advanced System Settings."

c) Click on the "Advanced" tab and then click "Settings" under "Performance."

d) Select "Adjust for best performance" and click "Apply."

5. Keep Your System up to Date:

Finally, make sure to keep your Windows 10 PC up to date with the latest updates and patches. These updates will help improve your system's stability, security, and overall performance. To check for updates, simply go to "Settings" then select "Update & Security." From there, click on "Check for updates" to ensure that you have the latest software installed on your PC.

In conclusion, these are just a few tips and tricks to help you speed up and optimize your Windows 10 PC. By uninstalling unwanted programs, disabling startup programs, using an SSD, adjusting visual effects, and keeping your system up to date, you should be able to significantly improve your computer's speed and performance. With a little effort and some adjustments, you can rev up your Windows 10 PC like a pro and enjoy a faster, more efficient computing experience.

Windows 10 and a multitude of third-party apps include system optimization tools. Those tools enable you to speed up Windows and fix system errors that might undermine the OS.
 
## Speed up booting time & declutter the drivers to boost performances.
 
- If you want to learn how to improve PC performance in Windows 10, you've come to the right place.
 - We compiled a list of the most efficient performance-boosting practices in Windows 10.
 - These include using PC boosters, updating drivers, running scans, and more.
 - Continue reading below if you're looking for a Windows 10 performance improvement for your slow PC.

 

 
- Download Restoro PC Repair Tool that comes with Patented Technologies (patent available here).
 - Click Start Scan to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems.
 - Click Repair All to fix issues affecting your computer's security and performance

 
- Restoro has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.

 
So to give your desktop or laptop a boost, you should make the most of the system tools in Windows and perhaps some included in additional third-party software, as well.
 
This is how you can improve PC performance in Windows 10, primarily with the platform’s own options and tools, but also with a few extra utility programs.
 
What can I do to speed up my Windows 10 computer? The first thing you should do is clear all the useless background processes. Usually, slow PC performance is caused by a lack of RAM.
 
If that doesn’t do the job, remove some startup items or speed up context menus. For more info on how to do that, check the guide below.
 
## How to improve computer performance on Windows 10?
 
### 1. Check the RAM usage and close the background processes
 
- Right-click the taskbar and select Task Manager.
 - To check RAM usage, select the Performance tab on the Task Manager window as shown below (that includes a Memory graph that shows you the amount of RAM in use).
 - Click the Processes tab. That shows your software open on the taskbar and background processes.
 - Select background processes there and press their End task button to close them (do not close the more essential processes listed under Windows processes).

 
RAM is perhaps the most crucial system resource. This is the amount of temporary storage a PC has for software.
 
- How to improve computer performance on Windows 10?
 - 1. Check the RAM usage and close the background processes
 - 3. Use a third-party software
 - 4. Remove the Startup items
 - 6. Speed up the Windows 10 Boot
 - 7. Adjust the Performance options
 - 8. Check for low disk space
 - 9. Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter
 - 10. Speed up context menus

 
All software needs at least a little RAM, and lots of open programs and background processes will overstretch system resources. For example, new Windows games are generally the most resource-hungry software.
 
And they will run slower when lots of other background programs and processes reduce the amount of free RAM that could otherwise be allocated for the game.
 
Running games with the highest graphical settings, which further depletes RAM, will also slow the gameplay down. Thus, there’s an obvious link between RAM and PC performance.
 
Consequently, it’s not surprising that some Windows optimization software includes RAM optimization that frees up RAM.
 
Although Windows 10 doesn’t include a RAM optimizer, you can still free up lots of RAM by manually closing software and background processes.
 
Don’t forget that disabling browser extensions, apps and plug-ins will also save some RAM.
 
### 3. Use a third-party software
 
It goes without saying that one of the best ways to improve performance in Windows 10 is to use a reliable third-party optimization tool.
 
### 2. Run the System File Checker
 
The System File Checker is a somewhat overlooked maintenance tool that can fix corrupt system files. Thus, it can fix various system errors.
 
You can use the System File Checker by typing cmd in the Windows search box and clicking on the Run as administrator option below the results.
 
Type in sfc /scannow and press Enter to launch the scanning, which might take a while.
 
While some of the optimizations themselves could be done manually, they require a certain degree of skill and experience to pull off, otherwise, you might end up damaging your PC instead of repairing it.
 
That being said, keep in mind that the best Windows 10 optimizer software comes with PC cleaning features, PC speed boosters, and integrated performance monitors.
 
On top of that, many of these tools allow you to create backups of your registries before fixing them, ensuring that no damage is done to your PC.
 
You can also use these utilities to manage your disks. They typically include disk defragmentation tools, as well as disk backup and restore options.
 
For an automatic check-up and optimization of your PC, we recommend Restoro, a software that specializes in Windows repair, registry optimization, restoring DLL files and more.
 
### 4. Remove the Startup items
 
- Open the Task Manager as before.
 - Now click the Start-up tab to open a list of your startup software as below. Note than in some earlier Windows platforms the startup manager is in MSConfig, which you can open by entering ‘msconfig’ into Run.
 - Select startup items and press their Disable buttons to remove them from the Windows startup.

 
You can further save RAM and speed up the Windows 10 startup by removing startup software. Those are programs that open automatically during the Windows startup.
 
###  Restoro 
 
  Enhance your system performance with a fast and reliable optimization tool.  
 
### 6. Speed up the Windows 10 Boot
 
### 5. Update the drives with third-party software
 
Antiquated drivers can slow down desktops and laptops, and some hardware devices might not work correctly without the most updated drivers.
 
True, Windows Update automatically updates the most essential drivers; but that doesn’t guarantee it will update all of them. As such, you can check and update drivers with the Device Manager in Windows.
 
However, there are also various third-party programs that identify and update outdated drivers.
 
DriverFix is an excellent utility that you can update your drivers more quickly. It has a database of over 18 million drivers so you can be sure that it will find yours.
 
Downloading and installing the tool is extremely simple. It will launch right after finishing the installation and it will perform a scan to look for any outdated drivers.
 
After just a few seconds, you will get a report with a list of recommended drivers to install. Then you can press an Update All button to update the antiquated drivers.
 
There is also the option of updating the drivers individually by checking their corresponding boxes and clicking on the Update button from their right.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.
 
Expert tip:

If Windows 10 is taking a while to fully boot up, you can speed it up to improve PC performance. You can boost the startup with the Turn on fast startup option and MSconfig tool included in Windows.
 
1. In the Windows search box type Control Panel and hit Enter.
 
2. Click on System.
 
3. Now select Power & sleep and click on Additional power settings.
 
4. Click Choose what the power buttons do on the left of the tab.
 
5. The System Settings tab includes a Turn on fast startup option. If that option is grayed out, select Change settings that are currently unavailable.
 
6. Click the Turn on fast startup checkbox to select that option.
 
7. Press the Save Changes button to apply the new setting.
 
8. Press the Win key + R keyboard shortcut and enter msconfig to access System Configuration.
 
9. Click the Boot tab to open the settings.
 
10. Select the No GUI boot option to remove the Windows welcome screen.
 
11. Press Apply and then click OK to save the settings.
 
12. Restart Windows to apply the new MSconfig settings.
 
### 7. Adjust the Performance options
 
- Press the Win key + R hotkey, tap in sysdm.cpl and click OK.
 - Now, click the Advanced tab on the System Properties window and press the Settings button.
 - The Visual Effects tab lists all the effects, which will probably be selected by default.
 - Selecting the Adjust for best performance option will deselect all the effect settings.
 - Finally, press the Apply and OK buttons to confirm the new settings.

 
Windows 10 also has a Performance Options window from which you can adjust the platform’s visual effects.
 
The snazzy effects might add a little extra gloss to Windows, but they also need extra system resources.
 
If your desktop or laptop has more limited RAM, maybe you should switch some effects off to speed it up a bit.
 
### 8. Check for low disk space
 
- Click the File Explorer button on the taskbar.
 - Then select This PC that shows you devices and drives and how much free HDD you have as below.
 - You can use a more detailed disk analyzer tool by adding CCleaner to Windows 10. Then open that software, click Tools, and select Disk Analyzer.
 - You can select to scan for more specific file categories to see what file formats are taking up the most HDD space. Alternatively, you could just select the Everything checkbox and press the Analyze button.
 - Click the Cleaner button at the top left of CCleaner to open its HDD cleaner tool.
 - You can select to scan for a variety of Windows and third-party software junk files by clicking their corresponding checkboxes. As such, CCleaner is much more flexible than the Disk Clean-up tool.
 - Press the Scan button to scan for items to delete. Then CCleaner will show you what it will erase and how much storage space will save.
 - Press the Run Cleaner button to erase the files.
 - Removing software is the best way to free up HDD space. Click Tools and select Uninstall.
 - You can select the software there and press the Uninstall button to remove programs.

 
Almost every PC optimization utility comes with a hard disk cleaner, and Windows also has its own Disk Clean-up tool to delete junk files with.
 
HDD cleaners are essential tools as overly full hard disks can slow things down. Virtual memory combines RAM and hard disk space, so a really full hard disk restricts the amount of virtual memory.
 
In addition, erasing junk files will also give you more space for software and your own documents, photos, MP3s, videos, etc.
 
The solution above shows you how you can check for low HDD space and erase junk files with CCleaner, which has better options than the Disk Clean-up tool.
 
### 9. Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter
 
- In the Windows search box type Control Panel.
 - Then click on System and Security and select Security and maintenance.
 - Click on Maintenance.
 - Click on Start maintenance with the windows defender shield icon next to it.
 - Wait for the process to finish.

 
The System Maintenance troubleshooter is another handy tool that can boost PC performance. This deletes unused shortcuts and files and fulfills other maintenance duties.

For example, when you run the tool, it can fix the troubleshooting history that’s taking up disk space.
 
### 10. Speed up context menus
 
- Open the Registry Editor by entering regedit into Run (Win key + R).
 - Navigate to this registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop
 - Double-click MenuShowDelay to open the Edit String window directly below.
 - Erase the default 400 value and enter something like 270.
 - Press the OK button to close the Edit String window.
 - You can close the Registry Editor, and right-click the Windows desktop to open the context menu a little quicker than before.

 
This is a basic registry tweak. By adjusting the MenuShowDelay string, you can minimize the delay before a context menu opens. By default, that string has a 400-millisecond delay.
 
Those are a few of the best ways to optimize Windows 10 for better PC performance.
 
There’s no essential requirement for extra third-party software, but freeware programs such as DriverFix and CCleaner certainly have better options for updating drivers and deleting junk files.
 
However, Windows 10 already has most of the more essential maintenance tools and options you’ll need.
 
Hope that these tips helped you speed up your Windows 10 PC and now you can enjoy a faster and better experience.
