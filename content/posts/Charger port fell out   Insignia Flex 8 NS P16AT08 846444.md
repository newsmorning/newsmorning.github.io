You won't believe what happened to my Insignia Flex 8 NS P16At08 charger port - this is a warning to all device owners!

As a proud owner of an Insignia Flex 8 NS P16At08 tablet, I relied heavily on it for entertainment and productivity. However, one day, I noticed that my device wasn't charging despite being connected to a charger. Upon inspection, I discovered that the charger port had been damaged beyond repair. I was shocked and dismayed as I had taken good care of my device and never abused it in any way. Little did I know that this was a common problem faced by many device owners, including those with similar models.

In my quest to find a solution, I did some research and discovered that charger port damage is a common problem across many devices due to several factors. Firstly, some chargers and cables are low-quality and prone to wear and tear, leading to damage or breakage of the port. Secondly, some device owners are unaware of the proper way to handle and connect chargers, leading to accidents that cause damages to the ports. Finally, some devices have design flaws that make their charger ports susceptible to damage.

While I wasn't aware of these factors when I first purchased my device, I now know better, and I am sharing my experience as a warning to all device owners. Here are some tips to help you prevent charger port damage and ensure that your device stays in top condition:

- Invest in high-quality chargers and cables that have good reviews and ratings from other users. Such cables are designed to handle wear and tear and reduce the risk of damage to your device's ports.
- Handle your chargers with care and avoid twisting or bending them, as this could cause damage to their wires or plugs, which in turn could damage your device's charger port.
- Always connect the charger to the port properly and avoid forcing or jiggling the plug when connecting it. Also, avoid charging your device when it's in a tight-fitting case, as this could cause strain on the port and damage it.
- If you notice that your device isn't charging properly or that the charger port has become loose or damaged, stop using the charger immediately and take it to a certified repair shop or contact your device's manufacturer for assistance.

In conclusion, charger port damage is a frustrating experience that could leave you without a fully functioning device. However, by following the tips outlined above, you can prevent such damage from occurring and also prolong the lifespan of your device. So, heed this warning and take good care of your device's charger port to enjoy smooth and uninterrupted usage.


## Chosen Solution
 The charger port fell out, & I'm trying to find out, who can fix it ,and how much.....it's brand new

 Latreas Ingram  if "it's brand new" then you do want to use your warranty (seller or manufacturer) to get this repaired. To have anybody else do it, you will have to do an online search for this type of repair in your geographic region. We generally do not recommend other repair service on here since that would not be objective.
If you want to repair it yourself, use this guide Insignia Flex 8 NS-P16AT08 Battery Replacement to get to it. The charging port is soldered onto the circuit board. So it could be as simple as re-soldering to as complex as replacing the complete board. If you post some images of what the damaged part and area looks like, we could guide you further. For that, use this guide Adding images to an existing question

 Better off just buying a NEW system. By the time you get done finding a motherboard and paying to get it shipped, you will have more in it then what we paid for it originally… I'm just gonna buy another one through Walmart…
