Introduction

The iPhone 7 Plus is a popular smartphone that is known for its advanced features such as Touch ID and 3D Touch. However, when the screen on this device is replaced for any reason, it can cause these features to stop working. In this article, we will explore what happens when you replace the screen on an iPhone 7 Plus and how to solve this problem.

The Problem

When the screen on your iPhone 7 Plus is replaced, it can cause the Touch ID and 3D Touch features to stop working. This is because the Touch ID sensor and 3D Touch module are uniquely paired to each device's logic board. When the screen is replaced, the Touch ID sensor and 3D Touch module are no longer correctly paired with the device, causing these features to stop working.

The Solution

If you have recently replaced the screen on your iPhone 7 Plus and have lost the Touch ID and 3D Touch features, don't worry. You can easily solve this problem by going through a few steps.

Step 1: Verify the Screen Replacement

First, you need to make sure that the screen replacement was done correctly. This is important because if the replacement was done inadequately, it could cause the Touch ID and 3D Touch features to malfunction. To confirm that the screen was replaced appropriately, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to settings
2. Tap on Touch ID & Passcode
3. Enter your passcode
4. Add a new fingerprint

If the device allows you to add a new fingerprint, then the Touch ID sensor is working fine. However, if the device does not accept your fingerprint data, it means that the Touch ID sensor has been damaged, and you may have to visit an authorized service provider or Apple Store to replace it.

Step 2: Check the 3D Touch Module

If the Touch ID sensor is working fine, then the problem might be with the 3D Touch module. To check whether the 3D Touch module is working correctly, follow these steps:

1. Download any 3D Touch-enabled app, such as Instagram or Snapchat
2. Try to use 3D Touch on the app icon

If the 3D Touch feature works on the app icon, it means the issue is not with the 3D Touch module, and the problem may lie elsewhere in the device.

Step 3: Reset the Device

If both the Touch ID sensor and the 3D Touch module are working fine, then the issue may be related to the software. To solve this problem, you can reset your device by going through the following steps:

1. Go to Settings
2. Tap on General
3. Scroll down to Reset
4. Tap on Erase All Content and Settings

After the reset, set up your iPhone 7 Plus as a new device and check if the features are working correctly.

Conclusion

In conclusion, replacing the screen on your iPhone 7 Plus can cause Touch ID and 3D Touch to stop working. However, by following the steps outlined in this article, you can quickly diagnose and solve these problems. Remember to ensure that the screen replacement was done correctly and then try resetting your device. If none of these steps works, you may have to consult an authorized service provider or visit an Apple Store for further assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 my I7+ was water damage(old one) so I bought a  used  I7+ (new one)for replace
because the new one had a crack on the  screen
so I change my old one's screen to the new one.
after change screen,  touch ID(which is old one's touch ID )  didn't work and my new one's system shows  touch ID   has issue and will not working
then I though it's because I forgot change touch ID  either, so I change  touch ID from old one to new one  (which is pair with the new one's CPU) but same thing  still happened.
there has any thing  i can do to get  my touch ID  back to work?

 Try with a new screen (could be defective) then you try with the old screen.. If not look for damages on the home button.
The button might be damaged and cannot be repaired without soldering.
Iphone 7 home buttons cannot be replaced
