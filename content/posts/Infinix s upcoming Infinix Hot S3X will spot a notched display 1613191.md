Hereâ€™s something I honestly donâ€™t get, why do people take Appleâ€™s way of doing smartphones as â€˜gospelâ€™? I mean, everyone from Huawei to OnePlus to ASUS and practically everyone in between is notching their displays. The annoying bit is, the amount of bezel that comes with the said phone defeats the purpose of having it in the first place.
 
That said, the notch-life is all the rage right now and Infinix is hopping onto the band-wagon. Infinixâ€™s been teasing an upcoming device that will apparently spot a notched display.

Not much is known about this device, save for the supposed name which suggests that it could be a restyled Infinix Hot S3, with slightly beefier internals, at least we hope so.
 
Pundits predict key improvements in the deviceâ€™s camera capabilities over the base model Infinix Hot S3, a bigger display, of course, performance, but all this is mere speculation at this stage. True to Infinixâ€™s portfolio, this device should be aimed squarely at the entry-level segment of the market. The entry-level Snapdragon 430 chipset solidifies this assumption.
 
A notched Infinix device. I suppose there is a certain level of appeal to that idea. A design cue otherwise reserved for the super expensive devices on a budget device. Reminds me of what happened to fingerprint sensors.
