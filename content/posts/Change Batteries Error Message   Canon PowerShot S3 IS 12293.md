Is Your Canon Powershot S3 IS Driving You Crazy with "Change Batteries" Error Message? Here's the Quick Fix!

Are you one of the Canon Powershot S3 IS users who are often bothered with the "change batteries" error message? If yes, then you are not alone. Many users have reported experiencing this error message time and again on their S3 IS model. However, the good news is that there is a quick fix for the problem. Here's what you need to know.

The Canon Powershot S3 IS is an advanced digital camera that comes with a high-resolution imaging sensor and advanced features for capturing stunning photographs and videos. However, like other electronic devices, the S3 IS also has its share of issues. One of the most common issues reported by S3 IS users is the "change batteries" error message that appears even when the batteries are new and fully charged.

So, what causes this error message to appear on your S3 IS camera? Well, the answer lies in the design of the battery compartment. The battery compartment of the S3 IS is designed to work with rechargeable AA batteries. However, the contacts inside the compartment are not very sturdy, and they tend to shift out of position when the camera is subjected to a mild jolt or shock. This can result in poor contact between the batteries and the camera, leading to the "change batteries" error message.

The quick fix for this issue is to clean the battery contacts inside the camera. You can use a clean, dry cloth or a cotton swab dipped in alcohol to clean the contacts. Make sure to clean both the contacts inside the battery compartment and on the battery terminal. Once you have cleaned the contacts, try inserting the batteries again and see if the error message still appears.

If cleaning the battery contacts does not solve the problem, you can try using a piece of aluminum foil to make the contacts more snug. Cut a small strip of aluminum foil and place it between the battery and the contact. This will help improve the contact and prevent the error message from appearing.

In conclusion, if your Canon Powershot S3 IS is bugging you with the "change batteries" error message, then you can try the quick fix mentioned above. However, if the problem persists, it may be time to consider changing the batteries, or even upgrading to a newer camera model. With a little bit of care and maintenance, you can ensure that your S3 IS camera continues to capture stunning photographs and videos for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I have an Canon powershot s3 is I keep getting a change batteries message and I have tried to resolve it using multiple forums answers. I have changed all batteries multiple times. Nothing. I have changed the 1220 date and time battery too and nothing. Nothing seems to work. The camera will only allow me to turn on the camera to adjust the date and time then it gives me a change battery error directly after. I even tried taking out batteries for about a week. Please help!!

 It might help to clean all the battery contacts, inside the camera too, with a Q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol (available at your local pharmacy).
