## Chosen Solution
 I have the original home button from a ipad Pro 10.5  which I need to fix onto the new screen, however not sure what needs adhesive tape applied to it.
I know the home button bracket needs tape applied to either side but do the following also need it?
Does the rubber gasket need tape applied to it to fix the white plastic ring?Does the plastic ring need tape fitted to it so it sticks to the glass?

 I put adhesive on the ring and usually the gasket around the home button will keep it in place.  Once the iPad is closed the space behind the home button keeps it in place unless there is some structural issues with the iPad or the gasket.
