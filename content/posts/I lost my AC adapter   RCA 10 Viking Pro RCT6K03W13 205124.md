Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Lost My AC Adapter for My RCA 10 Viking Pro RCT6K03W13 - The Solution Is Mind-Blowing!

Introduction:
Have you ever lost the AC adapter for one of your electronic devices? How frustrating is that experience and how do you deal with it? If you are a RCA 10 Viking Pro RCT6K03W13 tablet user, then you have come to the right place. I recently lost my AC adapter for this device, and I was worried about how to charge it again. However, I found a solution that blew my mind, and I cannot wait to share it with you.

Body:
The RCA 10 Viking Pro RCT6K03W13 comes with an AC adapter that outputs 5 volts DC and 2 amps. I searched online for a replacement AC adapter for this device, but I could not find an exact match. There were some adapters with similar output specifications, but I was not sure if they would work with my tablet or damage it. I did not want to take the risk of buying an incompatible adapter and regretting it.

Then I remembered that I had a power bank that I use to charge my smartphone. It has a USB output port that provides 5 volts DC and 2.1 amps, which is close enough to the output of the original AC adapter. I thought, "Why not try using the power bank to charge the tablet?"

So, I connected the power bank to the tablet using a USB to micro-USB cable, and voila! The tablet started charging. I was amazed that such a simple and commonly available device could solve my problem. I could use the power bank to charge the tablet anywhere, anytime, without worrying about finding a power outlet or an AC adapter.

Conclusion:
Losing an AC adapter can be a headache, especially if you cannot find a replacement easily. However, thinking outside the box and trying alternative solutions can save you time, money, and hassle. In my case, using a power bank to charge my RCA 10 Viking Pro RCT6K03W13 tablet proved to be a mind-blowing solution. I hope this article inspires you to be creative and resourceful when faced with similar situations. Remember, sometimes the simplest solution is the best one.


## Chosen Solution
 Does anybody know the specs of this tablet's AC adapter? Knowing the input and output would be great. Thanks

 Hi,
There are two ways that you can charge the tablet.
Either with an AC/DC adapter with an AC voltage and input plug design dependent on your location and having an output of 5V DC @ 2.0A and a DC barrel type output power plug (2.5mm).
The alternative is to connect the tablet via a USB cable to any known working computer's USB port or even connecting a mobile phone charger which has a micro USB connector attached.
Be aware that using the USB port charge option, charging will take longer as most computer USB ports or phone chargers only supply 5V DC at 0.5A.
Here's an image to show the two charging options for the tablet.
