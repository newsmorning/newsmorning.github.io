As technology continues to advance, more and more devices are being equipped with biometric scanning systems for added security. One of the most popular methods is through fingerprint scanning, which is widely used in laptops, smartphones, and even physical security systems. However, even the most advanced technology can experience technical difficulties, and the Dell XPS 13's fingerprint scanner is no exception. But don't worry! We have listed three life-saving hacks to fix your Dell XPS 13 fingerprint reader like a pro.

## Hack #1: Check the Hardware

The first step in fixing your Dell XPS 13 fingerprint reader is to check if the hardware is working properly. It is possible that the scanner has been damaged or has encountered a technical problem. To check if the hardware is functioning, go to Device Manager by pressing the Windows Key + X and then clicking on Device Manager. Under the ‘Biometric Devices’ option, locate the fingerprint reader and ensure that it’s enabled. If it’s not, right-click on it and choose ‘Enable Device.’ If the device is working properly, it will notify you that the drivers are up to date.

## Hack #2: Update the Fingerprint Reader Drivers

If the hardware is working correctly but the fingerprint reader is still not functioning, the next step is to update the drivers. The drivers for the fingerprint reader are installed separately, and updating them can help to solve the problem. You can update the drivers via the Dell official website or by running the Dell Support Center app on your laptop. Make sure you download and install the latest drivers that are compatible with your Dell XPS 13 model.

## Hack #3: Reset the Windows Biometric Service

If the first two hacks do not work, then resetting the Windows Biometric service may solve the problem. To do this, go to Services by pressing the Windows button + R and then typing ‘services.msc’ in the Run command box. Find the Windows Biometric Service, right-click on it, and choose ‘Restart.' After the service has been restarted, try using the fingerprint reader again. If this doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the biometric driver.

In conclusion, the Dell XPS 13 fingerprint reader is a useful and efficient security feature that has a lot to offer. However, its performance can be affected by various factors, such as hardware damage and outdated drivers. The hacks mentioned above will help you get your fingerprint reader working perfectly, like a pro! If you still encounter difficulties with the fingerprint scanner, don't hesitate to contact Dell's support team or seek the help of a professional technician.
