Introduction

If you’re an Apple user, you know how frustrating it can be when your MacBook stops working properly. When it comes to MacBook Pro 15, problems can be complicated sometimes. It can be slow, crash, or even become completely unresponsive. But before you head to the Apple store for a costly repair, there’s one simple fix that might save you a lot of time and money. In this article, we’ll share with you our experience with reviving a dead MacBook Pro 15 by giving it a little TLC with one simple fix.

The Issue we faced

Our MacBook Pro 15 was bought in 2017 and had been in use for almost 4 years. Despite the fact that we were taking great care of it, gradually it started to become slow and laggy. We started noticing that it was heating up a lot and frequently restarting, causing the battery to drain faster than usual. Checked the activity monitor to find out what's going on in the background, but found nothing unusual. It was quite frustrating for us, as we depended on it for work and couldn't afford to buy a new one.

The Solution we came up with

One day, while searching for a solution on the internet, we stumbled upon an article that suggested cleaning the dust from the inside of the MacBook. We realized that we had never done that before and decided to give it a try. Without any delay, we opened the lid and removed the back panel. We were shocked when we saw the amount of dust, hair, and debris that had accumulated inside. We removed it all using a soft brush and also washed the fans carefully. After, we closed everything and turned it back on.

The Results we got

After the cleaning, the MacBook was working like new again, and to our surprise, the battery life was extended double. We also noticed that the temperature had decreased significantly, and the MacBook was no longer heating up. We opened the activity monitor again and were amazed to see that the processes that used to be at 80-90% before were now at 10-20%. It was an unbelievable improvement. To test how much difference this cleaning made, we ran a temperature test before and after. Before cleaning, our MacBook was running at 85 Celsius (185 Fahrenheit), while after cleaning, it was only at 54 Celsius (129 Fahrenheit). That's a temperature drop of 31 Celsius or 56 Fahrenheit.

Conclusion

Cleaning the dust from the inside of the MacBook Pro 15 can determine the health of the MacBook. It's a simple and affordable way to boost the performance of your MacBook and extend its life. We would recommend anyone with a similar issue to try this simple fix before heading to the Apple Store for a costly repair. In conclusion, regular cleaning is critical for devices' maintenance and even more for ones sensitive to heat like MacBook Pros.

3. Changed fans speed to system control
4. Game freezed, Mac went into the bootloop
5. Shortly after it stopped, only fans were silently spinning
6. I checked all of the basic suggestions such as reset this and that, but black screen is still there with fans silentry spinning

 Disconnect the battery, then press the power button for 15 Sec’s to clear SMC. Now plug in the battery and restart your system but this time press the Shift (⇧) key to enter into Safe Mode which by passes the discreet GPU your system has. Did it boot up?
