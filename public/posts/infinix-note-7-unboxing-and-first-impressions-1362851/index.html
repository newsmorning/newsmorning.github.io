The phone has been making waves in the market for its amazing features and breathtaking design. As a writer, I had the opportunity to unbox the phone and experience its features firsthand. And to say the least, the experience was nothing short of amazing.\nCONTENTS OF THE BOX The Infinix Note 7 comes packed in a sleek, bright yellow box that immediately catches your attention. Opening the box reveals the following items:\nThe Infinix Note 7 phone A clear phone case A power adapter A charging cable A pair of earphones A warranty card A user manual THE DESIGN The Infinix Note 7 is not called a game-changer for nothing. From the moment you lay your eyes on the phone, you can tell that it’s something special. The phone boasts of a massive 6.95-inch display with a punch-hole design that houses the front camera. The phone’s front and back are made of glass, while the frame is made of plastic. The phone’s design is sleek and modern, making it a perfect fit for every user.\nApart from the punch-hole design, the phone’s back also features a circular module that houses the quad-camera setup, a flash, and the Infinix logo. The back of the Infinix Note 7 is as beautiful as it is functional. The phone has been designed for ergonomics, which makes it comfortable to hold for long periods.\nCAMERA The Infinix Note 7 features a quad-camera setup that comprises four cameras: a primary 48MP sensor, a 2MP macro lens, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP dedicated video camera. The front-facing camera is a 16MP sensor that delivers great selfies. The camera app comes with plenty of features and modes that enhance the user experience.\nThe Infinix Note 7’s camera is exceptional, and it delivers great pictures, even in low-light conditions. The camera’s focus is fast and accurate, and the pictures captured are sharp and detailed. The quad-camera setup provides plenty of versatility to take pictures of different types, including wide-angle, macro, and portrait shots.\nPERFORMANCE The Infinix Note 7 is equipped with an octa-core processor that combines two Cortex-A75 cores with six Cortex-A55 cores, clocked at 2.0GHz. The phone’s processor is paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The phone runs on Android 10 with Infinix’s XOS 6.0 skin.\nThe phone’s performance is impressive, and it runs smoothly without any lags or hiccups. The phone’s RAM management is also great, and it can run multiple apps simultaneously without any issues. The phone’s gaming capabilities are not lacking either, and it can handle even heavy games without any problems.\nBATTERY LIFE The Infinix Note 7 comes with a massive 5,000mAh battery that can easily last for an entire day. The phone also supports fast charging, which means that it can be charged up to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone’s battery life is exceptional, and it will make sure that you don’t run out of battery, no matter what you’re doing.\nCONCLUSION The Infinix Note 7 is a game-changer in the world of smartphones. The phone’s design, camera, performance, and battery life make it a great choice for anyone in the market for a new phone. The phone is priced reasonably and delivers on every front. I would definitely recommend the Infinix Note 7 to anyone who wants a premium phone at an affordable price.\nThe Infinix Note 7 touched based at Dignited HQ over a week ago. It’s around that time we do our ritual unboxing and first impressions to whet your appetite with the promise of more to come. Seatbelts, please. Lean back and enjoy the ride.\nFirst off, kudos are in order for Infinix Mobility for keeping the price of their annual Infinix Note iterations roughly under $200 year on year. I know of a few phone manufacturers that get carried away by the popularity of their devices to quote us ridiculous sums for their later releases.\nThe thing about the Note series is that each new version is a little bit like Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans for those who you know their Harry Potter lore. Other than a familial family resemblance and the XOS skin, the Note versions don’t know each other since Adam. Case in point, the Infinix Note 5 runs Android One, the Note 6 has the Stylus pen and an AMOLED screen, while the Note 7…well, that’s what we’re here to find out.\nInfinix Note 7 Unboxing: box contents PhoneScreen protector + Araimo-branded transparent jacket“Super Charge” Wall ChargerMicro-USB cableInfinix in-ear headphonesSIM tray remover/pinCustomer Service card/Limited screen warranty Look and Feel Truth be told, the Infinix Note 7 is indeed a phablet, by which I mean a beefy device that straddles the size of a smartphone and a tablet. Weighing in at 206 grams and 6.95 inches, the Note 7 is a tall chunky device compared to its predecessors. I do have rather large man-sized hands but I still can’t wrap my hand around the device. The advertised ‘Aether Black’ color of the piece is in truth a shade of black and green. Not that we are complaining. Most of the devices I review come in black. I am not one to beef on a colorful device.\nThe box is gift-wrapped with the usual suspects. The fast charger will be your new best friend going forward. I love the addition of a screen protector and the jacket. My last review device didn’t have those and I have never been able to purchase them ever since. The earphones are generic and lifeless but as long as Infinix keeps the device prices low, I don’t mind this oversight in the least.\nRelated\nInfinix Note 6 first impressions: New X-Pen wields mightier skillsInfinix Note 5: Unboxing \u0026 First Impressions of Infinix Mobility’s Android One device A camera to die for Probably the wow factor in the Infinix Note 7 is the camera setup. I am no professional photographer, but I just can’t seem to get enough of those Instagram worthy shots and TikTok videos. All things considered, the camera just keeps you coming. It’s uncanny how good the shots get.\nThe Note 7 brings the heat with its 48MP Quad AI rear camera supported by a decent 16MP AI punch-hole front camera. Take this from me, this ensemble will convert you into your own overnight paparazzi. More on this later.\nSide-mounted fingerprint scanner Oh no! Left-handed Infinix fans won’t be amused with the right-hand controls on this device. We tried it out though and it’s not so bad. Unlike the rear/front fingerprint scanner, the side-mounted scanner is made for the right-hand thumb. Let’s not even pretend on this one.\nThe left side of the device houses the SIM card tray and that’s it. Infinix made the decision to cram the power button (doubles as a power button) and the volume keys on the right side.\nNot Micro-USB again! I don’t know about you, but it was my understanding that USB-C had taken over. Infinix clearly didn’t buy into this because the Note 7 still plugs into the dated Micro-USB connector.\nMatter of fact, the entire bottom setup of the Infinix devices has remained largely the same over the years. You get yourself an audio jack, microphone hole, Micro-USB port and speaker.\nPrice and Where to Buy The Infinix Note 7 retails for UGX 725,000 ($195) for 64GB variant, and UGX 825,000 ($221) for the 128GB variant in Uganda. Prices might vary depending on the region. Get yourself a piece at any Infinix branded offline store, or on Jumia online. Airtel Uganda in conjunction with Infinix Uganda has the Note 7 on sale loaded with 5G data to sweeten the deal.\nSpec Sheet Announced: 2020, AprilAvailable: 2020, JulyModel: Infinix X690Colors: Forest Green, Aether Black, Bolivia BlueSIM: Dual SIM (Nano-SIM)OS: Android 10, XOS 6.0Network: GSM, WCDMA, GPRS, EDGE, HSPA, 4G LTEDimensions: 173.4 x 79 x 8.8 mmWeight: 206 gDisplay: 720 x 1640 pixels (~258 ppi density) 6.95″ IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors (~83.7% screen-to-body ratio) Corning Gorilla GlassCPU: Mediatek Helio G70 (12 nm) Octa-core (2×2.0 GHz Cortex-A75 \u0026 6×1.7 GHz Cortex-A55) Mali-G52 2EEMC2Memory: 64GB 4GB RAM, 128GB 4GB RAM, 128GB 6GB RAMCamera: Front (16MP)/Rear (48M/AF+2M+2M+ Super low light video camera with Quad-flash light)Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, hotspot, Bluetooth 5.0, A2DP, LE, OTG, WiFi Direct.Sensors: Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Orientation, Ambient Light, Proximity, Compass, Fingerprint (side-mounted)Battery: Fast charging 18W Non-removable Li-Po 5000 mAh battery\nRelated ","wordCount":"1428","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie Oldham"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-note-7-unboxing-and-first-impressions-1362851/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>UNBOXING THE GAME-CHANGER: Infinix Note 7's First Impressions Will Leave You Breathless🤯</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 12, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1428 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Carrie Oldham</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#contents-of-the-box>CONTENTS OF THE BOX</a></li><li><a href=#the-design>THE DESIGN</a></li><li><a href=#camera>CAMERA</a></li><li><a href=#performance>PERFORMANCE</a></li><li><a href=#battery-life>BATTERY LIFE</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>CONCLUSION</a></li><li><a href=#infinix-note-7-unboxing-box-contents>Infinix Note 7 Unboxing: box contents</a></li><li><a href=#look-and-feel>Look and Feel</a></li><li><a href=#a-camera-to-die-for>A camera to die for</a></li><li><a href=#side-mounted-fingerprint-scanner>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner</a></li><li><a href=#not-micro-usb-again>Not Micro-USB again!</a></li><li><a href=#price-and-where-to-buy>Price and Where to Buy</a></li><li><a href=#spec-sheet>Spec Sheet</a><ul><li><a href=#related>Related</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=unboxing-the-game-changer-infinix-note-7s-first-impressions-will-leave-you-breathless>UNBOXING THE GAME-CHANGER: Infinix Note 7&rsquo;s First Impressions Will Leave You Breathless🤯<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#unboxing-the-game-changer-infinix-note-7s-first-impressions-will-leave-you-breathless>#</a></h1><p>Infinix Mobility, the premium smartphone manufacturers, recently launched their latest smartphone, the Infinix Note 7.
