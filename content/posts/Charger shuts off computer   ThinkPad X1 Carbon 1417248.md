If you own a Thinkpad X1 Carbon, you know how important it is to have a reliable charger. However, did you know that your charger might be slowly damaging your laptop? It's true, and this is a problem that affects many Thinkpad X1 Carbon users. In this article, we'll take a closer look at this issue and explain what you can do to protect your laptop.

First, let's take a look at how a charger can damage your laptop. The problem usually arises due to voltage spikes that occur when the charger is plugged in or removed. These voltage spikes can cause damage to the charging circuitry of your laptop, which can in turn lead to issues with charging, battery life, and performance.

Furthermore, cheap chargers tend to be less reliable and can also cause voltage spikes that could cause long-term damage to your laptop. To avoid these problems, it's important to invest in a high-quality charger that's designed specifically for your Thinkpad X1 Carbon. 

The official Lenovo charger is the best option since it's designed to work seamlessly with your laptop. However, there are other brands also offer quality chargers. 

Additionally, it's important to use the right charging cables. Cheap and low-quality cables might not be able to transfer power efficiently, which could also cause long-term damage to your laptop. Therefore, it's important to use high-quality charging cables that are compatible with USB-C, which is the type of charging port that the Thinkpad X1 Carbon uses.

Another issue to watch out for is overheating. If you notice that your charger is getting too hot, this could cause damage to both the charger and the laptop. Prolonged overheating could cause the plastic casing around the charger to melt, which could expose the electronics inside, creating potential fire hazards. This is why it's important to keep your charger away from heat sources, use it in well-ventilated areas, and turn off your laptop when it's not in use.

In conclusion, it's essential to invest in a quality charger that's designed for your Thinkpad X1 Carbon, use the right charging cables, and keep your charger away from heat sources. Doing so will protect your investment, and ensure that you can use your laptop for years to come without any issues. Remember, prevention is always better than cure, and taking care of your laptop's charging needs is an essential part of maintaining its overall health and longevity.

## Chosen Solution
 Every time I plug in my charger now it shuts down my computer or closes all of my windows. My battery life has diminished significantly as well. I have to shut down my computer in order to charge it. Please help!

 Does it shut down if you remove the battery?
IS there any info in the event log?
The only thing that comes to mind is that there could be an unexpected voltage drop when the battery starts charging and that the PC is shutting down to protect itself.
If that’s the case (and it’s a big IF) the issue is likely one of the following.
1)    The charger is damaged
2)    The charging circuit is damaged
3)    The battery is damaged.
If it runs without the battery in place I would buy a replacement charger since it’s the cheapest to replace.
If that didn’t fix it I would replace the battery.
If that didn’t fix it I would return both and treat my laptop as a desktop.

 this seems to be a common issue with the early generator X1.  I have an X1 3443 carbon model and have been seeing this issue periodically for years.  the conventional wisdom is that you need to replace the power port adapter (Lenovo part Misc Base Kit FRU part# 04W3914).  the item is touched on in the Lenovo forum - link below.
since I see this issue infrequently, I'm only now trying to replace this component.
