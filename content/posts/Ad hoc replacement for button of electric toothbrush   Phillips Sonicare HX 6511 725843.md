Do you often find yourself frustrated with the broken buttons on your Sonicare toothbrush? It's a common problem among Sonicare users, but there's a hack that might just change your brushing game forever. Say goodbye to those broken buttons with the Revolutionary Hack for Sonicare Toothbrushes!

The Sonicare Toothbrush is a popular electric toothbrush due to its effectiveness in removing plaque and improving overall oral hygiene. However, many users complain about the fragile buttons on the brush. Over time, these buttons often break off or become unresponsive, leaving the user unable to switch between brushing modes or turn their brush on or off.

But fear not! There is a way to avoid this frustrating issue. This hack doesn't require much effort, and all you need is a small piece of duct tape.

First, remove the used head from your toothbrush, and take a piece of duct tape. Cut it to the size of the button and place it over the button. The duct tape will act as a buffer between the button and the pressure from your fingers, preventing it from breaking or becoming unresponsive.

By employing this hack, you can use your Sonicare Toothbrush without worrying about the buttons breaking. Itâ€™s a simple and effective solution and can save you the inconvenience and expense of repairing or replacing your toothbrush.

This hack is especially useful for those who travel frequently or have children in the house. Children tend to be rough on their toothbrushes, which can lead to broken buttons. By using this hack, you can ensure that your Sonicare Toothbrush stays in good condition and performs optimally.

In conclusion, the Revolutionary Hack for Sonicare Toothbrushes is an easy and effective solution to a common issue that many Sonicare users face. With just a small piece of duct tape, you can protect your toothbrush buttons and avoid the inconvenience of broken or unresponsive buttons. So give it a try, and say goodbye to broken buttons forever!

## Chosen Solution
 See the picture
There is a hole (probably about 2cm wide) in the white plastic body, and in the hole there is an even smaller hole (about 1cm wide) and in the hole is the small round metallic switch. A small plastic frame is plugged in the hole, and the frame is covered with a green rubber. A long stick like thing is attached to the rubber. If you press the button, the stick presses the switch.

_                     <--switch
-------++---------------
The green rubber was worn out and stretched. It touched the switch erroneously. The switch is very sensitive. So I ripped off the green rubber. The button frame could easily be popped out.
Now, if I can get a replacement button, it would be really easy to pop the new button in the hole. But I could not find any replacement on eBay. I doubt Phillips would sell a replacement. So, I would like to find some ugly, ad-hoc way to press the switch. Since this is a toothbrush, the body can be covered with water. If there is any gap, water could get into the hole and ruin the circuit.
What can I create to press the switch? Do you have any ideas? It seems really a waste of resources if I have to throw away the whole toothbrush just because the rubber on the button is worn out.

 Hello
Same problem. saved centre portion which I place on switch with a dab of silicon seal on each side. Let dry and filled rest of hole with sealant.
Works good. do not get any glue on switch.
