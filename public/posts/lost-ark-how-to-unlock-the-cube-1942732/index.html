One of the game’s most intriguing features is the Cube, a powerful item that can enhance your abilities and boost your character’s stats. However, unlocking the Cube is no easy feat, and many players have struggled to unravel its secrets.\nFortunately, with the right strategy and a bit of patience, you can unravel the Cube’s mysteries and unleash its immense power. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how to unlock the Cube in Lost Ark and maximize its potential.\nStep 1: Complete the Main Storyline\nTo unlock the Cube, you first need to complete the game’s main storyline. This may seem like a daunting task, but it’s not as hard as it sounds. Just follow the quests as they come and take your time exploring the world of Lost Ark.\nStep 2: Reach Level 50\nOnce you’ve finished the main storyline, you need to reach level 50. This is where the real challenge begins since leveling up becomes much harder at this point. However, don’t worry; there are several ways to boost your experience gain and level up quickly.\nOne of the most effective methods is to team up with other players and complete dungeons together. Not only will this give you a significant boost in experience, but it’s also a lot more fun and engaging than grinding solo.\nStep 3: Complete the Cube Questline\nOnce you reach level 50, you’ll receive a quest from the Goddess Tiala that will lead you to the Cube. This questline consists of multiple missions, each requiring you to face challenging enemies and solve puzzles.\nCompleting this questline is crucial to unlocking the Cube, so make sure you take your time and explore each area thoroughly. Don’t rush through the missions, and pay attention to the clues and hints provided.\nStep 4: Obtain the Key Fragments\nAfter completing the Cube questline, you’ll need to collect nine key fragments to unlock the Cube. Each fragment is hidden in a different part of the world, and you’ll need to solve puzzles, defeat bosses, and explore caves to find them.\nThis step can be quite challenging, and it may take some time to collect all nine fragments. However, don’t give up, as the rewards are well worth the effort.\nStep 5: Unleash the Power of the Cube\nOnce you’ve collected all nine fragments, return to the Goddess Tiala and use them to unlock the Cube. Once unlocked, you can equip the Cube, and it will provide a significant boost to your character’s stats and abilities.\nHowever, the Cube is not a set-and-forget item. To maximize its potential, you’ll need to customize it to suit your playstyle. This involves selecting the right options, such as which stats to boost and which abilities to enhance.\nIn conclusion, unlocking the Cube is a lengthy and challenging process, but the rewards are well worth the effort. It provides a significant boost to your character and can help you become a more formidable adversary in the world of Lost Ark. Follow the steps outlined in this article, and you’ll be on your way to unleashing the power within the Cube.\nCube is an endgame PvE dungeon activity that yields higher rewards in Lost Ark. It is similar to the Tower and Chaos dungeons except in Cube the difficulty and type of challenges are indicated by different colors. Different types of floors or levels reward you as you proceed subsequently. You can invite up to three friends or go solo to grind on these challenges. But before grinding on the Cube, there are some prerequisites you need to complete. So, here’s our guide on how to unlock the cube dungeons in Lost Ark.\nHow to Unlock the Cube in Lost Ark? To unlock the cube dungeons, firstly you will need to be on at least level 50 or above. You will also need to complete a Cube guide quest. Then, you need an entrance ticket to Cube dungeons. You can get a cube entrance ticket from grinding on Chaos dungeons. You will have to kill the boss on the 2nd floor. These entrance tickets can only drop from daily energy. Alternatively, you can also get cube entrance tickets by purchasing them with Sylmael crystals. Once you have acquired these tickets, you can spend a ticket to enter the cube challenges. They require a single entrance ticket per entree, so make sure your team members have got one. You can also spend multiple tickets to yield better rewards. Now that you have understood how to unlock the cube, scroll till the end to find out what are the Cube Dungeons.\nWhat is a Cube in Lost Ark? There are 19 floors or levels in the Cube dungeons which are time-limited. Like most of the challenges where the difficulty increases as you proceed, in the Cube dungeons the difficulty changes randomly from floor to floor. The type of the level is indicated by the beam of a certain color coming out of the platform. You can also check the objective of the level to the top left of the screen. There are mainly five different types of levels and they are as follows:\nWhite: On this floor, you will face all the low-tier enemies. Magenta: This is the floor full of elite enemies. Red: You will have to eliminate a boss or bosses along with some of the enemies to proceed to the next floor. Blue: On this floor, you will face all the exploding enemies. Gold: All you have to do on this floor or level is to collect the treasure chests containing different rewards. As you grind on Cube Dungeons, you will also receive buffs and debuffs that will vary randomly from floor to floor. Some of the examples of buffs include invincibility while debuffs can include death at the end of the timer. You can see these apply to your character at the top right of the screen.\nRewards Similar to different dungeons, you will receive rewards based on the floors you have completed. Make a note that there are no respawns once you die. But not to worry, if you fail you get rewards accordingly to the previous floor you have completed. Mentioned below are the rewards you will receive as you grind on different floors:\nFloor 1st to 3rd: No rewards Floor 4th to 7th: Bronze Chest Floor 8th to 10th: Silver Chest Floor 11th to 12th: Gold Chest Floor 13th to 15th: Platinum Chest Floor 15th and beyond: Diamond Chest That’s all on how to unlock the Cube in Lost Ark.
