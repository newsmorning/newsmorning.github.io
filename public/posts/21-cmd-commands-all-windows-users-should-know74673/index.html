With these powerful tools at your disposal, you’ll be able to diagnose problems, tweak your settings, and perform all sorts of tasks that would otherwise be impossible. So, if you’re ready to take your Windows experience to the next level, start exploring the powerful world of the Command Prompt today!\nThe Windows command prompt is a feature that’s been a core part of the Windows operating system for a long time. There are some CMD commands that are so useful and easy to use that even regular users see the Windows command prompt as a key part of the operating system.\nThere are always rumors that it will be phased out at some point, but that’s unlikely to happen any time soon.\nThe following are 21 of the best CMD commands you should know if you want to have more control over your Windows PC.\nAlso, be sure to check out our YouTube video where we go over the commands listed in this article:\n1. ASSOC: Fix File Associations One of the most powerful tools in the CMD command library is the ASSOC command.\nYour computer associates certain file extensions with certain programs. This is how your computer knows to open Adobe when you double click a PDF file, or Microsoft Word when you double click a DOC file.\nYou can view all the file associations your computer knows about by typing ASSOC in the command window. You’ll see the file extension and the program it’s associated with.\nYou can set the association by typing something like assoc .doc=Word.Document.8.\n2. FC: File Compare Sometimes when files are changed over time, it’s hard to remember what the differences were between versions. You may not know that a CMD command offers the ability to compare files and see all differences, but it’s true.\nThe FC command performs either an ascii or a binary file comparison and will list all of the differences that it finds.\nFc /a File1.txt File2.txt will compare two ascii files.\nFc /b Picture1.jpg Picture2.jpg will do a binary compare on two images.\n3. IPCONFIG: IP Configuration Network troubleshooting is never simple, but one command that makes it much easier is IPCONFIG.\nUsing this command in the CMD command prompt returns detailed information about your current network adapter connection including:\nCurrent IP AddressSubnet MaskDefault Gateway IPCurrent domain This information can help you troubleshoot router issues and other connection issues you could be having with your network adapter.\n4. NETSTAT: Network Statistics Concerned that you could have malware running on your computer that’s connecting to internet locations without you knowing about it?\nIf you run a NETSTAT command in the command prompt, you can get a list of all active TCP connections from your computer.\n5. PING: Send Test Packets An IT Analyst’s best friend is the PING command. Running this command sends test packets over the network to the target system.\nYou can use the PING command to test whether your computer can access another computer, a server, or even a website. It can help with revealing network disconnections. It also provides transit time for the packets in milliseconds, so it also reveals a bad network connection as well.\n6. TRACERT: Trace Route TRACERT is a fascinating Windows Command to use. If you’re ever curious to see the path your internet traffic takes to get from your browser to a remote system like Google servers, you can use TRACERT to see it.\nThe command stands for “Trace Route”, which sends packets out to a remote destination (server or website), and provides you with all of the following information:\nNumber of hops (intermediate servers) before getting to the destinationTime it takes to get to each hopThe IP and sometimes the name of each hop TRACERT can reveal how the routes of your internet requests change depending where you’re accessing the web. It also helps with troubleshooting a router or switch on a local network that may be problematic.\n7. POWERCFG: Power Configuration Are you frustrated with how quickly your laptop seems to run out of power? It could be that your power settings are configured as efficiently as possible. There’s a windows CMD command called POWERCFG (power configuration) that can help. Run the command prompt as an administrator and type powercfg – energy to get a full power efficiency report.\nThe process can take up to about a minute, but when it’s done, you’ll see whether there are any warnings or errors that might help you improve the power efficiency of your system.\nView the energy-report.html file to see the details of those errors and warnings.\n8. SHUTDOWN: Turn Off Computer The SHUTDOWN command is a pretty versatile command that lets you shutdown the computer but control the behavior of that shutdown. It’s commonly used as a scheduled task or part of an IT batch job after patches have been applied to a computer system.\nTyping shutdown /i from the command prompt will initiate a shutdown, but it’ll upon a GUI to give the user an option on whether to restart or do a full shutdown. If you don’t want to have any GUI pop up, you can just issue a shutdown /s command.\nThere is a long list of other parameters you can use to do a log off, hibernate, restart, and more. Just type shutdown without any arguments to see them all.\n9. SYSTEMINFO: System Information If you need to know what brand of network card you have, processor details, or the exact version of your Windows OS, the SYSTEMINFO command can help.\nThis command polls your system and pulls the most important information about your system. It lists the information in a clean format that’s easy to read.\n10. SFC: System File Checker If you’re ever concerned that a virus or some other software might have corrupted your core system files, there’s a Windows command that can scan those files and ensure their integrity.\nYou need to launch CMD as administrator (right click and choose Run as Administrator). Typing SFC /SCANNOW will check the integrity of all protected system files. If a problem is found, the files will be repaired with backed-up system files.\nThe SFC command also lets you:\n/VERIFYONLY: Check the integrity but don’t repair the files./SCANFILE: Scan the integrity of specific files and fix if corrupted./VERIFYFILE: Verify the integrity of specific files but don’t repair them./OFFBOOTDIR: Use this to do repairs on an offline boot directory./OFFWINDIR: Use this to do repairs on an offline Windows directory./OFFLOGFILE: Specify a path to save a log file with scan results. The scan can take up to 10 or 15 minutes, so give it time.\n11. NET USE: Map drives If you want to map a new drive, you could always open File Explorer, right click on This PC, and go through the Map Network Drive wizard. However, using the NET USE command, you can do the same thing with one command string.\nFor example, if you have a share folder on a computer on your network called \\OTHER-COMPUTER\\SHARE, you can map this as your own Z: drive by typing the command:\nNet use Z: “\\OTHER-COMPUTER\\SHARE” /persistent:yes\nThe persistent switch tells your computer that you want this drive remapped every time you log back into your computer.\n12. CHKDSK: Check Disk While the SFC command only checks the integrity of core system files, you can use the CHKDSK command to scan an entire drive.\nThe command to check the C: drive and repair any problems, launch the command window as an administrator and type CHKDSK /f C:.\nThis command checks for things like:\nFile fragmentationDisk errorsBad sectors The command can fix any disk errors (if possible). When the command is finished, you’ll see a status of the scan and what actions were taken.\n13. SCHTASKS: Schedule Tasks Windows comes with a wizard for creating scheduled tasks. For example, maybe you have a BAT file stored on C:\\temp that you want to run every day at noon.\nYou’d have to click through the Scheduled Task wizard to configure this. Or you can type a single SCHTASKS command to set it up.\nSCHTASKS /Create /SC HOURLY /MO 12 /TR Example /TN c:\\temp\\File1.bat\nThe scheduled switch accepts arguments like minute, hourly, daily, and monthly. Then you specify the frequency with the /MO command.\nIf you typed the command correctly, you’ll see the response, SUCCESS: The scheduled task “Example” has successfully been created.\n14. ATTRIB: Change File Attributes In Windows, you can change file attributes by right clicking on a file and finding the right property to change. However, instead of hunting around for the file attribute, you can use the ATTRIB command to set the file attributes.\nFor example, if you type: ATTRIB +R +H C:\\temp\\File1.bat, it’ll set File1.bat as a hidden, read-only file.\nThere is no response when it’s successful, so unless you see an error message, the command worked.\nOther Windows CMD Commands As you can see, there are some powerful and useful things you can do with the Windows command prompt, if you know the right commands.\nBelieve it or not, there are even more commands that will give you the ability to do some things you probably never realized just by typing a simple command.\nBITSADMIN: Initiate upload or download jobs over the network or internet and monitor the current state of those file transfers.COLOR: Change the background color of the command prompt window.COMP: Compare the contents of any two files to see the differences.FIND/FINDSTR: Search for strings inside of any ASCII files.PROMPT: Change the command prompt from C:\u003e to something else. TITLE: Change the title of the command prompt window.REGEDIT: Edit keys in the Windows registry (use with caution).ROBOCOPY: A powerful file copy utility built right into Windows. If you’re interested in learning more, Microsoft offers a full list of all of the Windows CMD commands included in the latest version of the Windows OS.\n","wordCount":"2259","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Wendy Santiago"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/21-cmd-commands-all-windows-users-should-know74673/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Are You Ready to Unlock The Secrets of Your PC? 21 Must-Know Cmd Commands for Windows Users!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 22, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2259 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Wendy Santiago</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-assoc-fix-file-associations>1.

information about your current network adapter connection including:</p><ul><li>Current IP AddressSubnet MaskDefault Gateway IPCurrent domain</li></ul><p>This information can help you troubleshoot router issues and
other connection issues you could be having with your network adapter.</p><h2 id=4-netstat-network-statistics>4. NETSTAT: Network Statistics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-netstat-network-statistics>#</a></h2><p>Concerned that you could have malware running on your
computer that’s connecting to internet locations without you knowing about it?</p><p>If you run a NETSTAT
command in the command prompt, you can get a list of all active TCP connections
from your computer.</p><h2 id=5-ping-send-test-packets>5. PING: Send Test Packets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-ping-send-test-packets>#</a></h2><p>An IT Analyst’s best friend is the PING command.  Running this
command sends test packets over the network to the target system.</p><p>You can use the PING command to test whether your computer
can access another computer, a server, or even a website. It can help with
revealing network disconnections. It also provides transit time for the packets
in milliseconds, so it also reveals a bad network connection as well.</p><h2 id=6-tracert-trace-route>6. TRACERT: Trace Route<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-tracert-trace-route>#</a></h2><p>TRACERT is a
fascinating Windows Command to use. If you’re ever curious to see the path your
internet traffic takes to get from your browser to a remote system like Google
servers, you can use TRACERT to see it.</p><p>The command stands for “Trace Route”, which sends packets
out to a remote destination (server or website), and provides you with all of
the following information:</p><ul><li>Number of hops (intermediate servers) before</li><li>getting to the destinationTime it takes to get to each hopThe IP and sometimes the name of each hop</li></ul><p>TRACERT can reveal how the routes of your internet requests
change depending where you’re accessing the web. It also helps with
troubleshooting a router or switch on a local network that may be problematic.</p><h2 id=7-powercfg-power-configuration>7. POWERCFG: Power Configuration<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7-powercfg-power-configuration>#</a></h2><p>Are you frustrated with how quickly your laptop seems to run
out of power? It could be that your power settings are configured as
efficiently as possible. There’s a windows CMD command called POWERCFG (power configuration) that can
help. Run the command prompt as an administrator and type powercfg – energy to get a full power efficiency report.</p><p>The process can take up to about a minute, but when it’s done,
you’ll see whether there are any warnings or errors that might help you improve
the power efficiency of your system.</p><p>View the energy-report.html file to see the details of those
errors and warnings.</p><h2 id=8-shutdown-turn-off-computer>8. SHUTDOWN: Turn Off Computer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#8-shutdown-turn-off-computer>#</a></h2><p>The SHUTDOWN
command is a pretty versatile command that lets you shutdown the computer but
control the behavior of that shutdown. It’s commonly used as a scheduled task
or part of an IT batch job after patches have been applied to a computer
system.</p><p>Typing shutdown /i
from the command prompt will initiate a shutdown, but it’ll upon a GUI to give
the user an option on whether to restart or do a full shutdown. If you don’t
want to have any GUI pop up, you can just issue a shutdown /s command.</p><p>There is a long list of other parameters you can use to do a
log off, hibernate, restart, and more. Just type shutdown without any arguments to see them all.</p><h2 id=9-systeminfo-system-information>9. SYSTEMINFO: System Information<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#9-systeminfo-system-information>#</a></h2><p>If you need to know what brand of network card you have,
processor details, or the exact version of your Windows OS, the SYSTEMINFO command can help.</p><p>This command polls your system and pulls the most important
information about your system. It lists the information in a clean format
that’s easy to read.</p><h2 id=10-sfc-system-file-checker>10. SFC: System File Checker<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#10-sfc-system-file-checker>#</a></h2><p>If you’re ever concerned that a virus or some other software
might have corrupted your core system files, there’s a Windows command that can
scan those files and ensure their integrity.</p><p>You need to launch CMD as administrator (right click and
choose Run as Administrator). Typing
SFC /SCANNOW will check the integrity of all protected system files. If a
problem is found, the files will be repaired with backed-up system files.</p><p>The SFC command also lets you:</p><ul><li>/VERIFYONLY:</li><li>Check the integrity but don’t repair the files./SCANFILE:</li><li>Scan the integrity of specific files and fix if corrupted./VERIFYFILE:</li><li>Verify the integrity of specific files but don’t repair them./OFFBOOTDIR:</li><li>Use this to do repairs on an offline boot directory./OFFWINDIR:</li><li>Use this to do repairs on an offline Windows directory./OFFLOGFILE:</li><li>Specify a path to save a log file with scan results.</li></ul><p>The scan can take up to 10 or 15 minutes, so give it time.</p><h2 id=11-net-use-map-drives>11. NET USE: Map drives<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#11-net-use-map-drives>#</a></h2><p>If you want to map a new drive, you could always open File
Explorer, right click on This PC, and go through the Map Network Drive wizard.
However, using the NET USE command,
you can do the same thing with one command string.</p><p>For example, if you have a share folder on a computer on
your network called \OTHER-COMPUTER\SHARE, you can
map this as your own Z: drive by typing the command:</p><p>Net use Z: “\OTHER-COMPUTER\SHARE”
/persistent:yes</p><p>The persistent
switch tells your computer that you want this drive remapped every time you log
back into your computer.</p><h2 id=12-chkdsk-check-disk>12. CHKDSK: Check Disk<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#12-chkdsk-check-disk>#</a></h2><p>While the SFC command only checks the integrity of core
system files, you can use the CHKDSK
command to scan an entire drive.</p><p>The command to check the C: drive and repair any problems,
launch the command window as an administrator and type CHKDSK /f C:.</p><p>This command checks for things like:</p><ul><li>File fragmentationDisk errorsBad sectors</li></ul><p>The command can fix any disk errors (if possible). When the
command is finished, you’ll see a status of the scan and what actions were
taken.</p><h2 id=13-schtasks-schedule-tasks>13. SCHTASKS: Schedule Tasks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#13-schtasks-schedule-tasks>#</a></h2><p>Windows comes with a wizard for creating scheduled tasks.
For example, maybe you have a BAT file stored on C:\temp that you want to run
every day at noon.</p><p>You’d have to click through the Scheduled Task wizard to
configure this. Or you can type a single SCHTASKS
command to set it up.</p><p>SCHTASKS /Create /SC
HOURLY /MO 12 /TR Example /TN c:\temp\File1.bat</p><p>The scheduled switch accepts arguments like minute, hourly,
daily, and monthly. Then you specify the frequency with the /MO command.</p><p>If you typed the command correctly, you’ll see the response,
SUCCESS: The scheduled task “Example”
has successfully been created.</p><h2 id=14-attrib-change-file-attributes>14. ATTRIB: Change File Attributes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#14-attrib-change-file-attributes>#</a></h2><p>In Windows, you can change file attributes by right clicking
on a file and finding the right property to change. However, instead of hunting
around for the file attribute, you can use the ATTRIB command to set the file attributes.</p><p>For example, if you type: ATTRIB +R +H C:\temp\File1.bat, it’ll set File1.bat as a hidden,
read-only file.</p><p>There is no response when it’s successful, so unless you see
an error message, the command worked.</p><h2 id=other-windows-cmd-commands>Other Windows CMD Commands<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#other-windows-cmd-commands>#</a></h2><p>As you can see, there are some powerful and useful things
you can do with the Windows command prompt, if you know the right commands.</p><p>Believe it or not, there are even more commands that will
give you the ability to do some things you probably never realized just by
typing a simple command.</p><ul><li>BITSADMIN:</li><li>Initiate upload or download jobs over the network or internet and monitor the</li><li>current state of those file transfers.COLOR:</li><li>Change the background color of the command prompt window.COMP:</li><li>Compare the contents of any two files to see the differences.FIND/FINDSTR:</li><li>Search for strings inside of any ASCII files.PROMPT:</li><li>Change the command prompt from C:> to something else. TITLE:</li><li>Change the title of the command prompt window.REGEDIT:</li><li>Edit keys in the Windows registry (use with caution).ROBOCOPY:</li><li>A powerful file copy utility built right into Windows.</li></ul><p>If you’re interested in learning more, Microsoft offers a full list of all of the Windows CMD commands included in the latest version of the Windows OS.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/a-part-came-lose-looking-for-origin-lg-g5-1916608/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>You won't believe what we found when we took apart the LG G5 - a mysterious missing piece with an unknown origin!</span></a>
