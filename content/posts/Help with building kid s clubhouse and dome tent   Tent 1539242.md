# Gone are Boring Playdates! Discover How To Build The Coolest Kids Clubhouse And Dome Tent!

As parents, we want to create fun, memorable experiences for our children, and what better way to do that than to build a cool clubhouse or dome tent for them to play in?

Gone are the days of boring playdates where children sit in front of a screen for hours. With a little creativity and effort, you can create a space that will inspire them to use their imagination, play and make memories that will last a lifetime.

In this article, we will explore some tips and tricks for building the coolest kids clubhouse and dome tent.

## Clubhouse

A clubhouse is a classic idea that kids love. It provides a special space for them to hang out with friends, read books or have indoor picnics. But how do you create a clubhouse that your child will love?

### Step 1: Choose a Location

The first step is to decide where to build the clubhouse. Do you have a spacious backyard or patio? Maybe you have a spare room or a corner in your living room that can be converted into a play area. Once you have decided on the location, it's time to get creative.

### Step 2: Take Inspiration from Your Child

Ask your child what they would like in their clubhouse. Do they want a space to play dress-up, have tea parties, or build with Legos? Make a list of your child's ideas and brainstorm ways to incorporate them into the design.

### Step 3: Make the Space Cozy

The next step is to create a cozy space for your child. Add soft rugs, bean bags or a plush couch, and hang curtains or a canopy. Use colorful and comfortable cushions in the right places to ensure maximum comfort.

### Step 4: Personalize the Space

Add a personal touch to the clubhouse by hanging pictures, artwork or posters that your child loves. You can also use a chalkboard or whiteboard to let them write or draw on.

### Step 5: Add Games and Activities

Lastly, add games and activities for your child to enjoy. Board games, puzzles or interactive toys will keep them entertained and encourage socialization with friends.

## Dome Tent

A dome tent is a fun and easy way to create a space for your child to play, read or have a sleepover. A tent set up in the backyard or playroom can be a great way to escape from the world and have fun. Here are some steps to consider:

### Step 1: Choose an Area

Select an area where you will set up the tent. Consider the amount of space available and make sure the area is safe and comfortable.

### Step 2: Purchase or Build a Tent

You can buy a tent online, or you can create your own by following a tutorial from YouTube. Once you have it, you are ready to make it comfortable.

### Step 3: Add Comfort and Decoration

Use soft blankets, pillows, rugs, and other items to make the space cozy and comfortable. Add fun decorations like lights, streamers or posters that your child loves.

### Step 4: Make It Interactive

Make it interactive by adding board games, crafts, or other activities. Create a place where your child and their friends can have fun and explore their creativity.

### Step 5: Enjoy the Memories

Take photos, videos or simply sit back and watch as your child creates memories in their new dome tent.

In conclusion, building a kids clubhouse or a dome tent is a great way to provide children with a space to play, read, relax or have a sleepover with friends. With a little effort and creativity, you can create a fun and exciting atmosphere that will keep your child happy and entertained. So, ditch the boring playdates and create an incredible space that your child will never forget.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a tent (Mambo Combo tent) and playhouse like the below picture for my kids with the following dimensions
http://www.amazon.com/Ryans-Room-Mambo-C...
One (1) Clubhouse Tent - 38"W x 28.5"D x 42.5"H
One (1) Dome Tent - 47"W x 47"D x 35"H
Unfortunately,few parts of(i.e. poles and connectors are missing which makes it unusable. The company no longer sells the replacement poles.
I did find other products which has replacement poles but of different dimensions . For example  58" x 48" x 58" High. Not sure if I can still buy this as replacement and if it still would work.

if not any other suggestions are welcome.
Thanks

 Get the PVC poles “from your second link” that are just a little longer than you need.  Then use a hack saw to cut them down to the size you need.

 Old thread but anyway I also had some problems like this and I found the solution on gardeningtoolshq.com where I bought many useful things that help me a lot in the garden.
From here I bought even a trampoline and whenever my grandchildren come to me, they are the happiest because they can jump there as much as they want.
In addition, I put a pool next to it so that they feel like heaven and I feel happiest seeing their smiles.
