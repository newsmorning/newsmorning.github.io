Title: Don't Make This iPhone 6 Mistake - Changing the Back Cover Could Leave Your Phone LIFELESS!

In an age where personalization is at its peak, almost everyone wants to put their personal stamp on whatever device they have. This desire has led to many becoming creative to an extent of changing the exterior of their iPhone 6 cover. However, as easy and tempting as it may seem, changing the back cover of your iPhone 6 could lead to undesirable consequences.

Many people make the mistake of thinking that changing the back cover of their iPhone 6 is as easy as popping off the old one and snapping on the new one. In truth, it's a lot more complicated than that, and if you don't have the knowledge or expertise, you could end up with a dead phone.

The back cover of your iPhone 6 is a vital component that houses essential parts such as the battery. When you remove the back cover, you expose delicate parts that can easily get damaged if you don't know what you're doing. Moreover, when you attempt to remove the back cover, you could accidentally damage the phone's internal components, rendering it lifeless. 

Most people who try to change their iPhone 6 back cover are seeking an attractive option at a lower price. However, they put themselves at risk of damaging their phone or suffering the long-term consequences of a poorly installed cover. Some cheap back covers can be too thick or too thin causing them not to fit correctly, and this could potentially cause damages to other phone components. Therefore, it is always important to use original parts and engage the services of experts when making any changes to your iPhone 6.

Replacing the back cover of an iPhone 6 requires specific tools and knowledge, and if you lack either of these, it is highly recommended to take your phone to a professional for repairs. It may cost more, but it is ultimately cheaper than buying a new phone or spending more fixing damages done by your attempt to replace the back cover.

In conclusion, if you want to personalize the exterior of your iPhone 6, it is best to stick with phone cases or skins, and leave the actual back cover intact. Changing the back cover is a risky move that should only be done by experts. So, don't make the mistake of changing your iPhone 6 back cover; it could leave it lifeless!

## Chosen Solution
 I changed all the componentes from the inside of the iphone to a new back cover but the iphone does not turn on, i checked all the components and all seem to be fine, any suggestion?

 Can it connect to a PC?  let us know what you have tried so we dont repeat what you have done

 I would double check battery and power button contacts to make sure they are seated properly. Did you tear it down in a static free environment? With proper ground out?
