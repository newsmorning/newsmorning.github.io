Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When This Sony Xperia Z3 Owner Encountered Adhesive Issues - The Solution Will Shock You!

Introduction:
The Sony Xperia Z3 is a stunning phone that offers powerful features and unmatchable performance. However, like every other phone, it is not perfect, and the users can encounter problems frequently. One such issue that can lead to a significant headache is the adhesive issues, where the back panel of the phone starts coming off, making it unusable. In this article, we will discuss the experience of a Sony Xperia Z3 owner who encountered adhesive issues and the solution that will shock you!

The Problem:
The owner of the Sony Xperia Z3 started noticing the phone's back panel lifting off and forming a bubble-like shape, making the phone unusable. He tried pressing down the back panel to stick it again, but it would come off after a few hours. The user was frustrated as he could not use his phone, and the situation was worsening with each passing day.

The Solution:
The user was researching online to find a solution, and that's when he came across a surprising solution. The solution was to use a regular hairdryer to heat up the adhesive on the back panel and paste it back. The user was surprised and skeptical about this method, but he decided to give it a try.

The Process:
The first thing the user did was to turn the hairdryer to its maximum heat level and directed the airflow on the back panel adhesive. He kept the hairdryer on for two minutes, which was enough to heat up the adhesive. The user then applied pressure on the back panel, making sure that the adhesive stuck correctly before cooling down. After pressing down and holding for a few minutes, the user turned off the hairdryer and let the phone cool down for 10-15 minutes.

The Results:
To the user's surprise, the back panel was firmly attached to the phone, and there were no signs of bubbles or lifting. The user was thrilled to use his phone again and was glad that he could find a quick and easy solution to the adhesive issues.

Conclusion:
The Sony Xperia Z3 is a great phone, but users can run into adhesive issues with their backs coming off. However, as seen in this article, users can solve this problem without visiting a repair shop or buying a new phone. With just a regular hairdryer and some patience, users can solve adhesive issues and continue to enjoy their Sony Xperia Z3 without any further problems.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello
So i repair many Sony phones that are mainly based on glue, and even tho i have the correct adhesive strip for the job, it seems the 30% of the phones repaired, the adhesive will not stick the LCD/digitizer properly to the front of the device.
i apply heat after placing the lcd/digitizer on and i use small "clamps" to keep it all in place.
Tips and tricks boys?

 What type of adhesive are you using? How do you apply the adhesive? What sort of material are you gluing together? Glass on Metal; Metal on Plastic; or Glass on Plastic?
For many different material I prefer two part epoxy which if you have clamps or something you can use to hold the two different materials together you can wait for the two part epoxy to dry. But if I do not have the time to hold the two materials together or the materials are hard to get to stick together I use Superglue specifically one with a brush applicator which is easier to make sure the glue is applied evenly.
If it is for a material that has high heat and has a constant pressure already holding the materials together like a Gasket joint I use RTV which will create a water proof seal and resist high heat. RTV is also good for keeping electronic wiring together "close" but separate for to maintain a plastic covering.  You can also use a glue gun for this also but RTV has the High Heat protection that some circuits need.
I do not know if this answers any of your questions, but I hope it helps someone.
