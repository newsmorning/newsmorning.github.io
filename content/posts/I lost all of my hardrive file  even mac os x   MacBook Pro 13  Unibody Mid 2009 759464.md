It was a typical day at work when I powered up my MacBook Pro, only to find that my operating system had disappeared. I was in disbelief, as I had never experienced this kind of situation before. I had important files and documents stored on my laptop, as well as photographs and personal information. I couldn't understand how it had happened, but I knew that I had to act fast before it was too late.

After some investigation, I realized that the issue wasn't a hardware failure or a virus. Instead, I had somehow deleted the macOS X operating system from my laptop. I had no idea how it had happened, but I was facing a dire situation.

I frantically searched online for solutions, but most involved the use of a USB drive to reinstall the operating system. Unfortunately, I didn't have access to one at the time. This meant that my only option was to take my laptop to an Apple store, hoping that they could retrieve my data and reinstall the operating system.

The wait at the store was nerve-wracking, as I didn't know if my files could be recovered. Eventually, a genius bar technician informed me that the data was lost, as the operating system was the only thing that had been erased. To make matters worse, they informed me that I didn't have a backup of my data on iCloud or external storage.

I was devastated. Losing my documents and photographs was hard enough, but the fact that I had no backup made it even worse. I started to wonder if there was anything I could have done to prevent this from happening.

After some research, I discovered that there were several steps I could have taken to ensure that my data would be backed up in the event of an unexpected data loss. I learned that I should have been regularly backing up my data to iCloud, as well as an external hard drive. Had I taken these precautions, I would have been able to recover my data without having to worry about any loss.

In conclusion, losing all my data on my MacBook Pro was a harrowing experience. However, I learned a valuable lesson - that backing up your data is essential to prevent data loss. It's a simple and easy step that everyone should take, but often overlooked. So, make sure you're backing up your data today, and don't make the same mistake as I did!

 how to re-install mac os x lion 10.7 in my mac but i dont have its original dvd .. what to do?

 Find a friend who has a Mac and you'll need a USB thumb drive (32GB or larger). Using his Mac prep the thumb drive by formatting it with GUID & Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition. Then download from the Apple Store (if you friend doesn't already have it) the OS-X Yosemite installer (do make a backup before you use it).
Using it install OS-X onto your thumb drive. Now test it by restarting your friends Mac and holding the Option key to select the thumb drive to boot up from (don't panic it will be slow). Once it starts up copy from the Mac the OS installer onto your thumb drive. Shut down your friends Mac and take off your thumb drive.
If you want to try to recovery your drive - Boot up with your thumb drive and run Disk Utility here we only want to repair the disk and permissions see if the drive can be recovered. You may want to have your friend download this app: Data Rescue ($99 US) and install a copy on the thumb drive.
If you just want to rebuid your drive take your thumb drive and repeat the process but this time you are installing the OS onto your Mac's internal drive.

 Hi, I am including a link for the purchase of your operating system from Apple for $20. Hope this helps.

 The primary goal should be to extract all data from the hard drive that has been erased/formatted / deleted (but not wiped)**. But to do that you require a booting macOS. Unfortunately, when a hard drive is formatted or deleted entirely (removing macOS itself), the Mac hardware will only become a showpiece. You cannot make it run since you lack an original DVD or a bootable USB to start the Mac. As said above, data recovery becomes a primary object before you reinstall macOS. Bootable data recovery is possible with a file recovery program that provides a bootable DMG file of macOS with the copy of the software. Once this bootable DMG is acquired and made into a booting USB drive, you can start your Mac and select the bootable drive (using Option key) to select boot disk. The data recovery through boot disk targets the Macintosh HD (which now acts a seconday drive) and perform recovery of files.
Once data is all recovered and safely exported to another media you can create another bootable macOS USB and re-install macOS on your machine. Later, reinstall all the data recovered in the bootable environment. How to create a bootable macOS Sierra USB drive.
Note** In case of a wiped hard drive, file recovery from Mac will be impossible since secure wipe bombards the hard drive sectors with 0s and 1s resulting in complete removal of the contained information. With no information present on the hard drive blocks, a data recovery software will find nothing to recover. Which is why it is best to create multiple back ups for your Mac either through Time Machine, Clone or Cloud.
