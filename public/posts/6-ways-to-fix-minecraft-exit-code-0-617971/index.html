Minecraft is a popular sandbox game, loved by millions of players around the world. However, one issue that players have been struggling with is the Minecraft Exit Code 0 error. This error can be frustrating, as it often results in the game crashing or freezing, leaving players unable to play.\nThankfully, there are several ways to fix this error. In this article, we’ll explore six foolproof fixes that you can use to say goodbye to the Minecraft Exit Code 0 error for good.\nFix #1: Update Your Graphics Drivers One potential cause of the Minecraft Exit Code 0 error is outdated or corrupted graphics drivers. To fix this, you should update your graphics drivers to the latest version.\nTo update your graphics drivers, follow these steps:\nOpen the Device Manager on your computer. Locate the Display Adapters option and click on it. Right-click on your graphics card and select Update Driver. Follow the on-screen instructions to update your graphics driver to the latest version. Once your graphics driver is updated, launch Minecraft and see if the Exit Code 0 error persists.\nFix #2: Allocate More RAM to Minecraft Minecraft requires a certain amount of RAM to run smoothly. If you’re running Minecraft with insufficient RAM, you may experience the Exit Code 0 error.\nTo allocate more RAM to Minecraft, follow these steps:\nLaunch the Minecraft Launcher. Select the Installations tab. Click on the three dots next to the Minecraft installation you want to allocate more RAM to. Select More Options. Find the line that says -Xmx2G and change the number to the amount of RAM you want to allocate (e.g. -Xmx4G for 4GB of RAM). Click Save and launch Minecraft. Fix #3: Disable Mods or Resource Packs Mods and resource packs can sometimes conflict with Minecraft and cause the Exit Code 0 error. If you’re using mods or resource packs, try disabling them and see if that solves the issue.\nTo disable mods or resource packs, follow these steps:\nLaunch the Minecraft Launcher. Select the Installations tab. Click on the three dots next to the Minecraft installation you want to disable mods or resource packs for. Select Edit. In the Edit Installation screen, uncheck any mods or resource packs you have installed. Click Save and launch Minecraft. Fix #4: Repair Your Minecraft Installation Corrupted game files can also cause the Minecraft Exit Code 0 error. To fix this, you can repair your Minecraft installation.\nTo repair your Minecraft installation, follow these steps:\nLaunch the Minecraft Launcher. Select the Installations tab. Click on the three dots next to the Minecraft installation you want to repair. Select Repair. Wait for the repair process to complete. Launch Minecraft and see if the issue is resolved. Fix #5: Disable Antivirus Software Antivirus software can sometimes interfere with Minecraft and cause the Exit Code 0 error. If you’re using antivirus software, try disabling it temporarily and see if that solves the issue.\nTo disable antivirus software, follow the instructions provided by the software manufacturer.\nFix #6: Update Java Minecraft relies on Java to run, so outdated or corrupted Java installations can cause the Exit Code 0 error.\nTo update Java, follow these steps:\nGo to the Java website and download the latest version of Java. Install the Java update on your computer. Launch Minecraft and see if the issue is resolved. Conclusion The Minecraft Exit Code 0 error can be frustrating, but with these six foolproof fixes, you can say goodbye to it for good. Whether you need to update your graphics drivers, allocate more RAM to Minecraft, or disable mods or resource packs, these fixes should help you get back to enjoying Minecraft without any issues.\nSoftware exit codes should tell you what went wrong, but Minecraft’s Exit Codes rarely do that. When the game crashes with the “Exit Code: 0” message, you are left wondering how to fix the problem.\nExit Code 0 only means Minecraft has successfully exited, but not why. It can be due to various reasons, from running out of memory to incompatible game files. Let’s see how to fix these possible issues and get Minecraft working again.\nFix 1: Close Conflicting Programs The most common reason for Minecraft to close with an exit code 0 is low memory. If your computer meets the system requirements of the game, conflicting programs might be the reason for getting this error code.\nMemory-heavy applications like Google Chrome can cause issues for Minecraft if left running in the background. Closing such programs frees up more memory for the game engine, allowing it to run smoothly.\nTo see what programs are running on your computer – and how much memory is in use—open the Task Manager. Use the Ctrl + Shift + Esc keyboard shortcut or press Ctrl + Alt + Del and select Task Manager from the options presented.\nAll running applications are listed alphabetically in the Task Manager. Click on Memory in the top right to sort the processes by memory usage.\nTo close a program, right-click on any process and select End task.\nFix 2: Resolve Mod Conflicts Mods are a great way to add new life to an old game, and Minecraft mods are some of the most innovative out there. At the same time, the changes to game data can create conflicts with its normal functioning.\nIf you get the exit code 0 error when playing Minecraft, try running the game after disabling all your mods. If it runs smoothly, add your mods back one at a time until you can replicate the error. This will help you find the problematic mod and uninstall it permanently.\nFix 3: Update the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) Unlike most programming languages, Java programs aren’t compiled directly into machine instructions. Instead, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) translates Java code into actual operating system commands, taking into account the specifics of each platform.\nWhile this makes the Java platform independent, it is also awfully dependent on the JRE itself. As a result, any issues with the JRE can affect the functioning of Java programs, including Minecraft.\nFixing this problem is simple—update the Java Runtime Environment.\nTo download the latest version of JRE, head to the official Java download page maintained by Oracle.\nScroll down to choose a version of JRE to download. Both offline and online installers are available with Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, with additional 64-bit versions where applicable. Download the appropriate setup for your computer.\nRun the setup and accept the license agreement to install Java on your computer.\nThe latest version of JRE should be installed in a few minutes.\nFix 4: Update GPU Drivers Video games are greatly affected by video drivers, making it crucial to keep these updated. The latest VGA driver update often includes a bug fix that eliminates a performance issue.\nThis is why whenever you run into issues with Minecraft or any videogame, updating your video card drivers is a must. You can let Windows find the right driver or, better yet, manually install the latest drivers by downloading them from the manufacturer’s website.\nHead to the device manufacturer’s website to find the latest drivers for your graphic card. If you are using a laptop, this means a laptop manufacturer like Acer, Lenovo, HP, etc. For desktop PCs, go directly to the GPU maker’s site.\nEnter the model number of your laptop (or graphic card) to find the appropriate drivers for your hardware.\nFor a laptop, this gives you an entire list of compatible drivers. Scroll down to find the VGA drivers, often including the name of the GPU as well.\nDownload and run the setup to install the VGA drivers on your computer.\nThe installation package will automatically detect compatibility, giving you the option to upgrade your drivers if everything matches up.\nRestart your PC when the installation is complete for the changes to take effect.\nFix 5: Disable Custom Overlays GPU drivers come with many proprietary tools, including FPS counters and diagnostic overlays. These applications are usually lightweight enough to run quietly in the background, but if you are running into the Minecraft Exit Code: 0 error, you should try disabling these apps.\nWhile names vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, you can find the tool’s icon in the system tray. Click on the upward arrow if no such icon is visible.\nYou can now see any hidden icons. See if you can spot an icon of your GPU brand.\nRight-click on the icon to open its options. On our PC, we have Nvidia Experience running in the background. Select Exit to terminate the application.\nFix 6: Reinstall Minecraft Uninstalling and reinstalling a game is the ultimate fix when things go wrong, as it replaces any corrupted game files and undoes any configuration issues. But Mojang’s Minecraft isn’t like most installed games.\nIt is a Java program, meaning the game isn’t installed on your computer in the first place. It is just a folder containing the game data, which has to be deleted to remove the game.\nDoing the same with the Add or Remove Programs option in the Control Panel will only delete the Minecraft launcher. Before you delete the Minecraft folder, though, you should take a moment to copy the saves folder.\nThe Minecraft folder is stored in a hidden folder within your user directory. You can view it by navigating to “C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Roaming.minecraft,” though you need to be able to view hidden files.\nA better method is to use Run to open the folder directly. Search Run in the Start Menu and enter %appdata%.minecraft.\nWith the game directory open, copy the saves folder to another location, leaving you free to delete the Minecraft folder.\nReinstall the game from the official website.\nWhat is the Best Way to Fix Minecraft “Exit Code:0”? There is no single cause behind the exit code 0 Minecraft error, so there isn’t one way to fix the issue. Your best bet is to close conflicting programs and update the graphic drivers.\nSince Minecraft runs on Java, it is also a good idea to reinstall the Java JRE, updating it to the latest version. Backing up your save files and reinstalling the game is not a bad idea either.\nIt isn’t only running programs that cause conflicts. Mods or FPS counter overlays can also interfere with the game engine, causing an Exit Code: 0 crash. Remove all mods and conflicting programs and see if Minecraft runs normally again.\n","wordCount":"1755","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Meador"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/6-ways-to-fix-minecraft-exit-code-0-617971/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Say Goodbye to Minecraft Exit Code 0: Discover the 6 Foolproof Fixes You Need to Know!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 29, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1755 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michael Meador</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#fix-1-update-your-graphics-drivers>Fix #1: Update Your Graphics Drivers</a></li><li><a href=#fix-2-allocate-more-ram-to-minecraft>Fix #2: Allocate More RAM to Minecraft</a></li><li><a href=#fix-3-disable-mods-or-resource-packs>Fix #3: Disable Mods or Resource Packs</a></li><li><a href=#fix-4-repair-your-minecraft-installation>Fix #4: Repair Your Minecraft Installation</a></li><li><a href=#fix-5-disable-antivirus-software>Fix #5: Disable Antivirus Software</a></li><li><a href=#fix-6-update-java>Fix #6: Update Java</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#fix-1-close-conflicting-programs>Fix 1: Close Conflicting Programs</a></li><li><a href=#fix-2-resolve-mod-conflicts>Fix 2: Resolve Mod Conflicts</a></li><li><a href=#fix-3-update-the-java-runtime-environment-jre>Fix 3: Update the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</a></li><li><a href=#fix-4-update-gpu-drivers>Fix 4: Update GPU Drivers</a></li><li><a href=#fix-5-disable-custom-overlays>Fix 5: Disable Custom Overlays</a></li><li><a href=#fix-6-reinstall-minecraft>Fix 6: Reinstall Minecraft</a></li><li><a href=#what-is-the-best-way-to-fix-minecraft-exit-code0>What is the Best Way to Fix Minecraft “Exit Code:0”?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=say-goodbye-to-minecraft-exit-code-0-discover-the-6-foolproof-fixes-you-need-to-know>Say Goodbye to Minecraft Exit Code 0: Discover the 6 Foolproof Fixes You Need to Know!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#say-goodbye-to-minecraft-exit-code-0-discover-the-6-foolproof-fixes-you-need-to-know>#</a></h1><p>Minecraft is a popular sandbox game, loved by millions of players around the world.

But Mojang’s Minecraft isn’t like most installed games.</p><p>It is a Java program, meaning the game isn’t installed on your computer in the first place. It is just a folder containing the game data, which has to be deleted to remove the game.</p><p>Doing the same with the Add or Remove Programs option in the Control Panel will only delete the Minecraft launcher. Before you delete the Minecraft folder, though, you should take a moment to copy the saves folder.</p><ul><li><p>The Minecraft folder is stored in a hidden folder within your user directory. You can view it by navigating to “C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming.minecraft,” though you need to be able to view hidden files.</p></li><li><p>A better method is to use Run to open the folder directly. Search Run in the Start Menu and enter %appdata%.minecraft.</p></li><li><p>With the game directory open, copy the saves folder to another location, leaving you free to delete the Minecraft folder.</p></li><li><p>Reinstall the game from the official website.</p></li></ul><h2 id=what-is-the-best-way-to-fix-minecraft-exit-code0>What is the Best Way to Fix Minecraft “Exit Code:0”?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-the-best-way-to-fix-minecraft-exit-code0>#</a></h2><p>There is no single cause behind the exit code 0 Minecraft error, so there isn’t one way to fix the issue. Your best bet is to close conflicting programs and update the graphic drivers.</p><p>Since Minecraft runs on Java, it is also a good idea to reinstall the Java JRE, updating it to the latest version. Backing up your save files and reinstalling the game is not a bad idea either.</p><p>It isn’t only running programs that cause conflicts. Mods or FPS counter overlays can also interfere with the game engine, causing an Exit Code: 0 crash. Remove all mods and conflicting programs and see if Minecraft runs normally again.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/how-to-fix-high-ping-ping-spikes-latency-5-quick-tips-1033630/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Say Goodbye to High Ping and Lag with These 5 Quick and Easy Tips!</span></a>
