Many users have reported that Malwarebytes’ memory usage can climb to unacceptably high levels, sometimes even causing their computer to freeze or crash.

Here’s how:\nOpen Malwarebytes and click on Settings in the top right corner.\nIn the General section, scroll down to the Performance section and click on Advanced Settings.\nFind the option for Maximum memory usage and set it to a lower value.
