Well, your imagination is about to become a reality because there is an amazing fridge out there that can do just that. This fridge is designed to make your life easier by doing much more than just keeping your food fresh.\nFirst off, this amazing fridge comes with a built-in camera that allows you to see what’s inside your fridge from anywhere using your smartphone. So, if you’re at the grocery store and you can’t remember what you need, all you have to do is pull up the app and take a look inside your fridge. This feature can also help you keep track of your food inventory, including expiration dates, so you don’t have to worry about wasting food.\nBut that’s not all. This fridge also has a touchscreen display that can be used for a variety of purposes. It allows you to browse recipes, order groceries, play music, and even watch videos while you’re cooking. Plus, it has a built-in voice assistant that can answer questions and provide you with recipe suggestions based on the ingredients you have on hand.\nAnother feature of this amazing fridge is its ability to chill your drinks quickly. If you’ve ever had guests over and realized that your drinks aren’t cold enough, you know how frustrating it can be. But with this fridge, you can activate its ‘super chill’ feature, and your drinks will be ice-cold in no time.\nAnd let’s not forget about its energy-saving capabilities. The fridge is designed to be energy-efficient, which means you can save money on your electricity bill. It also has an eco-friendly mode that you can activate when you’re away from home for an extended period. This mode reduces the fridge’s energy consumption, so you don’t have to worry about wasting energy when you’re not using the fridge.\nIn conclusion, this amazing fridge is a game-changer. It does everything from keeping your food fresh to helping you with cooking and ordering groceries. Whether you’re a busy family or just someone who loves technology, this fridge has something for everyone. So, if you’re looking for a fridge that does more than just store your food, then you’ll be shocked when you see what this amazing fridge can do!\nChosen Solution GE model PFCS1NFYASS Does nothing. Control panel dead. 8/15/19 The light bulb attached to the control panel comes on. That’s it. Nothing on control panel is on.\nNo fans, no cooling nothing. Where do I start? I can use a meter. I am a licensed Electrician but not a electronics technician. I have the tech. data sheet from the bottom of the unit and the parts list from GE. 8/17/19 Here’s my complete trouble shoot. Start with the Name Plate.\nOpened Freezer - Light blinking and or browning out slightly may be a bad connection. Switch seemed fine, bulb good and was tight. Did not go further. Worried about dead Control panel, Tried all Button resets on control panel- no effect. Still dead. Checked harness connector at humidity sensor just behind kick plate on left side. No problem separating connector. Looks the same as “Extra” plug at main control board. (Will get to that later with pic.) Ambient Temperature sensor was hanging down dragging on floor but looked OK. Did not check it. Check for voltage at humidity sensor plug. Here are my readings per wire on female side of connector: yellow to blue .01 to .14 vac blue to red 0.0 to .34 vac red to yellow .008vac to .34vac I started on the DC setting with a max reading of .1 v dc. The voltages were changing so rapidly I thought I might be having some kind of AC or data signal. Switched to AC for all readings. Later found on schematic that the voltage from red to yellow should be 5v dc. Can’t explain the rapidly changing readings. Used Min Max setting on meter. Fluke 12B. The blue wire is listed as common for that sensor. The red and yellow go to terminal plug J5-5 an J5-6 on the Main Control Board (MCB). The blue connects to the dead temperature control panel and to the J4-3 at the MCB. Looked for lack of power to Temp control panel (TCP). No Ice in door board, would be connected to TCP. Could not find Smart trolley, it is also connected to TCP.(what is Smart Trolley?) No LED light transformer or controls as there are no LEDs in unit. No water dispenser controls. Took the TCP apart. Very easy to do. Carefully open the clear plastic bulb cover. Someone broke the plastic hinges off before I got to it. It was taped on where the hinges used to be. It opens at the front and swings down toward the back. There are two 60w appliance bulbs there. The TCP is mounted with 3 long Philips head screws. I lowered the upper shelves to get my screwdriver in. After removing the screws the TCP drops down. There is a harness from the top of the compartment that has 5 wires plus a ground. The black common, red/yellow (should be 12 v dc) and blue common go to the TCP pcb at the front of the panel, the orange and pink wires carry 120v ac to the the bulbs through a fresh food light thermostat. If the bulbs overheat the reflector, the stat kills the power to the bulbs. This all looked great and the bulbs were getting steady 120v ac There seemed to be a very low rapidly changing voltage going to the TCP. I didn’t use the Min Max to capture these voltages. To the back of the unit.\nThe Main Control Board is under a cover on the lower right side of the back of the refrigerator. Remove the screws and the cover comes off. I found no signs of damage, no bad looking Capacitors or resistors. One service note I found was to look at the large resistors under the caps. a burned out resistor here could indicate a bad fan motor. Went to the J4 -2 and J4-3 pins same voltages as in fresh food compartment. Wires probably good, Board Prob. Bad.\nBoards are not cheap. Any way. to repair? The unused plug on the right upper side of the control board may be the smart trolley. I don’t know. It does have three pins and is connected to the same wires. Any thoughts. GE costumer service did not recognize the numbers visible on the PCB stickers. They said they were board manufacturer numbers. They also gave me board model numbers that did not match that big sticker on the back of the machine specifying a special variable speed compressor control board.\nHi, I suggest that you purchase the service manual. I cannot find a free copy of the manual online. You may have better luck Looking what is shown on the Contents page it seems to contain everything that you need to find what the problem may be. It is a small amount to pay to save a lot of hassles.\n","wordCount":"1210","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maria Dunigan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/light-on-nothing-else-works-refrigerator-540536/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You'll be shocked when you see what this amazing fridge can do!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 16, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1210 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Maria Dunigan</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You&rsquo;ll be shocked when you see what this amazing fridge can do!</p><p>Imagine a fridge that does more than just store your food; a fridge that practically does everything for you.
