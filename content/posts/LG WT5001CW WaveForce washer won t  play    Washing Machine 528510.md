Title: Is Your LG WT5001CW Waveforce Washer Refusing to Play Nice? Find Out Why and How to Fix It NOW!

Introduction:
If you own an LG WT5001CW Waveforce washer, you know that it's a high-quality appliance that's built to last. However, no matter how durable it is, it's still prone to wear and tear after years of use. One of the most common problems that LG Waveforce washer owners face is when their machine refuses to play nice. Do you find yourself in this predicament? Do not worry, this article will cover why your LG WT5001CW Waveforce washer may not be playing nice, and how to fix it.

Reasons Why Your LG WT5001CW Waveforce Washer Refuses to Play Nice:
There are a few common reasons why your LG WT5001CW Waveforce washer may refuse to work as expected. They include:

1. Overloaded Washer- If you're cramming too many clothes into the machine, the LG WT5001CW Waveforce washer may refuse to play nice. Overloading the machine continually puts a strain on the motor and other components, eventually leading to issues such as balance problems.

2. Clogged Drain Pump- If the drain pump is clogged, the LG Waveforce washer won't work as expected. This is because the washer cannot perform a wash cycle with standing water in the drum. If you hear the pump humming but no water is draining, the drain pump could be clogged.

3. Unbalanced Load- An unbalanced load in the washing drum is one of the most common reasons why an LG Waveforce washer will not spin. The machine is designed to refuse to spin when the load is unbalanced. If your machine stops and displays an error code during the spin cycle, it could be because the load is unbalanced.

How to Fix Your LG WT5001CW Waveforce Washer:
If you're having trouble with your LG WT5001CW Waveforce washer, there are a few troubleshooting steps you can take before calling a repairman. Some of these include:

1. Handling of the load- Ensure you are not overloading or underloading your LG Waveforce washer. This ensures that the load is balanced.

2. Clean the drain pump- You can remove the drain pump and clean it to ensure it is not clogged. This is usually the problem when the washing machine starts to have drainage problems.

3. Balance the load- If the load is unbalanced, this could cause the machine to refuse to spin. Pause the cycle, add or remove clothes and resume your wash cycle.

Conclusion:
Your LG WT5001CW Waveforce washer is an essential appliance in your home, and when it fails to play nice, it can be frustrating. This article has outlined some of the common reasons why your washer may fail and how to fix it. If you follow these tips and your LG Waveforce washer still doesn't work, do not hesitate to seek assistance from a professional repairman.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a top load WaveForce LG washing machine, model is >WT5001CW. The day it quit, I did a load (incorrectly, but ran through it without showing issue, that we seen.) However, a short time later, when I went to start the next load, it acted like it was powering up, but nothing lit on the display panel. It even still plays the power up melody, as well as the power down melody too, except neither play as loud as they did prior. But that’s it. That’s all I can get out of it. I’ve tried to hold the buttons to do the reset, reset the breaker (knowing it is getting power fine, it does play the melody), but nothing happens beyond the noise when the power button is pressed. Have even tried to just press play to see if it would start, even though all lights where off, and, yeah, no go. & Yes, we purchased this washer used, but we just bought it probably less than six months ago! Really don’t need to seek another. Please, anything you can do to help is appreciated. I had an older Amana Maytag prior, and I was able to repair it fairly easily on my own anytime we had an issue with it. We only replaced it because I really needed a larger drum and it had started leaking.

this could be a main control board issue since you get no response from your washer at all. Here is the SM for your washer LG WT5001CW SM. See if it lets you run the diagnostics cycle by :
·The washer must be empty and the controls must be in the off state.
·Press and hold the WASH / RINSE and SOIL LEVEL buttons; then press the POWER button. The buzzer will
sound twice.
·Press the Start/Pause button to advance to the subsequent test mode step.
