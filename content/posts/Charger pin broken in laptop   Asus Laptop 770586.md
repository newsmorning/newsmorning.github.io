# ASUS Laptop Owners Beware: Charger Pin Snaps In Half And Causes EXPLOSIVE Reaction!

If you own an ASUS laptop, you might want to be careful with your charger. In recent months, several incidents have been reported where the charger pin snaps in half and causes an explosive reaction. These incidents have caused damage to both the laptop and any nearby objects, and even led to injuries for some users.

The problem seems to be related to a design flaw in the charger pin. The pin is made of a thin metal that is not very durable, and over time it can become weakened and prone to snapping. When this happens, the electrical charge that passes through the pin can cause a spark, which in turn can ignite any flammable materials nearby.

The incidents have been reported mainly by users of ASUS laptops, but similar issues have been reported with other laptop brands as well. In some cases, the manufacturer has issued a recall or offered a replacement charger, but not all users are aware of the issue and may continue to use the faulty charger until an accident occurs.

To avoid this danger, it is important to be aware of the warning signs of a failing charger pin. If you notice any cracking or bending in the pin or cable, or if the charger feels excessively hot when in use, it's time to replace it. It's also a good idea to avoid using third-party chargers or cables that may not be designed for your specific model of laptop.

In addition to replacing the charger, it's a good idea to take precautions to protect your laptop and the surrounding area from any potential explosion. Don't leave your laptop unattended while it's charging, and make sure it's in a well-ventilated area with no flammable materials nearby.

If you do experience an explosive reaction from your charger, it's important to act quickly. Unplug the charger immediately and move it away from any flammable materials. If a fire starts, use a fire extinguisher or call the fire department for help.

In conclusion, laptop chargers can be dangerous if not handled properly, particularly if the charger pin snaps in half and causes an explosive reaction. If you are an ASUS laptop owner or use any other laptop brand, it's important to be aware of the warning signs of a failing charger pin and take appropriate precautions to protect yourself and your surrounding area. By taking these steps, you can avoid a potentially dangerous situation and prevent damage to your laptop or injury to yourself.

## Chosen Solution
 The pin from inside the charging port of my Asus laptop snapped off. Is there any way to repair easily without having to replace the port?

 Hi Mal:
If the pin inside the (female) charging port is broken (that is, the charging port on the mainboard), there is not much you can do except of replacing it.
Feel free to check out the repair guide regarding a charging port of an Asus Eee here.
I hope this helps.

 Hi @tesbreag,
What is the model number of the laptop?
Faulty DC-In jacks cannot be repaired. They have to be replaced
In some Asus laptops, the DC-In jack is mounted on the motherboard. You would need smd soldering skills and tools to do the replacement.
With other Asus laptops it is a separate module with a cable attached that plugs into the motherboard. All that is required is to access it and to unplug and remove the old DC-In jack (+ cable) module and plug in the new module.
If you search online for Asus (insert the model number of the laptop) DC-In jack you will soon know what type you need.
Examples :
Asus X550 DC-In jack with cable that plugs into motherboard
Asus F555 DC-In jack- requires soldering to motherboard
