Unlock The Secret To Downloading Anything on Chrome - Learn The 5 Fail-Proof Tricks To Beat Virus Detection!

Downloading files from the internet is a routine task for most of us. Whether it's a new software update or the latest movie, we often rely on our web browsers to download such files. Although Chrome is a reliable browser, sometimes it can be frustrating if it blocks users from downloading certain files, citing virus threats. But what if we told you that there are a few tricks to bypass these restrictions? That's right! You can unlock the secret to downloading anything on Chrome by following the five fail-proof tricks mentioned below.

1. Use A VPN To Outsmart Detection

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are a great way to protect your online privacy, but they can also be used to outsmart Chrome's virus detection. By using a VPN, you can change your IP address and fool Chrome into thinking that you are downloading the file from a different location. This way, even if the file is flagged as a virus, you can still download it without any issues.

2. Change The File Extension

Sometimes, Chrome's virus detection is triggered because of the file's extension. For instance, executable files (.exe) are notorious for being flagged as viruses by Chrome. In such cases, you can change the file extension to something that is not likely to be flagged as a virus. For example, if you're trying to download an executable file, change the extension to ".txt" or ".doc." This trick should help you bypass Chrome's virus detection.

3. Disable Your Antivirus Software

Antivirus programs are designed to detect and prevent virus infections. However, sometimes they can be overly aggressive and flag legitimate files as viruses. If you're having trouble downloading a file, try temporarily disabling your antivirus software and then retry the download. This trick works because Chrome's virus detection relies on the antivirus software's feedback. So, if the antivirus program is not running, Chrome will not detect any viruses.

4. Use A Different Browser

If all else fails, you can simply switch to a different browser. Although Chrome has a high market share, there are plenty of other browsers available that you can use to download files. Some of these browsers might not have the same virus detection mechanism as Chrome, allowing you to download files that were being blocked before.

5. Turn Off Chrome's Virus Scanner

If you're confident that the file you're trying to download is safe, you can turn off Chrome's virus scanner altogether. To do this, go to Chrome's "Settings," scroll down to "Privacy and Security," and then click on "Security." Here, you will find an option to "Enable Chrome's malware scanner." Turn this off and retry the download.

In conclusion, Chrome's virus detection can be a pain, but it's there to protect you. However, if you're trying to download a file that you know is safe, you can use these five fail-proof tricks to bypass Chrome's restrictions. Whether you choose to use a VPN, change the file extension, or disable your antivirus software, the key takeaway is that there's always a way to download what you need. Happy downloading!

We download files frequently, but many users reported failed virus detected in Chrome when downloading certain files.
 
## Find out all you need about Download Failed Virus Detected
 
- The Failed virus detected error from Chrome is in fact a problem with your current antivirus.
 - You can still try to bypass this issue by using a better, more reliable browser.
 - A great solution is to unblock the browser and restore the quarantined files.

 
- Easy migration: use the Opera assistant to transfer exiting data, such as bookmarks, passwords, etc.
 - Optimize resource usage: your RAM memory is used more efficiently than Chrome does
 - Enhanced privacy: free and unlimited VPN integrated
 - No ads: built-in Ad Blocker speeds up loading of pages and protects against data-mining

Usually, you won’t be able to download or access a recently downloaded package if an antivirus program will detect a malicious file that might represent a security breach for your Windows 10 device.
 
So, you don’t have to blame Google Chrome but your own antivirus software as it is the one showing the Failed: virus detected alert message.
 
Anyway, if you know for sure that the implied file is 100% secured and that you are receiving a false positive from your antivirus, you can fix this issue in order to resume the initial download operation.
 
Of course, by applying the troubleshooting steps from below you can also return and use Google Chrome without receiving further security alerts and fix the Download failed: virus detected.
 
One more time, apply the guidelines below only if you know for sure that the files which will be downloaded aren’t representing any security risks for your Windows 10 system.
 
This isn’t the only security issue that users reported, and we already wrote on how to secure your certificate if Chrome says it’s not valid.
 
## Why does my download say failed Virus detected?
 
Chrome has its own malware detection system that protects users from threats. If the software determines that the file is unsafe, it will prevent the download and give you this message.
 
In some instances, it’s possible that your antivirus is blocking the download, so you might have to adjust a couple of settings to fix that.
 
If you’re getting Failed virus detected in Chrome, you can bypass that by using the solutions from this guide.
 
### How do I scan Chrome for malware?
 
- Click the Menu button in the top right corner and choose Settings.
 - In the left pane, navigate to Reset and clean up.
 - Click on Clean up computer.
 - Wait for the scan to finish and remove any malicious extensions of software if it’s found.

 
##  How do I get past failed virus detection?
 
- Switch to a browser with built-in security features
 - Scan for PUP using a dedicated tool
 - Unblock Chrome and restore quarantined files
 - Disable Windows Defender
 - Turn off Chrome Safe Browsing

 
### 1. Switch to a browser with built-in security features
 
Instead of trying to fix the virus alert on Google’s browser, how about trying an alternative browser that is rather similar but has far more security tools integrated.
 
We’re talking about the tool recommended below which is, at the moment, one of the most secure browsers out there.
 
Even though you’ll still need an antivirus for local system protection, rest assured that your browsing experience won’t be tainted by any malicious software, adware, pop-ups, or browser hijackers.
 
Along with the built-in troubleshooter, this browser also brings the built-in VPN which is above the competitive solutions, and a variety of privacy-focused features.
 
So, if you want to keep your PC safe while browsing anonymously, check the download link below and give it a go.
 
### 2. Scan for PUP using a dedicated tool
 
No matter how many security extensions you install on chrome, they cannot compare with a full-fledged antivirus tool. 
 
###  Opera 
 
  Enjoy safe and secure browsing with Opera’s built-in ad-blocker and VPN with unlimited bandwidth.  
 
To make sure there’s no hidden, rogue extension that downloads something without your confirmation, we suggest checking for PUPs.
 
A PUP, as opposed to cute puppies, is a significantly hastier and a possible threat to your computer.
 
Also known as junkware, this is an add-on or a software wrapper that you most likely did not want to have installed on your computer. A software wrapper is a third-party tool that downloads the product you choose, while also installing some extras, such as toolbars or adware.
 
Changes to your web browser’s homepage and search settings may also be made by those extras. 
 
But don’t worry, you can get rid of it right away using specialized software. To make your job easier, we’ve compiled a list of the easiest and most reliable PUP removal programs to ensure that the task is done properly. 
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

To give you a glimpse of what you will find in our list above, ESET Internet Security is one of the specialized tools. 
 
Before software is installed on your computer, ESET may detect potentially unwanted, harmful, and suspicious extra add-ons attached to it. 
 
### 3. Unblock Chrome and restore quarantined files
 
### 
 
You will most probably resolve this failed virus in Chrome issue by allowing the downloaded files from Windows Defender settings like in the example below.
 
1. Open Windows Security on your computer.
 

 
2. From the main window click on Protection history.
 
3. Locate the application that has been blocked on the list and expand it.
 
4. Expand the Actions menu and click on Allow.
 
Now, for making sure that this file won’t get detected as potentially malicious software, you can add a particular exclusion within Windows Defender, and that should help with the virus scan failed message in Chrome.
 
Or, and we recommend you do this, you can permanently disable Windows Defender.
 
Of course, afterward, you must choose to install a new security program in order to keep everything safe and secure all the time.
 
But this time choose a better security solution that gets daily updates and which can properly identify the files that are dangerous for your computer.
 
### 4. Disable Windows Defender

 - There, type gpedit.msc and press Enter.
 - From Local Group Policy click on Computer Configuration, then extend Administrative Templates and go to Windows Components; finally, access Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
 - From the main panel double-click on Turn off Windows Defender.
 - For disabling Windows Defender choose Enabled from the window that will be displayed on your computer.
 - Apply and save your changes.
 - Reboot your Windows 10 system in the end.

 
#### 4.2 Disable Windows Defender from System Settings
