Title: Is Your 2012-2016 Scion FR-S Trying to Tell You Something? Caution: Check Out These Crucial ABS Traction and Brake Light Warning Signs!

Introduction:

The Scion FR-S is a sports car designed and manufactured by Toyota from 2012 to 2016. It is one of the most popular and sought-after models in the sports car category. However, like any other car, it may show certain warning signs that should not be ignored by the driver. In this article, we will talk about the important warning signs related to ABS traction and brake lights that indicate a problem with your FR-S.

ABS Traction Light Warning:

The ABS traction light, displayed on your dashboard as a symbol of a car with wavy lines underneath, is one of the most important warning signs related to your car's safety. When this light appears, it means that your car's ABS traction control system is malfunctioning or not working correctly.

The purpose of ABS traction control is to prevent the wheels from slipping or locking up during hard braking or driving on slippery surfaces. It does this by controlling the brakes on each wheel independently, allowing the wheels to maintain traction with the road.

If the ABS traction light stays on, it can be due to several reasons such as a faulty sensor, a broken wire, a damaged module, or a malfunctioning ABS pump. The best course of action is to take your car to a certified mechanic who will diagnose and repair the problem.

Brake Light Warning:

The brake light warning is a red symbol of an exclamation mark inside a circle, displayed on your dashboard. When this light appears, it indicates that there may be a problem with your car's braking system, and you should take immediate action to avoid any safety hazards.

The braking system is vital to your car's safety, and any malfunction can lead to serious accidents. The brake light warning can be a result of various factors such as low brake fluid level, worn brake pads, damaged brake lines, or a malfunctioning braking system.

To prevent any potential risks, you should take your car to a qualified mechanic who will inspect and repair the issue. It is crucial not to ignore this warning sign as it could lead to more significant problems if left unattended.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, your Scion FR-S's ABS traction and brake lights are crucial indicators of your car's safety. If you notice any warning signs related to these lights, do not ignore them. Instead, take your car to a certified mechanic to diagnose and repair the issue. Remember, a small issue can escalate into a bigger problem if not fixed promptly. So, take care of your FR-S, and it will take care of you on the road!

 i took it to Miata Toyota they said is the abs relay                                                           i changed the abs pump but still the same lights on                                                        help please!

 Over time, the relay contacts become carbon-ed up. You can either change the relay with a new one or cut the top off carefully and pinch a thin business card between the contacts and draw it through there until no black trace comes out onto the card. Do not use abrasive paper or a file. I believe the relay is located separately from the pump, so changing the pump won't fix the relay issue. I used to repair ABS modules ... they blow the earth track internally as a very common problem; an easy fix. Failing that, it can be the ABS computer, but I'm assuming they checked there was a good signal to the relay first.
