You’re going about your day, using your trusty iPhone 8, when suddenly it stops responding. You try everything you can think of to revive it, but nothing works. And just as you’re about to give up hope, the unthinkable happens – your iPhone 8 comes back to life! But there’s a catch – you can’t see or touch it.\nBody: That’s exactly what happened to me recently, and I have to admit, I was pretty freaked out at first. One minute, my iPhone 8 was working as normal, and the next, the screen went blank and it stopped responding to my touch. I tried all the usual tricks – restarting it, plugging it in to charge, and even resetting it to its factory settings. But nothing seemed to work.\nJust when I thought all was lost, however, my iPhone 8 suddenly sprang back to life. But there was one major problem – the screen remained black, and I couldn’t interact with it in any way. I could hear text messages coming in and phone calls ringing, but I couldn’t respond to them. It was like my iPhone 8 had come back to life, but only in a ghostly, ethereal form that I couldn’t actually access.\nAfter doing some research online, I discovered that this somewhat bizarre phenomenon has actually happened to other iPhone users in the past. It’s apparently caused by a glitch in the iOS software that causes the iPhone to become trapped in DFU mode, which stands for “Device Firmware Upgrade.” Essentially, this mode is meant to help users upgrade their iPhone’s firmware, but if the iPhone becomes stuck in it, it can cause all sorts of problems.\nFortunately, there are some ways to fix this problem. The first thing to try is to put the iPhone into recovery mode and then restore it with iTunes. This process essentially wipes the iPhone clean and installs a new version of the iOS operating system, which should hopefully fix the problem. Another option is to use a third-party tool specifically designed to fix DFU problems.\nConclusion: In the end, I was able to fix my iPhone 8 by restoring it with iTunes. It was a bit of a hassle, but I was relieved to have my trusty iPhone back in working order. The experience did make me realize just how much we rely on our smartphones these days, and how lost we can feel without them. But it also reminded me that there are a whole host of online resources available to help us troubleshoot our phones when things go awry. So, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation, don’t panic – chances are, there’s a solution out there that can bring your smartphone back to life.\nChosen Solution I dropped my phone few hours ago while i was walking on the pedestrians street.it accidentally slipped from my hand.The protection film was badly cracked, but after i peeled it off, the screen was fine.I could hear and feel the buzz when someone calls me, but i cant see, or touch the screen.In the internet, people are saying that the inside of the LCD screen’s the one that’s broken, but it costs a lot, and i also do not have the apple care too…I already tried to click the home and lock button together, and it’s COMPLETELY dead.P.s. it was charged 100% by my portable charger.PLZ respond!!\nPut a new screen on it.
