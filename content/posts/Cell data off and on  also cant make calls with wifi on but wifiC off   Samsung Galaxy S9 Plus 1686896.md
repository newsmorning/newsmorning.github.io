Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus: The Cell Data Dilemma You Must Know About - Switching On and Off Can Save Your Phone!

Are you using a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and struggling with a high cell phone bill? Do you often wonder why your phone data balance is depleting fast even though you haven't been using your phone excessively? You are not alone, as many Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus users are facing the same dilemma. The good news is that there is a simple solution, and all you need to do is switch your cell data on and off.

Before we dive into how switching on and off your cell data can save your phone, let's first understand the problem. The Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus has a feature that allows apps to run in the background, even when you are not actively using them. Some of these apps require an internet connection to function, and as a result, they keep using cellular data without your knowledge. These apps could range from social media platforms to news apps and even games.

The consequence of these background apps using cellular data is that your data balance keeps depleting fast, and if unchecked, can lead to a high phone bill. What's worse is that you might not even be aware of which app is using your data, leaving you helpless in managing your digital consumption.

Now, let's move on to the solution to this problem â€“ switching on and off your cell data. By disabling cell data, you are cutting off the internet connection to all your apps, and in turn, preventing them from using your cellular data. This feature is especially helpful when you are not using your phone or when you are in a location where the network connection is unstable.

To switch off cell data on your Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, follow these simple steps:

1. Swipe down from the top of the screen to access the notification panel.
2. Tap the "Mobile data" icon to switch off your cell data.
3. To switch on your cell data, simply tap the "Mobile data" icon again.

By taking this small step, you can save yourself from a hefty phone bill and manage your cell data consumption effectively. It is essential to note that cutting off cell data means that you will not receive any notifications from apps that require an internet connection, so make sure you switch on your cell data periodically to check for new updates.

In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus is an excellent phone with many features, but it comes with a cell data dilemma that can strain your pocket. By switching on and off your cell data, you can save yourself from this problem and enjoy your phone experience without worrying about excessive data usage. So, don't hesitate to switch off your cell data when you don't need it, your pocket will thank you!

## Chosen Solution
 Recently replaced the screen in my s9+ but for some reason the cell data has been shotty, one minute it works and the next it doesnt. But with an iphone on the same carrier the data is completely fine with wifi off. Why would it work off and on?

Not only that but if I have wifi and wifi calling on it works fine, but with wifi on and wifi calling off it doesnt!

 It sounds like you didn't connect one of the antennas when you put it back together.
