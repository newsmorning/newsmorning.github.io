# Macbook Pro Owners Beware: Green Charger Light Flashing But Your Device Won't Turn On? Discover The Shocking Reason Why!

As a proud Macbook Pro owner, you rely heavily on your device to get through the day. Whether it’s for work, entertainment or communication, your Macbook Pro is an important part of your daily routine. So, when your green charger light starts flashing but your device won’t turn on, it can be a frustrating and confusing experience. But, before you panic and start googling “Macbook Pro won’t turn on”, take a deep breath and read on to discover the shocking reason why.

The Problem: Green Charger Light Flashing But Device Won’t Turn On

We’ve all been there - you plug in your charger to your Macbook Pro and the green light starts flashing, indicating that your device is charging. But, when you try to turn on your Macbook Pro, it refuses to cooperate. You press the power button but nothing happens. You try a hard reset by holding down the power button for 10 seconds but your device remains unresponsive. You start to panic and wonder if this is the end of your trusty Macbook Pro.

The Solution: The MagSafe Charger May Be At Fault

Before you give up on your Macbook Pro, it’s important to identify the root of the problem. In most cases, the green charger light flashing but the device not turning on is caused by a faulty MagSafe charger. The MagSafe charger is an essential component for charging your Macbook Pro, but sometimes it can malfunction, causing your device to not turn on even when the charger is plugged in.

So, what should you do if you suspect your MagSafe charger is at fault? Firstly, check the connection between the charger and your Macbook Pro. Sometimes, the charger may not be properly connected, or the cable may be damaged, causing a disruption in the charging process. If the connection looks fine, try resetting the SMC (System Management Controller) on your device. This can be done by pressing Shift + Control + Option + Power Button for 10 seconds. Then, release the buttons and try turning on your device again.

If these steps don’t work, and you continue to experience the same problem, it may be time to invest in a new MagSafe charger. You can purchase a replacement charger from Apple or authorized resellers. It’s important to note that using third-party chargers may not be safe, and could damage your device.

In Conclusion

Dealing with a Macbook Pro that won’t turn on can be a stressful and frustrating experience, but before you give up hope, it’s important to troubleshoot the problem. In most cases, a flashing green charger light but an unresponsive device is caused by a faulty MagSafe charger. By checking the connection, resetting the SMC and investing in a new charger if necessary, you can get your device up and running in no time. Remember, always use official Apple products and authorized resellers to ensure the safety and longevity of your Macbook Pro.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi everyone, new to this forum.
I managed to get a MacBook Pro 15” Retina Mid 2015 for dirt cheap. It will be delivered somewhere this week. It’s missing a charger and the SSD. I already have a charger which I can use. The MacBook is the i7 2.2GHZ with Intel Iris graphics by the way.
The previous owner told me the laptop has a big issue: it’s not turning on anymore. One of his kids broke the keyboard (by pulling keys out, lol) so he tried replacing it. After replacing it with a new keyboard, the MacBook wouldn’t turn on anymore. That’s why he listed it for sale. When he is plugging in the charger, the charger light is green.
I know buying this is quite the gamble, as there can probably a lot off issues that can cause this. I don’t mind: for me this is just a learning experience.
I’m wondering what my first steps would be when I get this MacBook delivered. I’m thinking about trying these things:
See if I can hear/see the fans runSMC resetPRAM resetI can try to hook it up to an external displayI can try to disconnect the battery and then try to turn it on with the charger connected
Does this make sense? Any other thing I can try? This would be my first MacBook repair.
Oh and do I need an SSD already to test if I can get it to power on? Or can I first try without and buy/install it as soon as I confirm it works again?
Thanks a lot! Kind regards,
Jeroen

 Using an Apple USB keyboard maybe needed here if the keyboard is messed up. Having a external drive which is setup as a bootable running macOS Sierra would be useful USB or Thunderbolt.
For now with no drive using the either the internal or external keyboard see if you can get into the onboard diagnostics using the D key at startup.
Reference: Mac startup key combinations
To setup a bootable drive download the OS installer from here How to get old versions of macOS and follow this guide How to create a bootable macOS Sierra installer drive You only need a 32 MB USB thumb drive which is first formatted with GUID and a Journaled file system.
Let us know how it goes.
