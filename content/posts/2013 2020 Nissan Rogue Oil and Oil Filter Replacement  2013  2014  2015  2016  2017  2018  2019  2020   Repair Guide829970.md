# Save Hundreds of Dollars on Car Maintenance with This Simple Nissan Rogue Oil Replacement Guide!

If you're a proud owner of a Nissan Rogue, then you probably know that regular oil changes are key to ensuring that your car runs smoothly and lasts longer. However, trips to the mechanic every few months can quickly add up in terms of cost. Here's where learning to change your own oil can save you hundreds of dollars in maintenance fees!

Before you get started, here are some essential items you'll need:

1. A funnel
2. An oil filter wrench
3. A container for used oil
4. New oil (check your owner's manual for the right type and amount)
5. A new oil filter (again, check the manual for the correct one)

Once you have all of these items, follow these simple steps:

Step 1: Get your car ready
Before you start, make sure your car is on a level surface and that the engine is cold. You can also pop the hood and loosen the oil cap.

Step 2: Get under the car
Using your oil filter wrench, remove the oil filter. Be sure to have a container ready to catch any oil that may spill.

Step 3: Drain the oil
Locate the oil drain plug on the bottom of the engine and loosen it with a wrench. Again, have your container ready to catch all the used oil.

Step 4: Replace the oil filter
Dip your finger into some fresh oil and use it to lubricate the gasket on your new oil filter. Then, screw it into the engine by hand until it's snug. You can use your oil filter wrench to give it an extra half turn or so.

Step 5: Add fresh oil
Use a funnel to pour the fresh oil into the engine. Refer to your owner's manual for the correct amount of oil to use.

Step 6: Check the oil level
After adding the new oil, check the oil level using the dipstick. You may need to add more oil if the level is too low.

Step 7: Clean up
Dispose of used oil and oil filter properly. Double check everything is tight, and clean up any oil spills.

And that's it! Changing the oil in your Nissan Rogue is a straightforward and relatively easy task that can save you time and money in the long run.

With regular oil changes, your Nissan Rogue will continue to run smoothly and efficiently, and you'll avoid costly repairs down the line. By using this simple oil replacement guide, you'll become a pro at changing your own oil in no time!

## Introduction
 
Working under a vehicle can be very dangerous if you fail to take proper precautions. Follow all instructions carefully, and do not attempt to take shortcuts or "make do" with missing or poorly maintained equipment. If you're not sure how to proceed, get some help from a more experienced fixer.
 
AT NO POINT during this procedure should you get underneath the vehicle when it's supported only by a jack. Make sure the vehicle rests securely on jack stands before getting underneath it.
 
You can also follow this guide to safely raise your vehicle with ramps rather than with a hydraulic jack.
 
## What you need
 
## 

Step 1

                  Oil and Oil Filter Replacement               


 
- 
 - On a flat, level surface, position the jack behind the front driver-side wheel so that it pushes the car up by the metal frame.
 - 
 - Place wheel chocks behind the front passenger-side wheel and the rear drive-side wheel.
 - 
 - Lift the car enough for you to be able to safely fit underneath it then fit the jack stand underneath it.
 - 
 - Place the jack stand next to where the jack is placed, and extend the jack stand so that it is right under the frame.
 - 
 - Gently lower the car so that it is resting all of its weight on the jack stand.
 - 
 - Keep the car jack positioned right under the frame as a back-up.
 - 
 - Do not get under the car if there is any other person or pet in the vehicle as this can cause the vehicle to fall, leading to serious injury or death.
 - 
 - For more information on how to lift the car with a jack and use jack stands follow this guide.
