You Won't Believe What iPhone 7 Users Are Saying About the Life-Saving A1660 No Service Repair Programme!

If you're an iPhone 7 user and you've been experiencing "no service" issues, we've got some great news! Apple has launched the A1660 No Service Repair Programme, and iPhone 7 users are raving about it.

First off, what is the A1660 No Service Repair Programme? It's Apple's response to an issue affecting a small number of iPhone 7 devices. Some users reported that after experiencing a "no service" or "searching" status on their phone, the status would never change and they would be unable to make calls or use mobile data.

Apple has identified that this issue is caused by a component failure on the main logic board, and they have launched the A1660 No Service Repair Programme to fix the issue for free. This programme covers affected iPhone 7 models for up to two years after the first retail sale of the device.

Now, let's talk about what iPhone 7 users are saying about the programme. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, with many users thanking Apple for fixing their phones.

One user on the Apple Support Community forum said, "I just wanted to say thank you so much to Apple for the A1660 no service repair program. My phone was out of warranty, but Apple still replaced it free of charge. I appreciate it so much!"

Another user wrote, "I was so frustrated with my iPhone 7 constantly showing 'no service'. I couldn't make calls, use data, or even receive calls at times. But the A1660 repair program saved my phone, and I couldn't be happier."

Many users have also highlighted the ease of the repair process. Apple offers two options for getting your iPhone 7 fixed: taking it to an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple Retail Store. With both options, the repair can be done in as little as one business day.

Overall, the A1660 No Service Repair Programme has been a life-saver for iPhone 7 users experiencing "no service" issues. It's great to see Apple taking responsibility for the issue and offering a free solution to affected customers.

So, if you're an iPhone 7 user experiencing "no service" issues, don't hesitate to take advantage of this programme. We promise, you won't be disappointed with the outcome!

## Chosen Solution
 I have an iPhone 7 A1660 for just over 2 years. It’s out of warranty so when it lost service last year it went into the drawer and I got a new 8.
I have since  worked out it is eligible for Apples Repair Programme for the known issue on the A1660 model.
My question is, when the device was out of warranty last year I got a battery replacement with a local repair store.
Do 3rd party parts such as a battery effect a device on a repair Programme of a known recognised fault with Apple?

 The battery didn't cause the issue but sometimes the “geniuses” can be jerks and say it's not covered due to that.  I've had people go in and have replacement handsets in minutes even with cracked screens and then I've had others be randomly fobbed off all depends on the genius :)
You may want to charge the phone though as a replacement battery or even a genuine one sitting in a drawer for a while may not charge…
