Here Are 5 Proven Ways to Fix it for Video, Maps and YouTube!\nFirefox is a popular web browser used by millions of people worldwide. It’s fast, user-friendly, and offers several features that make it stand out from its competitors. However, Firefox black screen issues can be a frustration for many users. If you’ve been experiencing black screen problems while using Firefox, then it’s time to solve the issue.\nHere are five proven ways to fix black screen problems in Firefox:\nDisable Hardware Acceleration: Hardware acceleration is a feature that enhances the performance of your browser by delegating various tasks to your computer’s GPU. However, this feature could be the culprit behind your black screen issues. Disabling hardware acceleration is an effective way to solve the problem. To do this, follow the steps below:\nStep 1: Click on the three horizontal lines at the upper-right corner of the Firefox toolbar.\nStep 2: Click on ‘Options.’\nStep 3: Select the ‘General’ tab.\nStep 4: Scroll down to the ‘Performance’ section.\nStep 5: Uncheck the ‘Use recommended performance settings’ option.\nStep 6: Uncheck ‘Use hardware acceleration when available’ box.\nStep 7: Restart Firefox and see if the problem is solved.\nDisable Plugins: Some plugins installed in Firefox may be causing black screen issues. To disable plugins, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Click on the three-horizontal lines at the upper-right corner of the Firefox toolbar.\nStep 2: Click on ‘Add-ons.’\nStep 3: Select the ‘Plugins’ tab.\nStep 4: Click on ‘Never Activate’ for each plugin.\nStep 5: Restart Firefox to see if the issue is fixed.\nClear Cache and Cookies: Over time, Firefox accumulates temporary data, such as cache and cookies, that can cause the browser to malfunction. Clearing the cache and cookies can resolve black screen problems. To do this, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Click on the three-horizontal lines at the upper-right corner of the Firefox toolbar.\nStep 2: Click on ‘Options.’\nStep 3: Select the ‘Privacy \u0026 Security’ tab.\nStep 4: Under ‘Cookies and Site Data,’ click on ‘Clear Data.’\nStep 5: Check the ‘Cookies and Site Data’ and ‘Cached Web Content’ options.\nStep 6: Click on ‘Clear.’\nStep 7: Restart Firefox.\nCheck for Browser Updates: Outdated browser versions can cause black screen problems. Ensure your browser is up-to-date by following these steps:\nStep 1: Click on the three-horizontal lines at the upper-right corner of the Firefox toolbar.\nStep 2: Click on ‘Help.’\nStep 3: Select ‘About Firefox.’\nStep 4: Firefox will automatically check for updates, and if available, install them.\nStep 5: Restart Firefox to apply the updates.\nDisable Firewalls: Some firewalls may interfere with the functioning of Firefox, causing black screen issues. To temporarily disable your firewall, use the following steps:\nStep 1: Press the Windows key and R at the same time.\nStep 2: Type in firewall.cpl in the dialog box that appears.\nStep 3: Select ‘Turn Windows Firewall on or off.’\nStep 4: Check the ‘Turn off Windows Firewall’ box for both ‘Private network settings’ and ‘Public network settings.’\nStep 5: Click ‘OK.’\nStep 6: Check if the black screen issue is resolved.\nIn conclusion, with these five proven methods, you should be able to fix black screen problems in Firefox for video, maps, and YouTub, and other streaming services. If none of these steps resolve your problem, consider contacting Firefox support for further assistance. Remember that Firefox is always improving its browser functionality and updating frequently, so staying on top of upgrades can also help you maintain a seamless browsing experience.\nAmong the many problems people have with their browsing experiences is the Firefox screen suddenly turning black or blank.\nYou can fix Firefox blank page issue by disabling certain settings Firefox has a long history, but many users reported Firefox black screen issues on their PC, so today we’ll try to fix that.\nIf Firefox is experiencing issues, you can always switch to a different browser and move your browsing data to it.\nOne way to fix this issue is to remove any software that might interfere with Firefox.\nEasy migration: use the Opera assistant to transfer exiting Firefox data, in just a few steps\nOptimize resource usage: your RAM memory is used more efficiently than Firefox does\nEnhanced privacy: free and unlimited VPN integrated\nNo ads: built-in Ad Blocker speeds up loading of pages and protects against data-mining\nDownload Opera\nThe problem happens with most browsers, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Internet Explorer included. But it appears it’s with Mozilla Firefox users that the problem causes most frustrations.\nOften, this error happens without warning, and while you are already logged into Firefox. It happens randomly and for varying lengths of time.\nA black screen will also log you out of all the web pages, and in more severe cases, you won’t be able to use Firefox at all.\nWhy did my Firefox background turn black? Judging from the reports sent by those who have encountered this problem, there could be several causes for it.\nSome only started facing the problem after installing a new driver, extension, antivirus, or other forms of software.\nOthers say they started noticing the issue after they upgraded the OS. Yet there are also quite a few who don’t recall installing any new software prior to this problem popping up.\nThere are a few fixes you could try to resolve the Firefox black screen video problem from within the browser. But what if you can’t even access the browser?\nSo we would start with those fixes that do not need you to be logged into the browser. And then we’ll move on to other solutions.\nHow do I fix the black screen on Firefox? 1. Switch temporarily to another browser If you’re experiencing a black screen on Mozilla Firefox, perhaps this is the right time to switch to a different browser.\nSo why not try out a browser that comes with less to zero error messages such as Opera?\nDownloading Opera takes only a couple of minutes, and settings it up is extremely easy. Besides, you can switch from your default browser to Opera in only a few steps.\nNamely, after downloading it, in the Settings area, you can find a Synchronization option that allows you to import bookmarks, pages, and other data from your default browser.\nFurther on, you can customize the browser by adding icons, sidebars, workspaces, and bookmarks for ease of access and a better-organized workflow.\n2. Scan your computer for viruses Whenever your computer starts to misbehave, your first suspicion is usually a virus attack. Unfortunately, these have become quite common and everyone, especially those who work online, is at risk.\nOpera Take your browsing experience to the next level with this error-free and highly customizable browser.\nAnother common source of viruses is external devices, like memory sticks and external hard drives, that you connect to the computer. Before you consider the other fixes, you should perhaps first scan your computer for viruses.\nOn this note, we recommend using a powerful third-party antivirus to perform an in-depth scan. Please make sure that you run a reliable and up-to-date antivirus utility.\nIt is very important to have a security tool that keeps track of all cyber threats because new risks arise on a daily basis. We recommend you look for an antivirus that comes with multi-layered protection.\nIf you secure your system with more than just one type of shield, the chances of detecting and blocking threats grow significantly.\nAdditionally, make sure that your antivirus comes with a powerful firewall and a straightforward privacy policy.\nFor the most part, antiviruses are built to protect your identity and browsing data, but it is important to check and know for sure that that’s the case.\nSome PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.\nExpert tip:\nSPONSORED\nPerform a full system scan and see the results. If your AV found any threat, make sure to quarantine or remove it. After you get rid of the intruder, check to see if the error persists.\n3. Uninstall recent software Press Windows + R to launch Run, enter appwiz.cpl in the text field, and click on OK. Now, select the problematic program from the list, and click Uninstall. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. If the Firefox black screen flash problem starts to occur after you have recently installed a new piece of software on your Windows computer, there is a big chance that software could be interfering with your Firefox browser.\nIn fact, randomly installing third-party software has many risks for your computer. And if you have installed more than one such software, you may want to make a list of these and uninstall them one by one.\nIdeally, you will want to uninstall them, starting with the one you installed immediately before you started encountering this problem.\nAn instance where this quick fix has been proven to work is where people started facing this problem after recently updating their graphics driver. The problem was fixed by simply undoing the update and reverting to the previous version.\nFor a more efficient result in terms of removing programs, we suggest using a dedicated uninstaller tool. Removing with the help of Windows settings will most likely leave behind some leftover files.\nThese will not only take up memory space for no reason, but they may also interfere with the functionality of your PC. Uninstallers can detect and safely remove all these types of files.\nOn top of that, in case the problem is caused by a malicious app, dedicated uninstallers are the way to go as well. They can force-uninstall apps that you won’t be able to remove otherwise.\nSo, if you earlier came across Firefox black screen when playing video, uninstalling conflicting apps should do the trick.\n4. Disable hardware acceleration within Firefox Launch Firefox, paste the following path in the address bar, and hit Enter:about:preferences#general Scroll down to Performance, first uncheck Use recommended performance settings, and then the Use hardware acceleration when available option under it. This solution works if the Firefox turned black and remains inaccessible.\nHardware acceleration is meant to improve your browser’s performance by enabling the hardware to take over functions that the software on your PC isn’t able to execute as efficiently.\nBut it tends to clash with some graphics processors and drivers, which can cause this black screen problem to occur.\nAfter disabling the feature as shown, check if the Firefox blank screen problem is fixed.\n5. Start Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode Launch Firefox, click on the hamburger icon near the top-right, and select Help. Now, click on Troubleshoot Mode. Click Restart on the confirmation prompt. Finally, click Open in the dialog box that appears. Go ahead and check if the problem still comes up. Starting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode might work because a potential cause of the problem could be an extension you recently added to your browser.\nBy default, starting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode temporarily disables all extensions, installed themes, and custom settings on your browser. This is also a good way of temporarily disabling the hardware acceleration feature mentioned before.\nHow do I fix Google Maps’ black screen in Firefox? If you are getting a black screen when opening Google Maps in Firefox, it could be a problem with the extensions or cache. First, press Ctrl + Shift + R to reload the page and bypass the existing cache.\nIf that doesn’t work, look through the extensions installed on Firefox, and disable the non-critical ones. Also, clearing the browsing data has helped fix the problem for many users.\nHopefully, one of the possible fixes discussed here has helped you solve the Firefox black screen problem in Windows 10/11.\nAlso, find out what to do if the problem is not limited to Firefox, but you are seeing a black screen on Windows.\nIf you have suggestions or even other solutions, share them with us using the comments section below.\nBlack screen issues Email *\nCommenting as .

Scan your computer for viruses<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-scan-your-computer-for-viruses>#</a></h3><p>Whenever your computer starts to misbehave, your first suspicion is usually a virus attack. Unfortunately, these have become quite common and everyone, especially those who work online, is at risk.</p><h3 id=opera>Opera<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#opera>#</a></h3><p>Take your browsing experience to the next level with this error-free and highly customizable browser.</p><p>Another common source of viruses is external devices, like memory sticks and external hard drives, that you connect to the computer. Before you consider the other fixes, you should perhaps first scan your computer for viruses.</p><p>On this note, we recommend using a powerful third-party antivirus to perform an in-depth scan. Please make sure that you run a reliable and up-to-date antivirus utility.</p><p>It is very important to have a security tool that keeps track of all cyber threats because new risks arise on a daily basis. We recommend you look for an antivirus that comes with multi-layered protection.</p><p>If you secure your system with more than just one type of shield, the chances of detecting and blocking threats grow significantly.</p><p>Additionally, make sure that your antivirus comes with a powerful firewall and a straightforward privacy policy.</p><p>For the most part, antiviruses are built to protect your identity and browsing data, but it is important to check and know for sure that that’s the case.</p><p>Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.</p><p>Expert tip:</p><p>SPONSORED</p><p>Perform a full system scan and see the results. If your AV found any threat, make sure to quarantine or remove it. After you get rid of the intruder, check to see if the error persists.</p><h3 id=3-uninstall-recent-software>3. Uninstall recent software<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-uninstall-recent-software>#</a></h3><ul><li>Press Windows + R to launch Run, enter appwiz.cpl in the text field, and click on OK.</li><li>Now, select the problematic program from the list, and click Uninstall.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.</li></ul><p>If the Firefox black screen flash problem starts to occur after you have recently installed a new piece of software on your Windows computer, there is a big chance that software could be interfering with your Firefox browser.</p><p>In fact, randomly installing third-party software has many risks for your computer. And if you have installed more than one such software, you may want to make a list of these and uninstall them one by one.</p><p>Ideally, you will want to uninstall them, starting with the one you installed immediately before you started encountering this problem.</p><p>An instance where this quick fix has been proven to work is where people started facing this problem after recently updating their graphics driver. The problem was fixed by simply undoing the update and reverting to the previous version.</p><p>For a more efficient result in terms of removing programs, we suggest using a dedicated uninstaller tool. Removing with the help of Windows settings will most likely leave behind some leftover files.</p><p>These will not only take up memory space for no reason, but they may also interfere with the functionality of your PC. Uninstallers can detect and safely remove all these types of files.</p><p>On top of that, in case the problem is caused by a malicious app, dedicated uninstallers are the way to go as well. They can force-uninstall apps that you won’t be able to remove otherwise.</p><p>So, if you earlier came across Firefox black screen when playing video, uninstalling conflicting apps should do the trick.</p><h3 id=4-disable-hardware-acceleration-within-firefox>4. Disable hardware acceleration within Firefox<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-disable-hardware-acceleration-within-firefox>#</a></h3><ul><li>Launch Firefox, paste the following path in the address bar, and hit Enter:about:preferences#general</li><li>Scroll down to Performance, first uncheck Use recommended performance settings, and then the Use hardware acceleration when available option under it.</li></ul><p>This solution works if the Firefox turned black and remains inaccessible.</p><p>Hardware acceleration is meant to improve your browser’s performance by enabling the hardware to take over functions that the software on your PC isn’t able to execute as efficiently.</p><p>But it tends to clash with some graphics processors and drivers, which can cause this black screen problem to occur.</p><p>After disabling the feature as shown, check if the Firefox blank screen problem is fixed.</p><h3 id=5-start-firefox-in-troubleshoot-mode>5. Start Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-start-firefox-in-troubleshoot-mode>#</a></h3><ul><li>Launch Firefox, click on the hamburger icon near the top-right, and select Help.</li><li>Now, click on Troubleshoot Mode.</li><li>Click Restart on the confirmation prompt.</li><li>Finally, click Open in the dialog box that appears.</li><li>Go ahead and check if the problem still comes up.</li></ul><p>Starting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode might work because a potential cause of the problem could be an extension you recently added to your browser.</p><p>By default, starting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode temporarily disables all extensions, installed themes, and custom settings on your browser. This is also a good way of temporarily disabling the hardware acceleration feature mentioned before.</p><h3 id=how-do-i-fix-google-maps-black-screen-in-firefox>How do I fix Google Maps’ black screen in Firefox?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-i-fix-google-maps-black-screen-in-firefox>#</a></h3><p>If you are getting a black screen when opening Google Maps in Firefox, it could be a problem with the extensions or cache. First, press Ctrl + Shift + R to reload the page and bypass the existing cache.</p><p>If that doesn’t work, look through the extensions installed on Firefox, and disable the non-critical ones. Also, clearing the browsing data has helped fix the problem for many users.</p><p>Hopefully, one of the possible fixes discussed here has helped you solve the Firefox black screen problem in Windows 10/11.</p><p>Also, find out what to do if the problem is not limited to Firefox, but you are seeing a black screen on Windows.</p><p>If you have suggestions or even other solutions, share them with us using the comments section below.</p><ul><li>Black screen issues</li></ul><p>Email *</p><p>Commenting as .
