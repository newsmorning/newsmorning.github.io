Is Your LG TV Acting Up? Learn How to Fix the Mysterious Black Screen and Flickering Issues NOW!

LG TVs are known for their exceptional picture quality and sound, making them a popular choice among consumers. However, like any other electronic device, LG TVs can also experience various technical issues, including black screens and flickering problems, which can be frustrating for users. If you're an LG TV owner experiencing these issues, this article will guide you on troubleshooting steps to fix the problem.

Black Screen Issue

The black screen issue is a common problem experienced by LG TV users and can occur due to various reasons, including signal problems, input problems, or issues with the TV's hardware. The following are steps to take to diagnose and fix the black screen issue on your LG TV.

Step 1: Check the Power Connection

Start by checking if the TV is properly connected to power. Ensure that the power outlet is working correctly and that the TV's power cord is securely plugged into the outlet. If the TV is connected to a surge protector, make sure it is turned on.

Step 2: Check the Input Connection

Another reason for a black screen issue is an incorrect input source. Ensure that the TV is set to the correct input source, either HDMI or AV, depending on the device connected to the TV.

Step 3: Reset the TV

If the above steps do not solve the black screen issue, try resetting the TV's software. Press the “Home” button on the remote control, select “Settings,” then “General.” Choose “Reset to Initial Settings,” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Be sure to restart the TV after the reset.

Step 4: Call the LG Customer Service Center

If the issue persists after completing the above steps, contact LG's customer service center for assistance. The issue may be due to a hardware issue that requires repair or replacement.

Flickering Issue

The flickering issue is another prevalent issue LG TV users experience. It can occur due to various reasons such as picture settings, signal issues, or power problems. The following are steps to diagnose and fix the flickering issue on LG TVs.

Step 1: Check the Picture Settings

The flickering issue can occur if your TV's picture settings are incorrect. Ensure that your TV's picture settings are set to "Standard" for the best viewing experience. Additionally, turn off the "TruMotion" or "MotionFlow" option to prevent flickering during fast-moving scenes.

Step 2: Check the HDMI cables

Flickering issues can also be due to bad HDMI cables. Try switching to another HDMI cable to check if the flickering issue resolves.

Step 3: Check the Power Connection

Ensure that your TV's power connection is secure and that the TV is correctly connected to a power source.

Step 4: Contact LG Customer Service Center

If the flickering issue persists after attempting the above steps, contact LG's customer service center for further assistance. The issue may be due to hardware problems that require professional repair.

Conclusion

In conclusion, LG TVs can experience black screen and flickering issues due to various reasons. However, many of these issues can be fixed using the troubleshooting steps outlined in this article. If you're still experiencing issues after trying out the above steps, it's recommended that you contact LG's customer service center or a professional repair service.

## Chosen Solution
 Usually it will work for a while until it goes black with  the said flickering on top. Sound works and the image for a random amount of time. Any tip to fix it/ broken component(s)?
The first image its the tv working normally, the second when it goes black and the third an odd angle of the back of the tv.
FYI the image got better as I played around with the tv, before there were a lot of colored stripes and the image quality was awfull.

 First: There are no pictures posted for this.  Post them if you can.
Second:  There are a number of reasons for a black screen.  What is needed though, is whether or not there is still a picture on the screen when it goes black.  Hold a flashlight close to the screen and see whether or not there is an image.  Report the results here.
Since this happens on a random basis, it can indicate a failing component or even a bad connection somewhere.  Open up the back and remove and reattach each cable.  Sometimes this can resolve the problem.  Take a few pictures of the boards and post them here as well.  We may be able to identify a component that is failing from the picture.
Start with the re-seating of the cables and the flashlight test and update this.  We will continue from there.
