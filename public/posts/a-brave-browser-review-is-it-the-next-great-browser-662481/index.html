Our In-Depth Review Has the Surprising Answer…\nThe internet is a vast and ever-evolving space that requires a reliable and efficient browser to navigate. With so many internet browsers available, it can be difficult to decide which one to use. Brave Browser is a new browser that promises to change the game when it comes to surfing the web. In this in-depth review, we will explore the features of Brave Browser and determine if it is the game-changing browser we have all been waiting for.\nWhat is Brave Browser?\nBrave Browser is a free and open-source web browser developed by Brave Software, Inc. This browser was built with privacy and security in mind, making it a popular choice among users who want to browse the web with confidence. Brave Browser uses blockchain technology to ensure that user data is secure and private.\nFeatures of Brave Browser\nAd-Blocking: Brave Browser blocks all intrusive ads on websites, making browsing the web faster and more efficient. In addition, Brave Browser offers a feature called Brave Rewards, which allows users to earn cryptocurrency by viewing ads.\nPrivacy-Highlighting: Brave Browser shows you how much time and data you save by using its ad-blocker. It also offers advanced privacy features such as fingerprinting protection, which prevents websites from tracking your online activity.\nTor-Integration: Brave Browser offers Tor integration, allowing users to browse the web anonymously.\nCryptocurrency Wallet: Brave Browser has a built-in cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to earn, manage, and store cryptocurrency. This feature is beneficial for users who want to earn passive income while browsing the web.\nOur Review of Brave Browser\nBrave Browser is a game-changer when it comes to browsing the web. It offers advanced privacy and security features that are not available in other web browsers. The ad-blocking feature is efficient, and the Brave Rewards program is a unique way of earning cryptocurrency by browsing the web.\nThe Tor-integration makes browsing the web anonymously possible, and the cryptocurrency wallet is a great added feature for users who want to earn digital currency. Brave Browser’s user interface is easy to use and navigate, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and advanced users.\nHowever, Brave Browser is not without its downsides. Some users may find the ad-blocking feature too aggressive, and some websites may not function properly with Brave Browser’s aggressive ad-blocking feature. Also, the cryptocurrency wallet is still in early development and may not be suitable for users who require a more advanced cryptocurrency wallet.\nFinal Verdict: Is Brave Browser the Game-Changing Browser We’ve All Been Waiting for?\nIn conclusion, Brave Browser offers advanced privacy and security features that make browsing the web safer and more efficient. The ad-blocking feature and Brave Rewards program are excellent and unique features that set Brave Browser apart from other web browsers. However, Brave Browser is not without its downsides. If you are looking for a web browser that prioritizes security and privacy, then Brave Browser is the game-changing browser you have been waiting for.\nBrave Browser is a free and open-source browser from Brave Software Inc. released in 2016 and built on top of the Chromium web browser that Google’s own Chrome is based on. Brave was created by the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of the Mozilla Project, Brendan Eich, responsible for today’s Firefox.\nThough more or less a standard browser, the Brave browser continues to gain popularity. It’s a free browser that allows users to browse, display online content, run web apps and, similar to current offerings, Brave will remember site authentication information.\nThe Brave browser has been viewed as the next Google Chrome and appears to be the solution to challenges that are seen in regular browsers. In this article, we’re going to explore those claims and provide a general overview of what you can expect from this intriguing new browser.\nA Brave Browser Review: Is It The Next Great Browser? When in the market for a web browser that focuses on speed and security, the typical big names, such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, simply will not do. Google Chrome is the most popular browser the world over, but that’s just because people are generally unaware of the better alternatives.\nThe Brave browser has an intuitive and clutter-free user interface with all of the elements one can expect in an ideal browser. It displays blocked content statistics on the home page which can be very useful to those wishing to track that sort of thing. You’ll also find clickable shortcuts to your most visited pages, the current time, photos, and a tracker for your Brave Rewards.\nBrave Rewards System Brave has positioned itself as the faster loading browser with better privacy protection than the bulk of its competitors. A core feature of Brave is that it blocks ads by default. Something that originally created quite a stir as many viewed this as a serious threat to content creators. However, this is not entirely the case.\nThe truth is that some Brave browser users can support content creators even more through the use of the browser. Brave takes a unique approach to content creator compensation. Rewards are accumulated through the Brave Ads network and donations provided by users.Publishers, prior to qualifying for revenue, are required to register with the network and they will earn 55% of the replaced ad revenue.\nBrave allows users to support their favorite websites through the use of Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) cryptocurrency. The browser comes with a built-in, loadable wallet for your BAT with the option to allocate a specified amount to whichever sites you wish to support. Users can set a monthly budget that will automatically be distributed to frequently visited sites.\nAnyone who uses the Brave browser can earn revenue in BAT by browsing websites that are a part of their publishers program. A user must first activate their BAT wallet and then consent to having standard adverts replaced with anonymous ads from Brave. That user will be paid in BAT at 15% of the total revenue. The amount is determined by how you spend your time on Brave.\nPrivacy \u0026 Security Being a privacy focused browser, Brave can be considered far safer than Chrome and Firefox. Not only does is block ads by default, but also trackers and blocking scripts. Brave does everything it can to shield your PC, Laptop or mobile phone against malware \u0026 other malicious scripts.\nThe basic browsing process, though safer than the flagship browser its built on, is still a small step in the right direction. Brave, in an attempt to make their browser even more secure, offers you the ability to open a private window using The Onion Router (TOR).\nWhat this means is that when using the feature, your online browsing history is hidden even from your internet service provider on top of your IP address being hidden from every site you visit. Brave will never collect, store, or sell any of your personal data as your data is considered your own personal property as detailed in Brave’s terms of service.\nSomething important to note is that all of Brave’s security features are enabled by default upon installing the browser for use. This means that there is no reason to edit anything if your chief concern is security. However, if you need additional details or are a computer guru and would like to add a few things to the code in order to create your own version of Brave, the entire open-source project can be found on Github.\nDefault Ad Blocker We’ve already mentioned that the Brave browser blocks ads automatically. This means that uBlock, AdBlocker+, and other ad blocker programs are not necessary when using Brave. The auto-blocking feature protects your device from malware and extensive tracking by advertisers. Brave will only block third-party cookies by default. All first-party cookies remain enabled but Brave provides users with the option to prevent or enable cookies on any given website.\nAd tracking is very accurate through Brave as users are provided with ads appropriate to your local data. All irrelevant ads are removed from view to avoid the annoyance that they generally provide. The data itself is confined to the device used while browsing as there are absolutely zero third-parties capable of storing data involved with Brave.\nThe only ads not blocked by Brave are those displayed in search results. This means that you will be able to see AdWords advertisements within Google’s, or any search engine you’ve chosen to use, results. This happens because ad blocking extensions are unable to prevent search ads.\nImproved Browser Privacy The default ad blocker automatically makes for a safer browsing experience. Since Brave does not have access to identifiable user data, this data cannot be traced back to a user’s device. The incorporation of permanent HTTPS allows for encryption to be used everywhere when available while browsing. Mobile Brave users will find the fingerprinting feature, activatable in Settings, bars third parties from tracking your activity.\nThough it is not as secure as Tor browser, compared to popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and even Edge, the Brave browser runs smoother while maintaining a more secure approach to a user’s privacy.\nFaster Than The Competition The lack of third-party ads attributes to the faster browsing speed Brave holds over its competition. With less content to download on both the front and backend, zipping around the web has never been faster. However, this is only true of page loading speeds. When it comes to image and video rendering, Chrome and Firefox still hold a slight edge.\nBrave Browser Extensions and Features As Brave is set up on the Chromium platform it would be fair to assume that your Chrome extensions will still work on the browser. Your assumptions would be correct. Almost all Chrome extensions can be added through the Chrome Web Store for use on Brave. This makes it easier to import all of your favorite extensions you’re already using when swapping over to the better browser.\nTwitter Tipping One of the most recent feature additions to the Brave browser is the ability to tip users on Twitter. In a single click you can move revenue from your BAT wallet into a content creator’s. You’ll notice a BAT icon accompanied by the word ‘TIP’ located at the lower-right of the tweet.\nClick the icon, select the amount from the new window, and confirm.\nThe tip will tag you in a follow-up tweet letting the content creator know how much and where it came from.\nDark Mode These days a Dark Mode comes standard on most platforms. The Brave browser is no different in this regard. The damage white light can do to your eyes over time is more than enough reason to enable this mode.\nTo enable it, navigate to brave://settings/In the left side menu select Appearance.\nIn the main window, you can choose between Dark, Light and Same as Windows.\nThis particular feature as of this writing is unavailable on Android and iOS. The Brave team is working on it and it will likely be available sometime in 2020.\nThe Verdict So, is the Brave browser the next great browser? A rundown on the positives are as follows:\nFaster than other top-named web browsers.You will save data on your mobile plan with less ads to render which is more money in your pocket.On that same note, you will save time not having to load ads.Earn BAT revenue just by browsing.Privacy is the primary focus. This is just a short list on what Brave provides. Is it the best? That isn’t for us to say. We would suggest downloading and installing Brave so that you can test out the features and make a final decision for yourself.\n","wordCount":"1971","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nathan Harmon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/a-brave-browser-review-is-it-the-next-great-browser-662481/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Is Brave Browser the Game-Changing Browser We've All Been Waiting for?

You’ll notice a BAT icon accompanied by the word ‘TIP’ located at the lower-right of the tweet.</p><p>Click the icon, select the amount from the new window, and confirm.</p><p>The tip will tag you in a follow-up tweet letting the content creator know how much and where it came from.</p><h4 id=dark-mode>Dark Mode<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dark-mode>#</a></h4><p>These days a Dark Mode comes standard on most platforms. The Brave browser is no different in this regard. The damage white light can do to your eyes over time is more than enough reason to enable this mode.</p><ul><li><p>To enable it, navigate to brave://settings/In the left side menu select Appearance.</p></li><li><p>In the main window, you can choose between Dark, Light and Same as Windows.</p></li></ul><p>This particular feature as of this writing is unavailable on Android and iOS. The Brave team is working on it and it will likely be available sometime in 2020.</p><h2 id=the-verdict>The Verdict<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-verdict>#</a></h2><p>So, is the Brave browser the next great browser?
