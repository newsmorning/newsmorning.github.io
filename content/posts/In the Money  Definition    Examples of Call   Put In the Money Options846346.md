# Discover the Surprising Truth About In the Money Options - Examples of Call and Put That Will Leave You Speechless!

Are you looking to invest in stocks or other assets? If so, you may have heard of in the money options. However, do you know what they really are and how they work?

In this article, we'll explore in the money options in detail, including their definition, how they differ from out of the money options, and examples of both call and put trades that will leave you speechless. So, let's get started.

## What are In the Money Options?

In the money options (ITM) are call or put options that have intrinsic value. More specifically, an ITM call option is one whose strike price is less than the current market price of the underlying asset, while an ITM put option is one whose strike price is higher than the current market price of the underlying asset.

To put it simply, ITM options have already made money and thus have intrinsic value. For instance, if the current price of a stock is $100, and you're holding a call option with a strike price of $90, then your option is already in the money because it has intrinsic value of $10. The opposite is also true for holding an ITM put option.

## How do In the Money Options differ from Out of the Money Options?

While in the money options have intrinsic value, out of the money options (OTM) do not. Instead, OTM options have only time value, and thus their value is solely based on the potential that the underlying asset may increase in value.

Moreover, ITM options are generally more expensive than OTM options because they have intrinsic value. The closer the option's strike price is to the current market price of the underlying asset, the higher the option's intrinsic value and the higher its price. As for OTM options, they are less expensive because they only have time value.

## Examples of In the Money Options

Now that we've defined ITM options and how they differ from OTM options, let's take a look at some examples of ITM options.

### The Call Option Example

Assume you buy a call option with a strike price of $50 for shares of XYZ, which are currently trading at $60 per share. The premium is $3 per share, so the total premium paid is $300 (100 shares x $3).

Let's say that the market price of XYZ increases to $70 per share. Now, your option is in the money because the strike price ($50) is lower than the market price ($70). Consequently, you have two options: sell the option or exercise it.

If you choose to sell it, you will make a profit determined by subtracting the premium from the difference between the strike price and the market price. Specifically, in this example, you would make a profit of $2,000 [(($70 - $50) - $3) x 100]. Alternatively, you could exercise the option, which means you would buy 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share and then sell them for $70 per share for a profit of $2,000 minus the premium paid.

### The Put Option Example

Let's now look at an example of an ITM put option. Assume you buy a put option with a strike price of $50 for shares of XYZ when they are trading at $40 per share. The premium is $3 per share, so the total premium paid is $300 (100 shares x $3).

At some point, the market price of XYZ drops to $30 per share. Now, your option is in the money because the strike price ($50) is higher than the market price ($30). You then have two options: sell the option or exercise it.

If you choose to sell the option, you will make a profit determined by subtracting the premium from the difference between the strike price and the market price. Specifically, in this example, you would make a profit of $2,000 [(($50 - $30) - $3) x 100]. Alternatively, you could exercise the option, which means you would sell 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share and then buy them for $30 per share for a profit of $2,000 minus the premium paid.

## Conclusion

In the money options can be great investment tools, but you need to carefully evaluate the risks and rewards. Understanding how options work and the difference between ITM and OTM options is crucial. Ultimately, you may want to consult a broker or financial advisor to help you make sound investment decisions with ITM options.

Thus, the exercise price is a term used in the derivative market.read more of the underlying asset is more than the market price.
 
- An option may be ‘At the money,’ which means the strike price equals the market price. The holder of this option is at a break-even levelBreak-even LevelBreak-even analysis refers to the identifying of the point where the revenue of the company starts exceeding its total cost i.e., the point when the project or company under consideration will start generating the profits by the way of studying the relationship between the revenue of the company, its fixed cost, and the variable cost.read more, meaning they would make no profit or loss if the option is exercised.An option may also be ‘Out of the money,’ meaning that the holder of the option would incur a loss if exercised.

 
In a nutshell, an option may be ‘In the money,’ ‘Out of the money,’ or ‘At the moneyAt The MoneyATM refers to a situation in which the option holder's exercise of the option results in no loss or gain since the exercise price or strike price is equal to the current spot price of the underlying security. read more‘ depending on the relationship between the underlying asset’s current market price and the option’s strike price.

### Example
 
#### #1 – Call Option
 
Let us consider that you buy a call option on Apple Inc. at $ 200, which gives you the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying assetUnderlying AssetUnderlying assets are the actual financial assets on which the financial derivatives rely. Thus, any change in the value of a derivative reflects the price fluctuation of its underlying asset. Such assets comprise stocks, commodities, market indices, bonds, currencies and interest rates.read more. The underlying asset, Apple Inc.’s stock, is currently being traded in the market at $203. So, this option is said to be in the money as you can buy the stocks of Apple Inc. at $3 less than the market price.
 
This is the opposite for put optionsPut OptionsPut Option is a financial instrument that gives the buyer the right to sell the option anytime before the date of contract expiration at a pre-specified price called strike price. It protects the underlying asset from any downfall of the underlying asset anticipated.read more.
 
#### #2 – Put Option
 
Now, you buy a put option on Apple Inc. at $200, which gives you the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset. A put option will be profitable or be in the money if the market value of the shares of Apple Inc. falls below $200. Because you can buy the shares from the market at a much cheaper rate than the rate you have agreed to sell them. If the underlying asset’s value falls to $197, you can buy the shares from the market at $197 and exercise the put option at $200, giving you a $3 profit.
 
### Deep In the Money
 
An option that would lead to a large profit if exercised is called ‘Deep in the Money.’ This is a new term used by options traders for options with a higher delta, 0.75 and above, to be precise. Delta is the change in the price of an asset (the option) to the corresponding change in the price of its underlying asset. The delta value for an option may be positive or negative depending on the option, whether call or put.
 
For example, if an option has a delta of 0.75, if the price of the underlying asset increases by $1 per share, everything else being equal, the option’s value will increase by $0.75 per share.
 
### Advantages
 
- In the Money, Option has a higher delta value than at the money option or an Out of the money option, which means that this option would give a higher return than an At the money option or an Out of the money option would give with the same move on the underlying asset or stock.The biggest advantage of having this type of option is that it has a lower risk than an At money option or an Out of money option. This is because the underlying asset would have intrinsic value at the time of expiration even if the value of the underlying stays unchanging, unlike an Out of money option, which would result in a complete loss.The holder of this type of option will always benefit from exercising the option. Since the option has an intrinsic value, it is always worth exercising.

 
- The money option consists of intrinsic value, and the per contract value would be more than an At money option or an Out of money option. This makes an ITM contract more costly than an At money or an Out of the money option.The percentage gain on an ITM option is lesser than what would be gained on the same move for an At money option or an Out of money option. Although there is a profit in such an option, the percentage gain is much higher when an option is At the Money or Out of the moneyOut Of The Money”Out of the money” is the term used in options trading & can be described as an option contract that has no intrinsic value if exercised today. In simple terms, such options trade below the value of an underlying asset and therefore, only have time value.read more.

 
### Conclusion
 
- A call option will have an intrinsic value if the strike price is below the market price.If the strike price is above the market price, a put option will have an intrinsic value.This option results in the profit of the holder of the option.The strike price is fixed, whereas the underlying asset price is based on the market.The price of the underlying asset will always keep on changing according to the market conditions.An in-the-money option can move to either an At money option or an Out of money option due to the change in the price of the underlying assets since it is always dependent on the market conditions.Deep In money options refer to the options which would result in a huge profit if exercised.Such options have an intrinsic value, and exercising them will give a profit to the holder of the option.
