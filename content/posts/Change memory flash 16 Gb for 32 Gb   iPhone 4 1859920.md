One of the biggest drawbacks of the iPhone 4 is its limited storage capacity. But with a simple upgrade, you can increase your phone's memory to 32GB, giving you plenty of space for all your apps, photos, and music.

Here's what you'll need:

Step 1: Power down your phone and remove the back cover

Use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the two screws at the bottom of your iPhone 4. Then use the plastic pry tool to gently pop off the back cover.

Step 2: Remove the old motherboard

Use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the four screws holding the motherboard in place. Carefully disconnect the ribbon cables and lift the motherboard out of the phone.

Step 3: Replace the motherboard with the new one

Take the new back cover with 32GB flash memory and align the new motherboard with the phone's connectors. Carefully screw in the four screws to secure the motherboard in place.

Step 4: Reattach the back cover

Line up the back cover and use the Phillips screwdriver to reattach the two screws at the bottom of the phone.

Step 5: Power on your phone and enjoy the extra storage!

 I have an iPhone 3GS 32 Gb and iPhone 4 16 Gb, it's possible change the flash memory 16 Gb in iPhone 4 for 32 Gb from my iPhone 3GS???
Thanks!!!

 In a word, no.  The pinout is the same, but the solder points are inaccessible. If you have an automated solder rework station, something like that found here: http://www.apolloseiko.com/ then yes, you can do it.
In all likelihood, all you will accomplish is breaking two phones to try to save $100

 No. The NAND Flash are hardwired onto the logic board. Unless you have access to reflow equipment and resolder IC's there is no way you can get it accomplished.

 Yes, you can use any storage size iPhone 3GS screen to fix any iPhone 3GS. This is true of all models. The storage capacity of the phone has no effect on screen compatibility. Make sure everything else is the same, but you don't need to sweat the storage.

 First you have to remember with Apple devices like iPhones the the processor and flash memory are paired. However their are you was around it 1st take a phone were the processor and flash memory work ie the logic board had otherwise been damaged 2nd if you know all the spec of the processor their are some company's  that will program the flash memory with the processor information then the processor and memory are paired. You are limited by the capility ie if your devices max size is 128gb then that is the max memory size you can install. You can buy the machine that will  program the flash memory but bit expensive.
This is a project that should only be done good at taking the device apart and putting back together again and the use of heat gun to remove the heat shields and chips.
In the end is it worth it
