With Dark Mode, you can reduce the amount of blue light emitted by your device’s screen, which can disrupt your sleep cycle, and enjoy a sleek and stylish browsing experience.\nHowever, enabling Dark Mode on Opera GX is just the first step - there’s much more you can do to customize this feature to your liking. In this article, we’ll show you five simple but effective tricks to unleash the night with Dark Mode on Opera GX and make your favorite websites truly unforgettable.\n1.

However, you can force Dark Mode on every website you visit by using a neat little trick.\nFirst, go to the Settings menu by clicking on the three dots on the top-right corner of the browser window. Then, select Appearance and scroll down to the Force Dark Mode for Web Contents option. Turn it on, and voila - every website you visit will now have a dark background and light texts by default, unless they explicitly forbid it. This trick can be a lifesaver for those who like to browse lesser-known websites or their own personal blogs, which may not have a Dark Mode option.\n2. Customize Dark Mode Colors While Dark Mode on Opera GX looks great on its own, you may want to tweak its colors to your liking. Fortunately, Opera GX allows you to change the color schemes of Dark Mode easily.\nTo do this, go back to Settings \u003e Appearance and scroll down to the Customize Your Theme option. Here, you can choose from several preset color schemes, such as “Midnight Purple” or “Neon Green,” or create your own by adjusting the hue, saturation, and brightness of the background, foreground, and accent colors. You can even import color schemes created by the Opera GX community or export your own for others to use.\n3. Adjust Dark Mode Contrast Depending on your device’s screen and lighting conditions, Dark Mode on Opera GX may not be as easy to read as you’d like.

Here, you can slide the bar left or right to decrease or increase the difference between the background and the text. You can also test your contrast settings on a sample text before applying them to the entire browser.\n4. Schedule Dark Mode If you don’t want to manually turn on or off Dark Mode every time you browse the web, you can set a schedule to do it for you automatically.\nIn Settings \u003e Appearance, scroll down to the Scheduled Themes option and turn on the Enable Scheduled Themes toggle. Then, click Add Schedule and select the days and times you want Dark Mode to be enabled or disabled. You can set different schedules for individual days or groups of days, such as weekends or working days. This feature can be helpful for people who switch between day and night shifts or have irregular sleep patterns.\n5. Use Sidebar Shortcuts Finally, you can access and toggle Dark Mode on Opera GX even faster by using the sidebar shortcuts.\nPress the F4 key or click the GX Corner icon on the left-hand side of the browser window to open the sidebar. From there, you can click the Dark Mode toggle to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode, as well as use other handy shortcuts such as opening the Task Manager, controlling the music player, or checking the network connection.
