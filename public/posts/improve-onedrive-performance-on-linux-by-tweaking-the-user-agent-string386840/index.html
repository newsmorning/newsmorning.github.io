Do you feel frustrated with the sluggish performance of Onedrive on Linux? If yes, then you have come to the right place!\nIn this article, we will show you a simple hack that will revolutionize your Onedrive experience on Linux and boost its performance in seconds.\nFirst, let’s understand the problem. Onedrive is designed to work smoothly on Windows, but it faces several challenges while running on Linux. One of these challenges is the limited bandwidth allocated to the Onedrive app on Linux. This limited bandwidth leads to slow syncing of files and folders, which is frustrating for Linux users who rely on Onedrive for storing and syncing their important data.\nTo solve this problem, we need to tweak the Onedrive settings on Linux. And the best way to do this is by using a tool called “Rclone.” Rclone is a command-line tool that acts as a bridge between Onedrive and Linux. This tool enables us to change the Onedrive settings to allocate more bandwidth to the app, resulting in faster syncing of files and folders.\nBut first, we need to install Rclone on our Linux system. Here’s how to do it:\nStep 1: Open the terminal on your Linux system and type the following command:\nsudo apt-get update\nThis command will update the system.\nStep 2: After updating the system, type the following command to install Rclone:\nsudo apt-get install rclone\nThis command will install Rclone on your Linux system.\nNow that we have installed Rclone, we can proceed with changing the Onedrive settings to allocate more bandwidth to the app. Here’s how to do it:\nStep 1: Open the terminal on your Linux system and type the following command:\nrclone config\nThis command will configure Rclone.\nStep 2: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up Rclone for Onedrive.\nStep 3: After setting up Rclone, go to the Onedrive settings page on your web browser.\nStep 4: In the Onedrive settings, go to the “Network” tab.\nStep 5: In the “Network” tab, change the “Upload rate” and “Download rate” values to your preferred value. We recommend setting these values to the maximum possible bandwidth of your internet connection.\nStep 6: Save the Onedrive settings and close the web browser.\nStep 7: Open the terminal on your Linux system and type the following command:\nrclone sync This command will sync your local directory with the Onedrive remote directory.\nThat’s it! With these simple steps, you can revolutionize your Onedrive experience on Linux and boost its performance in seconds.\nConclusion:\nOnedrive is an essential tool for Linux users who need to store and sync their important data. However, its sluggish performance on Linux can be frustrating. By using the simple hack we have shown you in this article, you can overcome this problem and enjoy fast syncing of your files and folders on Onedrive. With Rclone, you can customize the Onedrive settings to allocate more bandwidth to the app and enjoy a smooth syncing experience on Linux. So go ahead and try out this hack today!\nA user agent is a web browser software that sends information about your browser and operating system to the websites that you’re visiting. The websites then use this information to customize content for the capabilities of your computer.\nDownload DriverFix (verified download file).\nClick Start Scan to find all problematic drivers.\nClick Update Drivers to get new versions and avoid system malfunctionings.\nDriverFix has been downloaded by 0 readers this month.\nIn other words, each and every person who connects to the Internet has a unique user agent. To put it differently, this software acts as the bridge between users and the mighty Internet. The data it transmits to the websites that you’re visiting are very important for web developers. This data allows them to customize the user experience.\nAfter this short introduction, let us get into the main body of this article. Many Linux users have reported that their OneDrive experience lets a lot to be desired. According to their reports, Office 365 OneDrive is slow and loading takes an awful lot of time.\nFortunately, one resourceful user has come up with an interesting solution to improve OneDrive’s performance on Linux.\nHow to boost OneDrive’s performance on Linux 1. Download a dedicated browser extension to change the user-agent string. Depending on your browser, you can download and install the Modify Headers extension for Mozilla Firefox, the Modify Headers Google Chrome extension, and so on.\nChange the OS in the user agent string by replacing Linux with a Windows OS version. OneDrive should now work faster. Here’s how the user who came up with this solution describes the process:\nThe slow OneDrive performance on Linux is indeed an annoying bug. Microsoft really needs to improve its feature detection using user agent strings.\nFor a few weeks I have Linux Mint 18.1 installed on my laptop. […] With that project we use onedrive on a Office 365 platform. On my laptop I use the latest Firefox 52 browser and strictly work in Word online since document compatibilty is always an issue[…] Sadly enough I experienced a lot of performance issues while browsing the directory and working on a document.[…]\nThen I began thinking and trying a few different things. On of the first ideas I came up with was changing the user-agent string. I changed the user-agent string to the following: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52\nI used the following extension in Firefox to change it. After changing the user-agent the performance problems were resolved. The UI of OneDrive worked flawlessly. The only thing in the user-agent that changed was the OS. At first I thought this was a random occurrence but no. I changed back to the normal user-agent and the problem came back.\nMany Linux users would be tempted to say that Microsoft put this limitation into place in order to frustrate and degrade the user base that has moved to Linux. However, this is not the case. If you set your user agent to IE 7 on Windows XP, you’ll be redirected to an error page inviting you to upgrade your browser. This shows that Microsoft cannot properly detect your user agent.\nFor more information about OneDrive’s performance on Linux, check out this Reddit thread.\nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:\nRead Apple and Linux file systems on Windows with this tool Use Fedora 25 to switch from Windows to Linux How to install Linux Bash on Windows 10 version 1607 If the advices above haven’t solved your issue, your PC may experience deeper Windows problems.
