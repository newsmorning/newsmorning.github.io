Is Your Outlook Inbox Stuck? Discover 5 Surprising Hacks to Get Your Messages Flowing Again!

If you are like most people today, you rely on emails as a primary form of communication. Whether it's for work, personal, or school, we all have an email account that we check regularly. One of the most popular email clients is Outlook, a part of Microsoft's Office Suite. However, sometimes, even the best of us get stuck with a bloated or unresponsive inbox that can be challenging to fix. Here are five surprising hacks to get your messages flowing again:

1. Clean up your inbox
One of the most common reasons for a stuck Outlook inbox is a lack of organization. If your inbox has too many unread messages or is cluttered with spam or unnecessary emails, it may decrease its performance. To combat this, start by organizing your inbox with folders, marking important emails as read, and then deleting the rest.

2. Disable Add-ins
Outlook has many add-ins designed to make life easier, but sometimes they can interfere with the functionality of the program. Add-ins also consume system resources, which can slow down the performance of your inbox. To get your messages flowing again, try disabling some or all of your add-ins.

3. Compact your mailbox
Over time, Outlook's mailbox may become bloated as attachments, and other files accumulate. This problem can be solved by compacting your mailbox. Typically, this process involves archiving older emails, removing duplicate emails, and compressing the mailbox. You can do this by accessing the Mailbox Cleanup option in the File menu.

4. Reduce the size of your attachments
Sending large attachments can severely affect your email performance. Outlook may even freeze temporarily while trying to send or receive large attachments. The best way to avoid this is to compress or reduce the size of your attachments. You can use compression software like WinZip or 7-zip to accomplish this.

5. Repair corrupt PST file
Outlook stores all emails, contacts, and other data in a file called a PST (Personal Storage Table). This file can become corrupt or damaged, leading to a stuck inbox. To repair a corrupt PST file, open the Inbox Repair Tool located in the Microsoft Office Tools folder. Follow the prompts to scan and repair your PST file.

In conclusion, having a stuck Outlook inbox can be frustrating and time-consuming. However, by applying these five surprising hacks, you can get your messages flowing smoothly again. Clean up your inbox, disable add-ins, compact your mailbox, reduce the size of your attachments, and repair any corrupt PST files. With these tips, you can keep your Outlook inbox running like a well-oiled machine.

Others need to fix Outlook not automatically updating inboxes (it only updates them after users restart the app).
 
In the worst scenario, users don’t receive any emails at all when Outlook’s inbox updating gets entirely stuck. So, it’s quite essential for some users to fix Outlook inbox stuck issues.
 
## Why is my Outlook not showing new emails?
 
Outlook often doesn’t update inboxes because of mail synchronization issues. When that application’s mail synchronization fails, it can’t update your inbox with new emails.
 
The causes of such Outlook synchronization issues can be varied. These are some of the more likely reasons for Outlook not updating its inbox:
 
- A corrupted OST data file
 - Conflicting third-party antivirus software
 - Cached Exchange Mode syncing issues
 - IPv6 network connection issues
 - An Outlook client installation issue (corrupted application files, etc)

 
Here are five ways you may be able to apply in order to fix Outlook when it’s not updating the inbox.
 
## How do I fix my Outlook inbox not updating?
 
### 1. Disable Cached Exchange Mod
 
- Click Outlook’s File tab.
 - Press the Account Settings button.
 - Click Change on the Account Settings window.
 - Disable (deselect) the Used Cached Exchange Mode option.
 - Press the Account Settings window’s Next button.
 - Click OK on the dialog box that says you need to restart Outlook.
 - Then restart your Outlook software.

 
### 2. Delete (rebuild) Outlook’s OST file
 
- Launch the Run dialog accessory (the quickest method for opening that app is to press Windows + R).
 - Then input this directory location in the Open box: %localappdata%/Microsoft
 - Click OK to bring up a Microsoft folder.
 - Open the Outlook subfolder from there.
 - Right-click Outlook’s OST data file to select Delete.

 
### 3. Disable third-party antivirus software
 
Third-party antivirus utilities can be a nuisance for Outlook and other email clients. If you’ve installed antivirus software on your PC, disabling that tool could be a solution.
 
Right-click your antivirus app’s icon in the Windows system tray area to bring up its context menu. Select a disable or turn off setting on that context menu to temporarily the antivirus utility’s shield.
 
Then go back to Outlook to see if it updates the inbox ok with your antivirus software turned off. If it does, either uninstall your antivirus software or add Outlook to its exceptions (exclusion) list.
 
### 4. Disable IPv6
 
- Open Run’s window.
 - Input this Network and Sharing Center Run command and click OK: control.exe /name Microsoft.NetworkAndSharingCenter
 - Then click that Control Panel applet’s Change adapter settings navigation option.
 - Right-click your internet connection adapter and select Properties.
 - Uncheck the Internet Protocol Version 6 checkbox.
 - Select OK to apply the new setting.

 
### 5. Repair the MS Office Suite
 
- Bring up Windows 11’s or 10’s search box. Pressing Windows + S will open that search tool.
 - To find Programs and Features, input appwiz.cpl in the search box.
 - Click appwiz.cpl to bring up the Control Panel’s uninstaller tool.
 - Select your MS Office application listed within Programs and Features.
 - Press its Change button.
 - Select the Repair radio button if you’re using Office 2016. Office 365 users should select the more thorough Online Repair option.
 - Click the Repair or Continue button.
