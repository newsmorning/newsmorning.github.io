You may have experienced a sudden line appearing on your landline phone screen and wondered what it means. It can be a shocking discovery, especially if you are not familiar with the technology. However, if you know the reasons behind it, you can easily get it fixed. 

There are a few common reasons why a mysterious line appears on the phone screen. In this article, we will take a closer look at those reasons and explain what each of them means. 

1. Dead Pixels 

Dead pixels are a common issue with any type of screen, including landline phone screens. A dead pixel is a pixel that has stopped working and will appear as a small line on the screen. It can appear in different colors or as a black line. 

Fortunately, dead pixels are not harmful to your phone and can be easily fixed. Most of the time, they will disappear on their own after a while. However, if they persist, you can try gently rubbing the screen with a cloth or bringing it to a professional for repair. 

2. Software Error 

Another reason why a mysterious line may appear on your landline phone screen is because of a software error. It can happen when there is an issue with the operating system of your phone. 

A software error can be fixed by restarting your phone or resetting the factory settings. If neither of those options work, then it may be best to contact the manufacturer for assistance. 

3. Damaged Screen 

A damaged screen is the most serious reason behind a mysterious line appearing on your landline phone screen. It can happen when the phone is dropped, hit, or exposed to extreme temperatures. 

If your phone screen is damaged, it will need to be replaced. Replacing the screen can be costly, but it's better than trying to use a phone with a damaged screen. 

In conclusion, while a mysterious line on your landline phone screen can be alarming, it's important to remain calm and identify the cause. Dead pixels, software errors, and damaged screens are the most common reasons behind this issue. By understanding these reasons and seeking professional help when needed, you can get your phone back in working order.

## Chosen Solution
 i have a line on my home telephone screen and cant read the contact list can this be fixed?

 Hi, 
I don’t know the phone but you could try removing the battery from the phone and leaving it out for about 5 minutes and then reinsert it and check the display to see if the line has gone. It could have appeared due to a “glitch” occurring and the battery is maintaining it being shown
I’m not sure with your phone make and model, if you may have to re-register the phone with the base station and whether or not you may have lost any stored info in the phone if you try this.
If this doesn’t work then most probably there is a problem with the LCD display unit.
You could open the phone and check for loose solder connections from the board to the LCD display unit but it also may be in the LCD display unit itself.
Getting a replacement display might be difficult.
If you want to try replacing the display unit, look for a part number printed on the back of the display itself and then search online using the part number to see if there are any suppliers.
An alternative option is to get a replacement phone - example only.
A replacement LCD display, if you can find one would probably cost the same if not more than the replacement phone shown above.
Unfortunately these types of phones are not really designed to be repaired as usually the way to get replacement parts for most portable landline telephones is to try and find a “faulty donor phone” online i.e. advertised as ‘faulty good for parts” at a reasonable or better still a low price and hope that the part that you want from it is still working.
