# You won't believe what happens to water resistance after Apple repairs a cracked home button on an iPhone 7 Plus!

If you own an iPhone 7 Plus, you know how essential it is to have a functional home button. Not only does it allow you to return to the home screen, but it enables you to use Siri and make purchases with Apple Pay. However, accidents happen, and perhaps you dropped your iPhone, causing the home button to crack. You took it to Apple for repair, and it was as simple as that. But did you know that the water resistance of your iPhone may have been compromised?

When the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were released, Apple boasted that they had achieved an IP67 water and dust resistance rating. This rating meant that the devices could withstand being submerged under up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. The achievement was primarily due to the omission of the headphone jack and the sealing of all critical openings, including the home button, with adhesives and gaskets.

The home button on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus uses a solid-state mechanism, which means that it is pressure-sensitive and not mechanical. In other words, when you press the button, it does not move, but sensors underneath detect the input. If you ever needed to replace your home button, it would need to be recalibrated to work with the sensors.

This recalibration is where the water resistance problem lies. When you drop your iPhone and crack the home button, you run the risk of damaging the solid-state mechanism that detects pressure. This mechanism is connected to the calibration of the home button, which means that it needs to be replaced with a new one when the button cracks. However, recalibration can only be achieved with special equipment found in Apple's repair centers.

When you take your iPhone to Apple for a home button repair, they will often replace the button and recalibrate it. However, this process requires the removal of the adhesive and gasket that seal the home button to maintain the water resistance of the device. Without sealing, the inside of the iPhone can be exposed to water, dust, and other debris that can lead to further damage.

After a home button repair, many users have noticed that their iPhones are no longer water-resistant. Some claim that their devices have stopped working after being exposed to small amounts of water, while others have reported increased noise during calls due to dust buildup. Although Apple does not guarantee water resistance after repairs, it is essential to be aware of the risk.

To be on the safe side, it is recommended that users avoid getting their iPhones wet after a home button repair or invest in waterproof cases. It is also crucial to have your device repaired by a certified Apple technician who follows the guidelines set by Apple to ensure the water resistance rating is not compromised.

In conclusion, getting your iPhone 7 Plus's home button repaired can break the water resistance seal, leaving your device susceptible to water damage. While Apple will recalibrate the home button after repairing it, the adhesive and gasket that maintain water resistance are often removed. Thus, extra precautions should be taken to protect your device from water damage after a home button repair.

## Chosen Solution
 My iPhone 7 plus home button is cracked. I called apple , they said to walk in to service center. Will I get its water resistance after replacing the home by apple service center

 Hi,
Quick answer is that if you go into an Apple Authorized service center (or into an Apple Retail store) for service that feature of the phone would be maintained. Apple has very strict repair guidelines for Apple Authorized service providers.
If you go to a 3rd Party repair shop there would be no guarantee.
Here is the website to check for Apple Authorized repair stores in your area:
