Loop Hero is a unique and addictive game that challenges players to craft the perfect loop for their hero. One of the most sought-after rewards in the game is scrap and stable metal, which are essential for unlocking new cards and upgrading buildings. In this epic farming guide, we'll show you how to unlock the secret hoard of scrap and stable metal in Loop Hero.

### Understanding the Basics

Before we dive into the farming strategies, it's essential to have a basic understanding of scrap and stable metal in Loop Hero. Scrap is a common crafting material that can be used to create various cards, while stable metal is a rare material that is only used for building upgrades. Both materials can be obtained by defeating certain enemies and bosses in the game.

### Farming Strategies

1. Focus on Enemies that Drop Scrap and Stable Metal

To obtain scrap and stable metal, you must defeat enemies that drop them. We suggest focusing on the enemies that drop them the most, such as the goblin, the vampire, and the harpy. You can identify these enemies by their icon on the game map. It's also worth noting that higher-level enemies drop more scrap and stable metal.

2. Farm Bosses

Bosses are formidable enemies that offer significant rewards when defeated. They are much more challenging to defeat than regular enemies, but the effort is worth it. Bosses, such as the Lich and the Priestess, drop a large amount of scrap and stable metal when defeated. Remember to equip your hero with powerful gear and cards to increase your chances of winning.

3. Use the Rogue Class

The Rogue class is one of the best classes for farming scrap and stable metal in Loop Hero. The Rogue's "Adventurer" ability allows you to loot an additional treasury every time you defeat an enemy. This means you'll have more chances to obtain scraps and stable metal. It's also worth noting that the Rogue has a higher chance of looting rare items, including stable metal.

4. Build the Treasury and Farming Buildings

Building the Treasury is an essential part of farming scrap and stable metal in Loop Hero. The Treasury increases the number of cards and resources you obtain from enemies. The Farm and Grove buildings also increase your chances of obtaining scrap and stable metal. The Farm increases the drop rate of food and scrap, while the Grove increases the drop rate of sap and stable metal.

5. Use the Alchemist's Tent

The Alchemist's Tent is a building that can convert unwanted items into useful resources. You can use this building to convert your unwanted cards and items into scrap and stable metal. It's a handy way to obtain these resources if you're running low.

### Final Thoughts

Farming scrap and stable metal in Loop Hero can be a daunting task, but with the right strategies, it can be a rewarding experience. By focusing on enemies that drop scrap and stable metal, farming bosses, using the Rogue class, building the treasury and farming buildings, and using the Alchemist's Tent, you can unlock the game's secret hoard of scrap and stable metal. Good luck!

## How To Get Scrap Metal And Stable Metal In Loop Hero
 
The easiest way to get scrap metal in Loop hero is by placing down a treasury card and then surrounding it with Meadows, Rock, and Mountain Cards.

Once you have 13 pieces of Scrap metal with you, it will be converted into a Stable Metal piece.
 
The best thing about scrap metal is the fact that it regularly is acquired from a treasury among other things.
