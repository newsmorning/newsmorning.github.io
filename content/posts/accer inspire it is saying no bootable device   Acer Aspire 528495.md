# Is Your Acer Aspire Showing No Bootable Device? Find Out How to Fix It Now!

If you own an Acer Aspire laptop, you may have experienced the frustrating issue of an error message that says "No Bootable Device." This error can occur due to various reasons, such as a malfunctioning hard drive, corrupted BIOS settings, faulty system files, or even incorrect boot order.

However, before you panic and think about buying a new laptop, you can try some solutions to fix the issue yourself. Here's how to do it.

## Solution 1: Check Your USB, CD/DVD, or Other Peripheral Drives

If you have connected any USB flash drives, external hard drives, or CD/DVD drives to your laptop, you need to make sure that they are not causing the issue. Sometimes, these drives can conflict with the boot process and prevent the laptop from starting up correctly.

To check if any peripheral drives are causing the issue, do the following:

1. Disconnect all peripheral drives from your laptop.
2. Reboot your laptop and check if the issue has been resolved.
3. If your laptop starts up correctly, reconnect each peripheral drive one by one, rebooting your laptop after each connection until you find the one causing the issue.

## Solution 2: Check Your BIOS Settings

The Boot Configuration Data (BCD) in your BIOS settings can sometimes become corrupted or misconfigured, leading to the "No Bootable Device" error. To fix this issue, you can try following these steps:

1. Turn off your laptop and turn it back on.
2. Immediately press the F2 key (or the key indicated on your screen) to access the BIOS settings.
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the Boot tab.
4. Check if your hard drive is listed as the first boot device. If not, select it and move it to the top of the boot order using the "+" key.
5. Save the changes and exit the BIOS settings.
6. Reboot your laptop and check if the issue has been resolved.

## Solution 3: Repair Your Operating System

If the above solutions don't work, your operating system may have become corrupted or damaged. In this case, you can try repairing your operating system using the Windows installation media or the Acer Recovery Management tool. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Windows installation media or the Acer Recovery Management USB/DVD into your laptop.
2. Reboot your laptop and press the F12 key (or the key indicated on your screen) to access the boot menu.
3. Use the arrow keys to select the Windows installation media or the Acer Recovery Management tool.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to repair your operating system.
5. Reboot your laptop and check if the issue has been resolved.

If none of these solutions work, there may be a hardware issue with your laptop's hard drive or motherboard. In this case, it's best to take your laptop to a professional technician or contact Acer support for assistance.

In summary, the "No Bootable Device" error on your Acer Aspire laptop can be caused by various issues, but these solutions can help you fix the issue in most cases. So, try them out and get your laptop back up and running.

 hello i have accer inspire it is saying no bootable device and now i follow all the step but they is no option of legacy on my option

 If you are getting a “no bootable device” error, then your computer cannot access either Windows or the entire hard drive. Since you were able to get into you BIOS to see that there is no legacy option, try removing any USB drives that are attached to the computer and boot into BIOS again. Go to the “Boot” tab and make sure that your Windows installation is first on the boot order list. That will force you computer to boot from Windows.
If you can’t  find the “Windows” option in your computer’s boot order, then try installing Windows.  You can download Windows from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software... and create a bootable DVD or USB with the downloaded file.
Then, attach the bootable DVD or USB to you computer and turn it on. The Acer will automatically boot from the USB or DVD and allow you to install Windows on your hard drive.
If there is no hard drive at all, then you may purchase one and install it. Hopefully your model is on the list at Acer Aspire Repair; the instructions on how to replace the hard drive may be found on this site.
