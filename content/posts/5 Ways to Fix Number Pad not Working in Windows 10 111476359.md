Revive Your Dead Number Pad: 5 Easy Fixes to Get it Working Again in Windows 10/11!

If you are an avid user of a desktop keyboard, you know how important number pads are. The number pad is the perfect tool for quickly entering numbers, making your work more efficient. Unfortunately, sometimes the number pad on your keyboard may stop working, which could be a result of a number of issues. This can be quite frustrating, but there's no need to worry. In this article, we will outline five easy fixes to get your dead number pad working again in Windows 10/11!

1. Check Your Num Lock
The first and easiest thing to check when your number pad isn't working is the Num Lock key. This key is responsible for turning the number pad on and off, so if it's off, the number pad won't work. Ensure the Num Lock key is on by pressing it once, and then try using the number pad again.

2. Check Your Keyboard Connection
Another possible reason why the number pad might not be working is a faulty keyboard connection. Check that your keyboard is properly connected to your computer. If it's a wired keyboard, unplug and re-plug it into your computer. If it's a wireless keyboard, ensure that the Bluetooth connection is still active.

3. Update Your Keyboard Drivers
Sometimes, your keyboard drivers might be outdated, leading to a malfunction of the number pad. To fix this, update your keyboard drivers. To do this, follow the steps below:

a. Type “Device Manager” into the search box on the bottom left corner of your screen.

b. Choose “Device Manager” from the results.

c. Locate the keyboard driver under “Keyboards” and select it.

d. Right-click on the driver and choose “Update driver.”

e. Follow the prompts to update the driver.

4. Restart Your Computer
If none of the above steps have worked, try restarting your computer. This will refresh your keyboard drivers and may solve the problem.

5. Check Your Registry
Your Registry is a vital part of your Windows operating system that stores information related to your computer's configuration, hardware, and software. If the Registry contains incorrect or corrupted settings, it could lead to issues with your keyboard, including the number pad. Here's how to check your registry:

a. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.

b. Type "regedit" in the box and press OK.

c. Navigate to the following location: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard

d. Double-click "InitialKeyboardIndicators."

e. Change the value to "2."

f. Click "OK."

In conclusion, these are just a few of the many ways you can revive your dead number pad on your keyboard in Windows 10/11. These simple fixes should get you back on track and typing up those number-heavy documents in no time.

Join us while we take a closer look at the keyboard issues, and try to find out why the number pad is not working on Windows 10.
 
## Why is the number pad not working on my keyboard?
 
There are numerous reasons, but the most common one is that the Num Lock key isn’t pressed. So, they need to be adequately enabled to use these keys for input.

#### Do all keyboards have a number pad?
 
No, not every keyboard has a number pad. Only the full-size keyboards have this feature, but since many don’t use it frequently, some manufacturers aren’t adding it to their devices.

#### What to do if Num Lock is not working?
 
Since the causes of the Num Lock key not working are well-known, the fixes are not far off too. One sure solution is to disable the mouse key from the ease of access settings.
