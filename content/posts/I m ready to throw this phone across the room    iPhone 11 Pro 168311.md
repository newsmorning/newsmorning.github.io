The iPhone 11 Pro is one of the most popular smartphones in the world today. Its sleek design, advanced camera system, and numerous features have made it a must-have for millions of people. However, there is a dark side to this beloved device that many people are unaware of - its addictive qualities.

Over the years, technology has become more intertwined in our daily lives, and the iPhone 11 Pro is no exception. Unfortunately, the constant use of this device is causing people to become addicted, leading to devastating consequences.

One of the most significant problems with the iPhone 11 Pro is the constant notifications that it sends to its users. Every time a message, email, or social media update arrives, the phone vibrates, and a notification sound is made. This constant stimulation can lead to an addiction to check the device, even in situations where it is inappropriate, like when driving or during a meeting.

Another issue is the social validation that people get from their iPhones. Social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have made it easy for people to get likes, comments, and other forms of validation for their posts. The constant need for this validation has become a form of addiction for many people, leading to negative self-esteem and depression.

Furthermore, the iPhone 11 Pro offers a range of apps and games that are designed to be addictive. These apps are created with the purpose of keeping you hooked and spending more time on your device. The more time you spend on the phone, the more money the app developers make.

In conclusion, the iPhone 11 Pro is a powerful device that has many features that make our lives easier. However, its addictive qualities are leading many people to the brink of destruction. It is essential that we recognize the potential harm that our phones can do and take steps to reduce our usage. Ultimately, moderation is key when it comes to our relationship with technology.

## Chosen Solution
 Replacing screen.
Iâ€™m on my second screen.
Everything is connected.
#  Phone turns on, I can hear and feel the vibrations.
Screen is responding to my touch.Screen is black, I cannot see anything of the screen and/or a very dimly Apple logo upon start up.

 This is the symptom of a faulty ambient light sensor. It might have got damaged during the screen replacement.

 hello David,
it seems to be like faulty new screen panel, it happens sometimes. But, most cases (you nothing write about a reason of change) its just a badly inserted screen connector into the port. Don't forget about first important electronic rule - battery firs when unplugging and the last when pluging.
It would be a good practice to go to a nearby repair shop and have your screen checked. It shouldn't cost a lot, just plug it in and check on another phone if it's not working. If, however, we'll wonder later.

 I'd second popping into a shop and see if they can test another screen for you.
You could try a soft reboot.
Or even dfu mode restore.
Sometimes, the aftermarket screens have ever so slightly bigger fpc connectors, and these can stretch out the board connectors, but this is rare.
Is It an oled or LCD replacement?
