Step 1: Find the Right Resources

To craft your mountain peak, you'll need to collect a variety of resources. These include:

- Mountains: Mountains are the foundation of your mountain peak. You'll need at least five mountains to create a mountain peak.
- Rocks: Rocks are used to build pathways and bridges. You'll need at least three rocks to create a mountain peak.
- Sand: Sand is used to create beaches and sandy areas. You'll need at least two sand to create a mountain peak.
- Snow: Snow is used to create a snowy terrain. You'll need at least two snow to create a mountain peak.
- Forests: Forests provide wood and are used to build cabins. You'll need at least one forest to create a mountain peak.
- Villages: Villages provide workers to help you craft your mountain peak. You'll need at least one village to create a mountain peak.

Step 2: Place the Resources

Once you've collected the resources, it's time to place them. Here's how to do it:

- Place your five mountains in a circle to create the base of your mountain peak.
- Place your three rocks around the mountains to create pathways and bridges.
- Place your two sand resources near the edge of the circle to create beaches.
- Place your two snow resources around the mountains to create a snowy terrain.
- Place your forest resource on the outer edge of the circle to create wood to build cabins.
- Finally, place your village resource on the outer edge of the circle to provide workers.

Step 3: Build Your Cabins

Your cabins are crucial in crafting your mountain peak. After placing your forest resource, you'll see a small cabin icon appear. Here's what to do:

- Click the cabin icon to build a cabin.
- Once the cabin is built, you can assign a worker to it.
- Assigning a worker to the cabin will give you the ability to build more cabins within its influence.

Step 4: Replicate the Basic Structure

Once you've created the basic structure of your mountain peak, you can replicate it several times within its influence. Here's how to do it:

- Place your first mountain peak structure as described above.
- Build cabins within its influence.
- Place a second mountain peak structure within one of the cabins' influences.
- Repeat until you have several mountain peak structures within the influence.

By replicating the basic structure of your mountain peak, you'll be able to get the maximum health boosts.
