1. Press the power button and wait for the Windows logo to appear.

Many people have reported issues after upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Pro. When asked, they claim to shut down their computer appropriately; but when they restart it, they get the message: “it looks like Windows didn’t load correctly.” The message indicates something went wrong with your computer, making it appear that Windows did load successfully. It disrupts the Windows loading process.
 
Don’t be concerned! In this article, we will offer a fundamental understanding of this error and show you how to solve it quickly.
 

 
## How to fix ‘it looks like Windows didn’t load correctly’ error?
 
### Method 1: Boot into Safe Mode and uninstall any recently installed programs
 
Safe Mode launches Windows with reduced capability, allowing you to perform diagnostics and troubleshooting. Using Safe Mode will help you to resolve the issue. You should remove any applications or drivers that you have recently installed as they could be behind the error. You can reinstall them later, but only if you do it correctly and from the official source. You must enter Safe Mode since the system cannot be booted owing to the “Windows won’t load correctly” problem. Let’s see the steps that you need to follow:
 
The following are the most prevalent reasons for this error in Windows PCs.
 
Cause 1: When the BCD gets corrupted or absent.
 
One of the most prevalent reasons for this problem is corrupted or missing Boot Configuration Data. This might be due to disk write problems, boot sector viruses, power outages, or mistakes while manually setting the BCD.
 
Cause 2: The integrity of the file system has been violated.
 
The file system itself can become corrupted or damaged for the same reasons. This occurs far more frequently if a computer is turned off while it is in the process of writing critical data to the boot sector.
 
Cause 3: System files have been corrupted.
 
Windows cannot load normally if vital system files are corrupted due to incorrect operations, viruses, and other factors.
 
Step 1: Restart your PC and hit F8 or Shift + F8 quickly while it is starting. (Note: This method only works if you have enabled F8 for Safe Mode before using Command Prompt. Otherwise, you need to Restart your PC 3 times using the Power button, to open the Automatic Repair window automatically.  
 
If you’re running Windows 7, the Advanced Boot Options page will appear immediately. Simply choose Safe Mode and hit the Enter key.
 
Step 2: If you’re running Windows 11, 10, 8.1, or 8, go to “Troubleshoot – Advanced Options – Startup Settings” and then select the “Restart” option. The Startup Settings screen will be shown. To boot in safe mode, select “Safe Mode.”
 
Step 3: The machine should now boot in safe mode, and the problem should no longer appear. You may now do further diagnostics if necessary.
