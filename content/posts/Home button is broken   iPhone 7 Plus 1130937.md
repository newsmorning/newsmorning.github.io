# Is Your iPhone 7 Plus Home Button Destroying Your Life? Find Out Why Now!

If you’re an iPhone 7 Plus user, there’s a good chance you’ve been struggling with a pesky issue – the Home button. Many users have reported that the button is not functioning as it once did, or that it has become completely unresponsive. This can be frustrating, to say the least, especially if you rely on your device for everyday use. But why is this happening, and what can you do about it? 

## The Problem with the iPhone 7 Plus Home Button

To understand the issue with the iPhone 7 Plus Home button, we need to first take a closer look at the design of the device. Unlike earlier models, the iPhone 7 Plus does not have a physical button that moves up and down when pressed. Instead, it relies on a “taptic engine” that produces vibrations to simulate the sensation of pressing a button. 

While this design was meant to increase the durability of the device, it has resulted in a number of issues for users. Many have reported that the button is slow to respond or that it does not respond at all. Others have complained that the button feels “sticky” or “mushy,” making it difficult to use. 

## Why Is This Happening?

There are a few reasons why the iPhone 7 Plus Home button may be causing problems for users. First, it’s possible that the button simply needs to be recalibrated. This can be done by going to the “Settings” app, selecting “General,” and then “Accessibility.” From there, select “Home Button” and follow the on-screen instructions to recalibrate the button. 

Another possible explanation is that the button has become dirty or damaged over time. If this is the case, you may need to clean the button or have it repaired or replaced. 

Finally, some users have reported that the issue is caused by a software glitch. If this is the case, updating your device to the latest version of iOS may be the solution. 

## What Can You Do?

If you’re experiencing problems with your iPhone 7 Plus Home button, there are a few steps you can take to address the issue. 

First, try recalibrating the button using the method described above. This is a simple process that may help to restore the button’s functionality. 

If that doesn’t work, try cleaning the button using a soft, dry cloth. You may also want to try using a can of compressed air to blow any dust or debris out of the button. 

If neither of these solutions works, it may be time to have the button repaired or replaced. This can be done by taking your device to an authorized Apple service provider. 

## The Bottom Line

In conclusion, the iPhone 7 Plus Home button can be a major source of frustration for many users. Whether it’s slow to respond, unresponsive, or simply “sticky,” there are a number of reasons why this issue may be occurring. By following the steps outlined above, you can take steps to address the problem and get your device back to functioning as it should. So, if you’ve been struggling with a faulty Home button, don’t despair – there is help available!

## Chosen Solution
 iPhone 7plus home button stopped working along with speaker. I cannot watch videos on phone or put it on speaker. Will factory restarting help?
no water damage, I didn’t drop it, this was very out of the blue

 Yes Try Factory Reset. If it doesn't work then probably its going to be hardware problem, which i hope is not. But try erasing it via iTunes.
