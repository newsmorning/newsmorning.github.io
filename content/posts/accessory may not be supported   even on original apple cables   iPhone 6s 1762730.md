You Won't Believe Which iPhone Accessories Might Not Work with Original Apple Cables!

If you own an iPhone, you know how important it is to have a trusty charging cable by your side at all times. However, not all charging cables are created equal, and it turns out that not all iPhone accessories may be compatible with your original Apple cables.

One of the most common culprits when it comes to compatibility issues is third-party iPhone cases. While they may look sleek and stylish, some cases can actually interfere with the charging port on your phone, preventing the cable from properly connecting. This can be especially frustrating if you're trying to charge your phone in a hurry and don't have time to remove your case.

Another accessory that may not work with your original Apple cable is a car charger. While many car chargers claim to be compatible with iPhones, not all of them are created equal. Some car chargers may not deliver enough power to your phone, while others may cause the cable to become loose or disconnected.

Similarly, if you have an external battery pack for your iPhone, it's important to make sure that it's compatible with your original Apple cable. Some battery packs may not be able to deliver enough power to your phone, or may cause the cable to become loose and fall out.

If you're planning on using any of these accessories with your iPhone, it's important to do your research and make sure that they're compatible with your original Apple cable. While it may be tempting to purchase a cheaper third-party cable or accessory, it's often worth investing in the Apple-branded product to ensure that you're getting the best quality and compatibility.

In conclusion, there are a number of iPhone accessories that may not work with your original Apple cable. If you're experiencing charging or connectivity issues with your iPhone, it's worth checking if any of your accessories are the culprit. With the right equipment, you can ensure that your phone is always charged and ready to go when you need it.

## Chosen Solution
 iphone 6s says “accessory may not be supported” when charging.
i have tried multiple original Apple cables as well as 3rd party cables (both mifi certified and not).  there are 6 iphones and over 2 dozen good cables around the house (bad cables are clipped and tossed after repeated failures).
i have also tried “reset all settings” and upgraded to IOS 14.2.
i have cleaned out the charger port with a toothbrush, both dry and with a little bit of 99% IPA.
“replace the battery” seems to be a common mantra among problems, but the battery health reads 100%.
any thoughts on now to troubleshoot this further?
i’m not a pro, but i’m not averse to cracking it open and doing DIY phone surgery.
Thanks

 @beekerc since you already checked the original cables and chargers and you still have the same issues, the next step would be to replace the Lightning Connector assembly. iPhone 6s Lightning Connector Assembly Replacement
