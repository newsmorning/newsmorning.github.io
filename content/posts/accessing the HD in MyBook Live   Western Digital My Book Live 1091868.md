## Chosen Solution
 I had this MyBook for a few years, backing up to it my photos, music. Now, looks like it is dead. I extracted the hard drive from the MyBook enclosure and trying to connect to my PC (running Windows 10) using one of those "USB To SATA/IDE Hard Drive adapters." The drive shows up in the file manager fine, but if I click on it , it will show "G:\ Is Not Accessible. Invalid parameter". Any ideas, recommendations on how to recover/extract files? I really need those files...

 It looks as if your HDD is corrupted. You should try some data recovery software or take it to a professional to get your data off of it. I've recovered data off a hard drive formatted for mac using a mac so i dont know how it works with windows but from the way it sounds it got corrupted or worse the head got stuck on the disk. Try recovery software or take it to a pro
Hope this helps and good luck fixing!
