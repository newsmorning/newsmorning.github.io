# Rev Up Your Ride: The Ultimate 2012 Kawasaki Ninja Chain Tightening Replacement Guide! Don't Let Loose Chains Slow You Down!

If you’re an avid motorcycle enthusiast, you already know that the chain plays an essential role when it comes to achieving maximum performance on the road. The chain connects your bike's engine to the rear wheel, and any slack in the chain can severely impact your bike's performance. Luckily, with the right tools and a bit of know-how, replacing and tightening your 2012 Kawasaki Ninja chain is an easy and effective way to enhance your bike's overall performance.

In this guide, we'll take you step-by-step through the process of replacing and tightening your chain, helping you rev up your ride and safely hit the road.

## Preparation

Before we begin, make sure you have all the necessary tools on hand. For this process, you will need a rear stand, a torque wrench, a chain breaker, pliers, and a replacement chain.

Next, put your Kawasaki Ninja onto a rear stand and ensure the bike is stable and secure. This will give you the space you need to inspect and replace your chain.

## Inspect Your Chain

First, inspect your chain for any signs of wear and tear. Look for any links that appear bent, worn, or heavily rusted. If your chain appears to be in good condition with no visible damage, simply tighten the chain to eliminate slack. If the chain is damaged, it's time for a replacement.

## Remove the Old Chain

Using a chain breaker, separate the old chain from the rear sprocket. Once the chain is removed, take the time to clean the sprockets and any debris built up on the chain.

## Install the New Chain

Carefully thread the new chain through the sprockets, ensuring that the chain is fitting correctly with no twists or bends. Once the chain is in place, provide tension to the chain by adjusting the rear axle position. Loosen the rear axle bolts to adjust the wheel position forward or backward to achieve proper chain tension.

## Tighten and Torque the Axle Bolt

Using a torque wrench, tighten the axle nut to the factory recommended torque spec. Be careful not to overtighten the axle bolt, as this can cause the chain to bind during movement.

## Test Your Chain Tension

Now that your new chain is in place and tightened, test its tension by gently pressing down on the chain midway between the sprockets. Ideally, you should only be able to move the chain up/down 1-2 inches. If the chain is too tight or too loose, adjust the tension and repeat the test until the chain is properly tightened.

## Regulate Your Chain

Remember that your chain is an essential component of your motorcycle's performance. With use, your chain may need periodic maintenance to remain at optimal tension. Ensure that you check your chain regularly by inspecting it for wear and tear and adjusting tension as necessary. By doing so, you'll stay safe, improve fuel economy and extend the life of your motorcycle.

In conclusion, replacing and tightening your Kawasaki Ninja's chain is a straightforward process that can help you achieve top-notch motorcycle performance. Ensuring your chain's tension is adequately ducted will provide better handling and greater fuel efficiency. By using these steps, you can easily replace and re-secure your chain to rev up your ride for a fantastic and safer journey.

Step 3


 
- 
 - Notice the location of the slider on each side
 - 
 - This is located at the back of the bike on the rear wheel bars
 - 
 - Usually after use, the sliders become out of alignment and could be at different marker locations
 - 
 - Locate the bolt that travels through the hub of the wheel
 - 
 - This will be the largest bolt of the back of the wheel
 - 
 - Remove the locking pin holding the nut in place
 - 
 - Use the grips to bend the pin straight

- 
 - Remove the locking pin
 - 
 - Place your 17mm socket on the bolt side and the 1 inch side over the nut
 - 
 - This is where the breaker bar would help as it could be very tight
 - 
 - Loosen the bolt to about half way
 - 
 - Do not take the bolt out or the nut off

Step 5


 
- 
 - Locate the bolts on each side of the bike sticking out
 - 
 - There should be two nuts on each bolt
 - 
 - Loosen only the first nut on each side with a 12mm
 - 
 - This is the locking nut while the second one locks the chain in place.

- 
 - Begin tightening the second nut on the side with the chain (usually the left side) with a 14mm
 - 
 - You should visually see the chain tightening and the sliders moving which marks the chain position
 - 
 - Tighten to where there is about ½ to ¾ inch of play in the chain.
 - 
 - Notice the mark of the slider on the side you tightened first
 - 
 - Tighten the opposite side till the slider is in the same position as the first side you tightened
