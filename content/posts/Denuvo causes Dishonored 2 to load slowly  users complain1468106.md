Title: Gamers Beware: Denuvo's Slow Loading Time Ruins Dishonored 2 Experience!

Subtitle: How Denuvo's Anti-Piracy Technology Causes More Harm Than Good

Have you ever heard of Denuvo? It's an anti-piracy technology that has been gaining popularity among big gaming companies such as Bethesda, Square Enix, and Ubisoft. However, its use has been a topic of debate among gamers due to its negative effects on game performance.

Recently, Dishonored 2, a popular stealth-action game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks, was released. While the game's graphics and gameplay have received positive reviews, many gamers have been complaining about its slow loading time, which has been attributed to Denuvo's anti-piracy technology.

Denuvo is designed to prevent piracy by adding an extra layer of protection in a game's executable code. This makes it difficult for hackers to crack and illegally distribute the game. However, it also slows down the loading time of the game, making it frustrating for gamers who have spent a lot of money on it.

The loading time for Dishonored 2, which is approximately 100-120 seconds for PC users, is much longer than other games of similar size and complexity. This not only affects the initial loading screen but also causes delays in transitioning between different areas or levels within the game. This, in turn, disrupts the immersion of the gamers, and negatively impacts their overall experience.

Many gamers have taken to online forums to vent their frustrations, with some stating that they are considering returning the game because of its slow loading times. This situation highlights the need for game developers to prioritize the gaming experience over anti-piracy measures.

It's important to understand that piracy is a serious issue and that game developers need to protect their intellectual property. However, Denuvo's slow loading times demonstrate that there must be a balance between security measures and the gaming experience.

In conclusion, Denuvo's anti-piracy technology may seem like a useful tool for game developers, but it comes at a cost that negatively impacts gamers' experience. It's essential for game developers to consider alternative security measures that won't jeopardize the gaming experience. As for Dishonored 2, gamers beware – its slow loading time is not worth the frustration.


When Bethesda announced Dishonored 2 would come with Denuvo, gamers were generally unsatisfied. The fact that they wouldn’t be able to play the game on as many devices as they wanted angered a lot of people. However, it seems the Denuvo system is making even more of a mess.

 - Integrated with Twitch, Discord, Instagram, Twitter and Messengers directly
 - Built-in sound controls and custom music
 - Custom color themes by Razer Chroma and force dark pages
 - Free VPN and Ad blocker

Namely, some users report on the Steam Community forums that Denuvo slows the game at startup. Here’s what some of them say:
 
According to other users, this problem can be solved by disabling the Firewall in Windows. So, if you’re experiencing the problem with a slow loading screen, try doing this. However, not everyone has confirmed this solution is legitimate, so we can’t guarantee it will work.
 
“Everytime we launch Dishonored 2 the Denuvo loading screen, (the very first loading screen you get after launching the game), is loading so slow I timed it to one to two minutes at worst. The game have been doing this since we got it and no improvement yet. Sometimes but not often enough it can load a bit faster which appears to depend on what type of connection you have.”
 
In case you’re not familiar, Denuvo is a security technology that protects video games from being illegally copied and distributed. Denuvo has proven to be very effective in protecting AAA games from being pirated. Many large developers have started using this system. EA Sports and the recent games from the FIFA series are the best examples. In Dishonored 2‘s case, the system allows the game to be installed only on up to five PCs.
