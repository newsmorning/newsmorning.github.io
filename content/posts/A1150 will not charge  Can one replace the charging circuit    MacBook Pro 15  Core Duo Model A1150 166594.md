Title: Warning: Is Your Macbook Pro A1150 in Danger? Here's the Shocking Truth About its Charging Circuit!

Are you still using the old Macbook Pro A1150? If yes, then here's a piece of alarming news for you. Your laptop's charging circuit might be at risk, and you may not even know it. 

The Macbook Pro A1150 was released in 2006 and was one of the most popular laptops back then. However, over time, the technology inside it has become outdated, and users have reported several issues related to its charging circuit. Let's dive deeper into this issue to understand what's really happening.

Firstly, what is a charging circuit, and why is it essential for a laptop? The charging circuit is responsible for regulating the power and voltage supplied to your laptop. It ensures that your device is charged optimally without overheating, damaging the battery or other hardware components of your laptop. 

The Macbook Pro A1150's charging circuit is designed with a power management unit (PMU), which controls the voltage and current supplied to the system. However, over time, the PMU chip can weaken and malfunction, leading to several charging related problems, such as:

1. The battery not charging
2. The laptop not turning on even when connected to the charger
3. The battery draining quickly
4. The laptop overheating while charging 

The most common cause of the PMU chip malfunction is the high voltage supplied by the charger. Over time, the voltage output by the charger increases, ultimately damaging the PMU chip. This damage can go unnoticed for a long time, and as a result, the laptop's other components also get affected.

Now the question arises, what can you do to prevent this issue and ensure the longevity of your MacBook Pro A1150's charging circuit?

The first and foremost solution is to avoid using third-party chargers. Always use the original charger provided by Apple or a reputable third-party charger. You can also use a protection device or surge protector in between the charger and the laptop to prevent any voltage spikes or power surges.

Another solution is to reset the PMU chip ever few months. To do this, you need to disconnect the charger and remove the battery from your laptop. Then hold the power button for 20 seconds and release it. Reinsert the battery and connect the charger to the laptop. This process resets the PMU chip and resolves any charging-related issues.

In conclusion, the Macbook Pro A1150's charging circuit may be prone to malfunctioning due to the weakening of its PMU chip over time. However, with some precautions, you can prevent this issue and ensure a long and healthy life for your laptop. Always use the original charger and reset the PMU chip every few months. By following these simple steps, you can protect your laptop and enjoy using it for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a used A1150 (eBay) and it has never been able to charge at all. I followed all the troubleshooting guides from Apple's tech pages and went to my local Apple tech store. They switched the Magsafe and swapped the battery. Their battery worked fine but the Magsafe charger still did not work (it holds a very dim green light when attempting to charge). They said it probably was not the logic board but the actual charging circuit. What part(s) would I need to replace the charging circuit? can one replace the charging circuit without soldering?

 yes, the charging circuit should be on the left I/O Board, you can find the repair instructions here - replacing it does not involve soldering.

 They only switched the Magsafe adapter not the left I/O board. Sorry for not qualifying that. @rab777hp
Great tutorial @bac. i will grab a few tools and find a replacement left I/O board. Thanks!

 Are you sure it's not the battery?  The computer end of the Magsafe on this model of Macbook Pro glows red when the battery is depleted and green when fully charged.

 My bet would be the Left side I/O board.  Not difficult to replace, but parts getting hard to come by!
