Windows has been around for over three decades now, and over the years, it has evolved tremendously to become the most widely used operating system in the world. Throughout these years, each new version of Windows has come with new features, improved performance, and added security. While Windows users might recognize the various version numbers, few might be aware of the interesting history behind them.\nIn this article, we’ll explore the surprising history behind every Windows version number you’ve ever used.\nWindows 1.0 Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, and marked the beginning of the Windows era. It was designed as a graphical user interface to run on top of MS-DOS, a popular operating system at the time. Windows 1.0 featured basic programs like Notepad, Paint, and Calculator, and also introduced several new features such as overlapping windows, scrollbars, and icons.\nWindows 2.0 Windows 2.0 was released on December 9, 1987, and introduced several new features, including support for expanded memory, improved graphics, and the ability to run multiple programs simultaneously. It also marked the first appearance of the popular solitaire game.\nWindows 3.0 Windows 3.0 was released on May 22, 1990, and was a significant upgrade over its predecessor. It introduced support for virtual memory, which allowed for more efficient use of memory, improved performance, and better support for multimedia applications. Windows 3.0 also introduced the File Manager and Program Manager, which made it easier to manage files, applications, and system settings.\nWindows 95 Windows 95 was released on August 24, 1995, and was a huge success for Microsoft. It was the first version of Windows to feature the iconic Start button, which became a staple of all subsequent Windows versions. Windows 95 also introduced support for long filenames, the Taskbar, and the ability to run 32-bit applications.\nWindows 98 Windows 98 was released on June 25, 1998, and was the first version of Windows to include support for USB devices. It also introduced several new features such as Internet Explorer 4.0, Windows Driver Model (WDM), and the ability to open and close the CD tray from the desktop.\nWindows 2000 Windows 2000 was released on February 17, 2000, and was designed for both home and business use. It introduced several new features like Active Directory, which made it easier to manage users and resources on a network, and support for Plug and Play devices. Windows 2000 was also the first Microsoft operating system to support 64-bit CPUs.\nWindows XP Windows XP was released on October 25, 2001, and is one of the most popular versions of Windows to date. It introduced several new features like the Windows Media Player, Remote Desktop, and improved support for wireless networking. Windows XP also marked the end of the MS-DOS era as it was the first Microsoft operating system to not include DOS as a core component.\nWindows Vista Windows Vista was released on January 30, 2007, and was the first version of Windows to feature a new user interface, known as Aero. It also introduced several new features such as the Windows Sidebar, Windows DVD Maker, and improved security features like User Account Control (UAC).\nWindows 7 Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009, and was a significant improvement over Windows Vista. It introduced several new features like Aero Snap, which allowed users to easily organize open windows on their desktops, and improved support for touchscreens. Windows 7 also marked the beginning of the end of the Windows operating system, as Microsoft shifted its focus to the cloud.\nWindows 8 Windows 8 was released on October 26, 2012, and was a radical departure from all previous versions of Windows. It featured a new touch-optimized interface, known as Metro, that was designed for both desktop and tablet use. However, Windows 8 was met with mixed reviews, as many users found the new interface confusing and difficult to use.\nWindows 10 Windows 10 was released on July 29, 2015, and is the latest version of Windows as of 2021. It is designed to work across a wide variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones. Windows 10 introduced several new features such as Cortana, a personal digital assistant, and the ability to run universal apps across multiple devices. It also marked the end of the traditional Windows release cycle, as Microsoft shifted to a continuous update model.\nIn conclusion, the history of Windows version numbers is a fascinating one, reflecting how technology has evolved over time. We hope this article has provided an insight into the various version numbers and their key features. Even if you’re not a tech expert, it’s always interesting to learn about the technology we use every day.\nEach Microsoft Windows operating system has a familiar name, such as Windows 11 or Windows Vista, but behind each common name is an actual Windows version number1.\nWindows Version Numbers Below is a list of major Windows versions and their associated version numbers:\nYou can determine your Windows version a number of ways if you want to check which build number you’re currently running.\n[1] More specific than a version number, at least in Windows, is a build number, often indicating exactly what major update or service pack has been applied to that Windows version. This is the last number shown in the version number column, like 7600 for Windows 7. Some sources note the build number in parenthesis, like 6.1 (7600).\n[2] Windows XP Professional 64-bit had its own version number of 5.2. As far as we know, that’s the only time Microsoft has designated a special version number for a specific edition and architecture-type of a Windows operating system.\n[3] Service pack updates to Windows XP did update the build number but in a very minor and long-winded way. For example, Windows XP with SP3 and other small updates is listed as having a version number of 5.1 (Build 2600.xpsp_sp3_qfe.130704-0421 : Service Pack 3).\nHow to Update Windows To update Windows to the newest build number, use Windows Update. The built-in Windows Update utility is the easiest way to check for and install Windows updates.\nIf you haven’t set up your version of Windows to install updates automatically, you can change the Windows Update settings so that new updates are downloaded and applied automatically. It’s the simplest way to keep Windows updated to the latest version number.\nMajor Changes in Windows 10 Microsoft introduced several changes to the Windows operating system with Windows 10. These are some of the most significant differences between Windows 10 and Windows 8 (and older versions of Windows):\nCortana comes built-in to Windows 10 Microsoft Edge is pre-installed as a replacement browser for Internet Explorer Brand-new versions of Mail, Calendar, Maps, and Photos Expanded notifications are available through Windows Action Center User interface that works well with both touch screen displays and traditional monitors that use a keyboard and mouse Windows 10’s Start menu replaces the full-screen Windows 8 Start Screen Microsoft Paint 3D replaces Microsoft Paint Share files wirelessly with other PCs using Windows Nearby Sharing Set quiet hours by blocking notifications with Windows Focus Assist Windows Hello lets you log in to Windows 10, apps, and websites with your face Play Xbox One games on your Windows computer Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day\nLatest Windows Service Packs and Updates\nHow to Properly Reinstall Software in Windows\nHow to Change Windows Update Settings\nMicrosoft Windows 8.1\nWhat Version of Windows Do I Have?\n10 Best Free Software Updater Programs\nPatch Tuesday\nCommand Availability Across Microsoft Operating Systems\nHow Do I Find a Driver’s Version Number?\nWindows 12: News and Expected Price, Release Date, Specs;
