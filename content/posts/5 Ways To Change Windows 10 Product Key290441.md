By using a product key to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, you can access the Group Policy Editor to modify System Tray settings. Just search for "gpedit.msc" in the Start menu, navigate to User Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Start Menu and Taskbar, and select "Remove the clock from the system notification area." From there, you can choose which icons to display in the System Tray.

4. Enable Dark Mode

If you prefer a darker theme for your Windows 10 display, you can easily enable Dark Mode. Simply go to the Start menu, click on Settings, then Personalization, and select Colors.
