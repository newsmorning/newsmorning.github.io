Title: Macbook Pro 13 Retina Late 2013 Saved from Liquid Spill Disaster - Find Out How with Flashing Folder Trick!

Introduction:
As a MacBook Pro user, we all have faced some disasters with our device such as liquid spills. Accidentally spilling water or coffee on your MacBook Pro can cause a lot of damage to the hardware, and the immediate reaction is to panic. In this article, we will talk about how a flash folder trick can help save your MacBook Pro from a liquid spill disaster, specifically a MacBook Pro 13 Retina late 2013 model.

Body:
1. What is a Flashing Folder Trick?
The flashing folder trick is a diagnostic startup feature on a MacBook Pro that helps to identify and troubleshoot startup problems. When your device fails to start, this feature helps to show a flashing folder icon with a question mark. When the MacBook Pro starts, it automatically looks for a bootable operating system. If it can't find one, it shows the flashing folder icon. That's where the flash folder trick comes in. It forces the Mac to continue the boot process and search for the available system.

2. How to Use the Flashing Folder Trick to Save Your MacBook Pro 13 Retina Late 2013 Model?
If you face a liquid spill disaster and your MacBook Pro won't start, you can use the flashing folder trick to revive it. Follow the steps below:

a) Power off your MacBook Pro.
b) Turn your MacBook Pro back on, and immediately hold down the Command + Option + P + R keys.
c) Keep holding those keys until your MacBook Pro restarts.
d) Release the keys after hearing the startup sound the second time.
e) If the MacBook Pro successfully boots, you will see a flashing folder icon.
f) Restart your MacBook Pro again, and this time, hold down the Option key immediately after hearing the startup sound.
g) Release the Option key when you see the available system to continue the boot process.

3. Additional Tips:
If you have already tried the flashing folder trick and your MacBook Pro still won't start, you can try other options such as:

a) Take your MacBook Pro to the nearest Apple store or authorized service provider.
b) Use a data recovery tool to recover your data and transfer it to another device.
c) Learn how to protect your MacBook Pro from future liquid spills by taking precautionary measures such as using waterproof keyboard covers, avoiding eating and drinking around your device, and keeping your MacBook Pro away from pets and children.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, a liquid spill disaster is not the end of your MacBook Pro. With the flashing folder trick, you can revive your device and restore it to its full functionality. However, keep in mind that this is only a temporary solution. If your MacBook Pro continues to display problems, it's best to take action by seeking professional help and taking preventive measures to avoid similar situations from happening again.

## Chosen Solution
 hi
After a liquid spill i carefully cleaned the inside of my macbook pro 13" retina with isopropyl alcohol.
Now the flashing folder with the question mark keeps on getting in my way. I tried Pram (or something like that) reset, i tried recovery mode, but there they couldn't find my ssd, I tried bootable usb... nothing so far
i didn't submerge my logic board or ssd so there are or could still be some ice tea spots.
I'm  really in need of help cause I can't pay the fix and i need the laptop for college.
kind regards
baptiste

 Give it a ultrasonic cleaning. Probably some iced tea still stuck under the chips. :)
