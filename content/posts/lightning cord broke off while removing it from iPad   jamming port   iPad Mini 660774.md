Did your Lightning Cord just break off inside your iPad Mini? Here's what you need to do!

If you are a frequent iPad Mini user, one of your biggest concerns might be the durability of your charging cords. Unfortunately, accidents happen, and sometimes the Lightning cord can break off inside the iPad Mini, posing a frustrating and challenging problem. So, what do you do when that happens?

Firstly, don't panic or force the remaining piece of cord out of your device. Any attempt to do so can lead to further damage or worse, damage to the internal components of the iPad Mini. Here are some steps to help you safely remove the broken Lightning cord from your device:

Step 1: Unplug your iPad Mini from the charger and switch it off.

Step 2: Get a toothpick or a wooden skewer, and gently insert it into the Lightning port to identify which side of the cord is broken off.

Step 3: Once you have identified the broken-off piece, get a pair of tweezers, and carefully grip the exposed end of the cord.

Step 4: Gently pull the broken piece out of the Lightning port, ensuring that you do not exert too much pressure, which could cause further damage.

Step 5: If you face some resistance while removing the cord, stop, and avoid forcing it. Instead, try gently wiggling it back and forth or rotating it to loosen it up before attempting to remove it again.

Step 6: Once the broken piece is out, use a flashlight to inspect the Lightning port and ensure there are no broken pieces or debris inside.

Step 7: If there is debris in the Lightning port, use a soft-bristled brush to clean it out gently.

Step 8: You can now plug in your charging cable and switch on your iPad Mini to ensure it charges as it should.

In conclusion, a broken Lightning cord inside your iPad Mini can be stressful, but it does not have to be a disaster. Remember not to panic, avoid forcing out the broken piece, and follow the steps mentioned above to safely remove it. However, if you are unsure or feel uncomfortable doing it yourself, take your device to a professional service center for assistance. Always handle your devices with care to avoid such situations in the future.

## Chosen Solution
 Half of the metal charger broke off, leaving other half stuck inside my iPad mini.
How can I fix this?

 Can you fit a set of tweezers in there?
I've honestly never had this.  I am tempted to break a lightning cable off inside one just to find out how to fix it.

 Like a broken-off headphone plug, some people have had luck using superglue on the remainder of the plug and using it to pull the broken-off tip out of the lightning socket.
Here's an example from YouTube.
This is inherently risky, so be careful!

 so i was takin the charger of my phone and it just broke

 fishing hook works well

 get something tiny and add glue to it and then put in the pes that is stuck and then let it driy and  last you pull it out.

 I got the whole metal piece stuck in the phone. I got mine out with some small toe nail clippers from the dollar tree.
