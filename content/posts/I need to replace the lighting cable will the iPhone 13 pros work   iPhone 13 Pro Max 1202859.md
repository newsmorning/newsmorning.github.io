If you are, then you will be pleased to know that the new iPhone 13 Pros and Pro Max might save you from these charging woes!

The iPhone 13 Pros and Pro Max come with a revolutionary new feature that will change the way you charge your phone forever.

Another benefit of MagSafe technology is that it allows you to use your phone while it is charging. This is especially useful for those who are always on the go and need to charge their phones while using them. With MagSafe technology, you can browse the internet, make calls or send messages while your phone charges, eliminating the need to pause your activities or put them on hold.

MagSafe technology, in combination with the iPhone 13 Pros and Pro Max's improved battery life, makes it possible for you to go longer periods without charging your phone. This is a significant relief for those who have to carry their charging cables with them everywhere they go.

In conclusion, the new iPhone 13 Pros and Pro Max offer a revolutionary solution to your charging woes. With MagSafe technology, you can charge your phone wirelessly, eliminating the need for cables. You can also use your phone while it charges, making it more convenient to charge your phone on the go. MagSafe technology is a significant improvement from previous charging methods, and Apple has made it accessible to their users without compromising on the phone's design or functionality.

## Chosen Solution
 In search of a lighting cable port for the pro max but all you seel is the one for the pro is that compatible with the pro max

 The iPhone 13 pro’s charge port has a shorter flex than the pro MAX so I wouldn’t expect it to fit.
