## Chosen Solution
 Hello.
I recently had to replace the earpiece speaker of my LCD Q6, since it was rumbling a bit.
After replacement, the backlight of the device doesn’t work.
I have inspected the LCD cable since I expect the backlight to be connected with the LCD cable to the motherboard and it looks nice and undamaged.
Please note, that the LCD and touch works perfectly- just the backlight doesn’t.
When I turn the phone on, the screen is quite dark. I’d say it’s around 20% of maximum brightness, but after half a sec it gets completely dark, as if the backlight didn’t shine at all.
Changing brightness settings and hard resetting the phone didn’t help. I have also unplugged and re-plugged the lcd connector a couple of times with no success.
Is there anything I can do?
Take a look at this video. If you look precisely, you can see the screen go a little bit brighter the few milliseconds after boot.
  
Sorry for the video being so dark. For obvious reasons it’s hard to record a screen with broken backlight.
@edit

I have noticed that the LCD flex cable is actually a bit touched. Please take a look at the photo. Do I have to replace the whole LCD now? It feels so pointless…

 @szustarol
it does look like an LCD/ribbon cable issue. Replace the display and re-evaluate.
