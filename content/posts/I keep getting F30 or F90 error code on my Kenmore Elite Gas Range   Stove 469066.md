Title: Is Your Kenmore Elite Gas Range Stove Haunted? Discover the Shocking Truth Behind the F30 and F90 Error Codes!

Introduction:

Kenmore Elite Gas Range Stoves are popular for their efficient cooking and baking results. However, some customers face frequent issues of faulty F30 and F90 error codes. These particular error codes can create a panic among homeowners and make them feel like their stove is haunted or possessed by some supernatural forces. In this article, we will address these error codes in detail and reveal the shocking truth about their causes and solutions.

Body:

The F30 and F90 error codes in Kenmore Elite Gas Range Stoves represent different issues that require immediate attention. Let's explore the reasons behind them:

F30 Error Code:

The F30 error code indicates an issue with the temperature sensor in your stove. This sensor detects the temperature inside your oven and sends signals to the control panel to regulate it. If the temperature sensor is faulty or damaged, it can cause the temperature to become inaccurate, leading to burned or undercooked food. Moreover, it can also cause the oven to shut down completely.

Solution:

To resolve the issue, you need to check the temperature sensor and its wiring. Turn off the power supply and disconnect the sensor wires from the control board. Use a multimeter to check the resistance level of the sensor. The reading should be around 1100 ohms at room temperature. If the reading is below or above this level, it means that the sensor is faulty and needs to be replaced.

F90 Error Code:

The F90 error code indicates a problem with the door lock mechanism of your stove. This lock ensures that the oven door is securely closed during the cooking process to prevent accidents or injuries. If the door lock doesn't engage properly, the stove may not start or may shut down unexpectedly.

Solution:

To fix the issue, you need to check the door lock switch and the wiring connectors. Turn off the power supply and remove the back panel of the stove. Locate the door lock switch at the center of the door latch assembly and check its continuity with a multimeter. If the switch is faulty, replace it with a new one. Also, check the wiring connectors for any damages or loose connections and fix them accordingly.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the F30 and F90 error codes in Kenmore Elite Gas Range Stoves are not supernatural occurrences but rather very common issues that many homeowners face. The causes of these issues are simple but can significantly impact the performance of your stove. It is recommended to seek professional assistance from a certified technician if you are not confident about handling electrical components. Ignoring these error codes can lead to potential safety hazards and damage to your stove, which can be more expensive to repair. In summary, stay calm and take a logical approach to address these error codes to enjoy scrumptious meals with your Kenmore Elite Gas Range Stove.


## Chosen Solution
 Tried to preheat oven and getting a F30 code or F90 code.

 JoAnn, I can not get an F30 code, so I am noit sure about that. The F90 is the door lock code. this can be precluded by a self cleaning cycle:-) Try to unplug the range, wait 1 minute. Turn the range back on, while holding in on the oven door, start another self clean. Wait 2 minutes and then cancel the self clean. Do not release the door until the door lock light goes out. You can also try it this way, open the oven door and with one hand hold the doorswitch button in....do not let go of it...then with the other hand try to start a self clean cycle, then after one minute cancel the self clean, and wait about one more minute to let go of the button you are holding in on the door switch. You can find more information on here. Hope this helps, good luck.
