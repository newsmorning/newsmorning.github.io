Title: The Strange Case of the Bose Wave Radio AW1-1W CD Player that Spins but Doesn't Play

In the world of audio equipment, Bose has carved a niche for itself by producing high-quality, sleek-looking products that deliver an exceptional listening experience. One of such products is the Bose Wave Radio AW1-1W, a compact and stylish radio with a CD player. However, some owners of this device have reported a strange issue - the CD player spins continuously without playing any music. So, what's going on? Let's dive in and find out.

To understand why the Bose Wave Radio AW1-1W CD player is spinning but not playing, we need to look at how CD players work. In a typical CD player, when you insert a CD, the disc spins while the laser reads the digital data from the pits and bumps on the disc's surface. The CD player then converts this data into an analogue sound signal that is sent to the amplifier and speakers for playback. However, if the CD player fails to read the digital data, it may keep spinning the disc without playing any music.

Now, let's come back to the Bose Wave Radio AW1-1W CD player. The most likely cause of the spinning-but-not-playing issue is a dirty or damaged laser lens. The laser lens is a small, clear plastic component that sits inside the CD player and focuses the laser beam onto the CD's surface. Over time, dust, dirt, and grime can accumulate on the lens, making it harder for it to read the data on the CD. Similarly, scratches, smudges, or other physical damage to the lens can also render it ineffective.

To fix this issue, you can try cleaning the laser lens using a lens-cleaning disc or a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace the laser lens altogether, which can be a tricky process as it involves opening up the CD player and accessing the inner components.

Another possible cause of the spinning-but-not-playing issue is a fault in the CD motor or drive mechanism. The motor is responsible for spinning the CD while the drive mechanism moves the laser assembly back and forth to read the data. If any of these components are malfunctioning, the CD player may keep spinning without playing any music. In such cases, you may need to seek professional repair services or replace the entire CD player.

In conclusion, if you own a Bose Wave Radio AW1-1W CD player that's spinning but not playing, don't panic. It's a common issue that can be resolved with some troubleshooting and careful handling. Try cleaning the laser lens first, and if that doesn't work, consider seeking professional help. With a little patience and diligence, you can get your CD player back to its optimal performance and enjoy your favorite tunes once again.

## Chosen Solution
 My Bose Wave Radio/CD (2000) CD player stopped working.  It will not recognize new cd’s. I have carefully cleaned the cd, use a CD cleaner and the lense (with rubbing alcohol - from another suggestion).  I have replaced the 9V battery and unplugged the unit.   When I hit the play button it displays the time and CD TRACK  1 for a few seconds and “dISC” and CD flashes.  The other features (radio, alarm) work well.
Any suggestions?

 So, I think the first question is whether it is still playing your “old” CDs.  Sometimes “new” CDs are formatted differently such as CD-R or CD-RW with burned music.  If so, the newer format may not be compatible with a player from 2000.
