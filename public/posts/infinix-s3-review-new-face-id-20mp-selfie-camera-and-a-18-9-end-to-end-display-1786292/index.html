New Face ID, 20MP Selfie Camera, and End-to-End Display - Game Changer?!\nInfinix is back with a bang, launching its latest smartphone, the Infinix S3, which is packed with exciting features, including a 20MP selfie camera, face ID, and end-to-end display. The new flagship could pose a game-changer in the smartphone market with its sleek design and impressive camera system.\nThe Infinix S3 offers an impressive combination of features, making it a force to reckon with in a highly competitive market. The phone boasts an end-to-end display, the first of its kind on an Infinix device, making it easy to enjoy videos and games on a full-screen display. The display is HD and offers sharp images that look great from any angle.\nOne of the biggest selling points of the Infinix S3 is its 20MP selfie camera. This feature ensures that users have access to high-quality selfies, even in low light conditions. The camera comes with a dual LED flash that ensures that the quality of the photo is still top-notch when taken in darker environments.\nAnother exciting feature of the Infinix S3 is its face ID system. With this feature, users can effortlessly unlock their phone with their face, making it easier than inputting passwords or using fingerprint scanners. The face ID system is accurate and can recognize the user’s face in milliseconds, adding an extra layer of security to the device.\nThe Infinix S3 also comes with a powerful octa-core processor, ensuring that the device runs smoothly without lagging or freezing. This feature is particularly useful for avid gamers, as it ensures that they can play their favorite games without experiencing any lag or delays.\nThe Infinix S3 is also equipped with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage, ensuring that users have access to ample space to store their photos, videos, and other important files.

The new flagship has the potential to revolutionize the smartphone market with its sleek design and advanced camera system. With the features mentioned above, Infinix S3 is definitely a game-changer that you wouldn’t want to miss.\nSummary The Infinix S3 succeeds the famous S2 with a few changes in design, build material and aspect ratio. It is still an amazing phone with the standard specs we expected like 3GB RAM, 32GB ROM and the new xOS. To spice it up they even added Face ID so you can unlock your phone just by looking at it.\nThe new end to end display, upgraded battery, face ID, new camera features and expandable memory make it a must have if you are considering getting a new device. We took sometime with device and now bring you our review the Infinix S3.\nInfinix S3 Unboxing: What’s in the box? The S3 box is Aqua green and looks just like the S2 but slightly bigger with a twinkling star design on the box. When you open it, the S3 is on top with accessories under it in different compartments and trays. Here is what is in the box.\nInfinix S3 Power adapter/ charger head Micro USB cable Earphones SIM card tray pin Phone jacket User guide Warranty Card Infinix S3 Official Specs Announced: 2018, Feb Available: 2018, Mar Model: Hot S X573 Colours: Sandstone Black, Brush Gold, Baby Blue SIM: Dual Nano-SIM+SD Card OS: XOS Hummingbird based on Android Oreo Network: 4G: LTE/CSFB/ 3G:WCDMA/HSPA/HSPA+/ 2G: GPRS/FULL EDGE Dimensions: 72.85 x 153 x 8.4mm Weight: 150g Display: 5.7″HD (18:9) 720 x 1440 pixel IPS LCD Capacitive Touchscreen CPU: 1.4GHz Octa-core Qualcomm SD430 Processor Memory: 3GB RAM+32GB ROM expandable up to 128GB Camera: Front: 20MP FF (5120×3840) Dual flash, Rear: 13MP AF (4160×3120) Dual-flash, Video [email protected] Connectivity: WiFi IEEE 802.11 b/g/n, Hotspot Sensors: G-sensor, Ambient Light Sensor, E-Compass, Proximity Sensor, Gyroscope, Accelerometer Battery: Non-Removable Li-Po 4000mAh battery\nWhat’s New? 18:9 display 20MP Selfie camera Qualcomm SD430 Processor Dedicated Slot for Memory Expansion New XOS Hummingbird Poly-carbonate body Face ID (Available after Update) Bigger Battery than the S2 Pro The Design The new Infinix S3 design features the new 18:9 display giving you more screen real estate compared to the former 16:9 aspect ratio. The new longer larger-ish display is what you notice first when you power on the S3. Infinix doesnt mention it but an Indian tech blog mentions that the S3 has an 80% screen to body ratio even if they still maintain a frame to support the display.\nThey also removed the imprinted navigation buttons and replaced them with on screen navigation ones which you can hide when not in use. On the top side is the earpiece, a dual LED front flash plus the 20MP selfie camera.\nOn the left hand side is the SIM card tray while on the right side is the power button and volume buttons. The power button was given some texture to enable you different between them.\nThe bottom side has the USB charger port in the center with the mouth piece.mic to the left and the speaker to the right. The top side has only the 3.5mm headphone jack. The backside houses a protruding camera with a dual LED flash at the top left corner, a fingerprint scanner at the top middle while below the fingerprint scanner is the Infinix logo.\nThe poly-carbonate finish of the S3 feels more like a downgrade considering the S2 Pro has a full metal uni-body design. it will boil down to preference and the pros and cons of a metal uni-body versus plastic poly-carbonate.\nxOS The S3 comes with the new XOS Hummingbird which is an update from the previous XOS Chameleon. At the time of getting the device, there was an available update that promised to add the “Face ID” feature, Improve battery life, optimize camera effect, fix some system stability issues and a couple of security patches.\nWe downloaded and successfully installed the update. Other than Face ID, there wasnt much visually to the update even when Infinix is calling it a visual upgrade. Most of what they are saying you can do with the OS upgrade is either not there or was already previously possible.\nIn the new OS, Infinix has removed or re-purposed some of its X-Family of apps. The XCloud, Xhide, XManager and XSecurity have been removed and do not feature on the S3. XManager has been turned into “Phone Master” while most of the functionality of the apps has been changed. For Infinix die-hards, XCloud, Xhide and XSecurity were useful apps which they will no-longer enjoy.\nThe Infinix S3 Camera The S3 camera is the usual with nothing new except a few new features. It comes with 4 modes; panorama, night, time lapse and professional. The Pro mode was able to give us control over aspects like the shutter speed, ISO, metering, exposure value, white balance and even focusing. For an amateur or professional photographer, this is amazing news.\nThe settings allow you to change photo size and scale, add or remove shutter sound, water mark your photos among others.\nThe new interesting camera feature is the time lapse that allows you to shoot interesting videos in an almost fast forward kind of way.\nWhat is worth noting is the 20MP selfie camera since a lot of life is about selfies these days. From out testing we noticed that the S3 selfie camera can help you achieve blurred backgrounds which give the photos a nice look and feel. We actually failed to achieve the same effect with the iPhone 6Plus.\nUnfortunately, they removed the Wefie camera we had grown to love on the Infinix S2.\nBattery We didnt get a chance to full test out the Infinix S3 battery but we love the power upgrade from 3000 to 4000 mAh. We also noticed that just like the S2, it charges slightly faster even there’s no mention of fast charge as a feature. It took about an hour to go from 0-100% charge.\nThe S3 also features a battery save mode that optimizes your battery performance by killing battery consuming features like Bluetooth, WiFi or internet.\nWith heavy usage, we were able to squeeze between 6-8 hours on average. We also notice that as time goes by smartphone batteries deteriorate but usually by that time, many have replaced their devices with new ones.\nWhat we liked Bigger battery 18:9 display Dedicated Memory Slot What we didn’t like No more WeFie Camera. This sucks! Plastic Poly-carbonate body Removed X-Family Apps S3 Price + Where to buy The Infinix S3 is going for the price of Ugx 680,000 at Infinix stores countrywide. In Kampala, Infinix devices can be purchased at Banana Phone world Lugogo Mall, Nandos, Kampala Boulevard. They also have Infinix dealerships most of which are located between Kampala and Jinja Road.\nBottom Line We loved the device though we particularly hate that they removed the Wefie camera. That said, the new 16:9 display, exciting features, amazing selfie camera, affordable price and functional after sales support make this an amazing deal.\nIf you are looking for a smartphone to buy, this is your device. But if you want to upgrade from your current device, may be you should wait just a little longer for infinix’s later releases this year.\nRelated ","wordCount":"1586","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emma Getz"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/infinix-s3-review-new-face-id-20mp-selfie-camera-and-a-18-9-end-to-end-display-1786292/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe What Infinix S3 Just Upgraded!

We actually failed to achieve the same effect with the iPhone 6Plus.</p><p>Unfortunately, they removed the Wefie camera we had grown to love on the Infinix S2.</p><h2 id=battery>Battery<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#battery>#</a></h2><p>We didnt get a chance to full test out the Infinix S3 battery but we love the power upgrade from 3000 to 4000 mAh. We also noticed that just like the S2, it charges slightly faster even there’s no mention of fast charge as a feature. It took about an hour to go from 0-100% charge.</p><p>The S3 also features a battery save mode that optimizes your battery performance by killing battery consuming features like Bluetooth, WiFi or internet.</p><p>With heavy usage, we were able to squeeze between 6-8 hours on average. We also notice that as time goes by smartphone batteries deteriorate but usually by that time, many have replaced their devices with new ones.</p><h2 id=what-we-liked>What we liked<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-we-liked>#</a></h2><ul><li>Bigger battery</li><li>18:9 display</li><li>Dedicated Memory Slot</li></ul><h2 id=what-we-didnt-like>What we didn’t like<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-we-didnt-like>#</a></h2><ul><li>No more WeFie Camera.

In Kampala, Infinix devices can be purchased at Banana Phone world Lugogo Mall, Nandos, Kampala Boulevard. They also have Infinix dealerships most of which are located between Kampala and Jinja Road.</p><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom Line<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bottom-line>#</a></h2><p>We loved the device though we particularly hate that they removed the Wefie camera. That said, the new 16:9 display, exciting features, amazing selfie camera, affordable price and functional after sales support make this an amazing deal.</p><p>If you are looking for a smartphone to buy, this is your device. But if you want to upgrade from your current device, may be you should wait just a little longer for infinix’s later releases this year.</p><h3 id=related>Related<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#related>#</a></h3></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/home-button-only-work-after-screen-lights-up-iphone-6s-1406226/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>You Won't Believe How This Simple Trick Fixes Your iPhone 6S Home Button Issue!</span></a>
