## Introduction
 
This replacement is necessary for any car owner because the rear brake not only signifies when you are breaking while driving but also makes the car more visible at night. Not replacing this light can lead to more significant issues, such as miscommunication on the highway when driving.
 
When opening the new lightbulb from the package, wear gloves and avoid touching the lightbulb with your bare hands. If done so, the light bulb's life span will not last as long as mentioned on the packaging.
