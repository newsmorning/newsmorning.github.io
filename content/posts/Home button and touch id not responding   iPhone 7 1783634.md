Is Your iPhone 7 Suddenly Unresponsive? Here's How to Fix the Home Button and Touch ID!

The Home button and Touch ID are two of the most critical features of an iPhone 7, but they can sometimes malfunction, leaving you with a phone that's unresponsive. If you're facing such a problem, don't worry; there are several things you can do to fix it.

Here are a few things you can do to fix your iPhone 7 Home button and Touch ID:

1. Restart your phone

A simple restart may be all your phone needs to fix its Home button and Touch ID. Press and hold the power button for a few seconds until you see the "slide to power off" screen. Slide the red power icon to turn off your phone, and then press and hold the power button again to turn it back on.

2. Update your iOS software

Sometimes, your iPhone 7 Home button and Touch ID may stop working due to issues with your device's iOS software. To fix this, check for any software updates on your phone by going to Settings > General > Software Update. If an update is available, download and install it.

3. Check your Touch ID settings

If Touch ID isn't working on your iPhone 7, it might be disabled on your device. Go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and make sure that the Touch ID feature is enabled. Also, check if the fingerprint scanner recognized your fingerprint correctly.

4. Calibrate your Home button

The Home button on your iPhone 7 can sometimes lose calibration, which can make it unresponsive. To calibrate your Home button, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button and select the option to "Calibrate Home Button."

5. Use AssistiveTouch

If all else fails, use the AssistiveTouch feature on your iPhone 7. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch and turn it on. A virtual button will appear on your screen, acting as your Home button. You can also use it to access other iPhone features.

Final thoughts

Your iPhone 7's Home button and Touch ID are some of the essential features you use every day. If they suddenly stop working, try the steps above to get them working again. If the problem persists, you may need to contact Apple Support or visit an authorized repair center for assistance.

## Chosen Solution
 whilst cleaning charge port 99% isopropyl alcohol must have seeped into the phone opened up and well cleaned and dried phone powers back up but lost touch id and home button function HELP… tryed heat gun all over phone but no luck

 Try disconnecting then reconnecting the screen ensuring the connectors go on properly. There are 2 connectors in the middle right side of the screen, the Home Button connector one is the smaller, shorter lengthened one.
if that doesn’t work, make sure the home button connector is attached to the screen, it’s under the home button plate.
Finally there’s a chance you could have damaged the flex cable that connects the home button to the screen. You can try installing a new screen on.
