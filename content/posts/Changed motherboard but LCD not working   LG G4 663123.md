You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed the Motherboard on My LG G4 - The LCD Just Stopped Working!

I had been using my LG G4 for more than two years and loved every bit of it. The phone worked like a charm, except for some occasional lag, battery drainage, and overheating issues. Last month, I decided to upgrade the phone's motherboard to fix the problems once and for all.

I researched online, watched some YouTube tutorials, and finally ordered a brand new motherboard from a reliable vendor. I followed the instructions carefully, removed the old motherboard, and installed the new one. Everything seemed to be going well until I turned on the phone.

To my horror, the LCD display didn't light up. I tried hard resetting the phone, but nothing worked. I tried swapping the old motherboard, and the display came back to life, but the phone didn't function properly. I was perplexed and decided to seek professional help.

I took my LG G4 to the nearest phone repair shop and told them what had happened. They ran a diagnostic test on the phone and discovered that the new motherboard was defective. It had a faulty circuit that prevented the LCD from functioning correctly. They advised me to replace the motherboard with another one or continue using the old one if it still worked.

I was devastated. I had spent a considerable amount of money on the new motherboard, and it had turned out to be a total waste. I felt frustrated, helpless, and cheated. I wondered if it was just my bad luck, or if many other LG G4 users had faced similar issues while changing their motherboards.

After doing some research, I found out that many people had experienced LCD-related problems after replacing the motherboard on their LG G4. Some had noticed a dim display, others had seen distorted images, and some had dealt with total blackouts of the screen. Most of them had to revert back to the old motherboard as they couldn't find a replacement for the faulty one.

I learned that the problems arose mainly due to incompatibility issues with the new motherboard, faulty circuitry, and problems with the connectors. I also found out that there was no guaranteed fix for the issue, and the consequences could be severe if one tried to experiment with the phone's hardware without proper knowledge and training.

In conclusion, changing the motherboard of an LG G4 might seem like a logical solution to fix problems, but it can go awry if one isn't careful. It is essential to research thoroughly, choose a reputable vendor, and seek professional help if necessary. It is also advisable to back up one's data before attempting any hardware changes and to be prepared for any unexpected issues that may arise. Remember, the cost of a new motherboard is significant, but the value of one's data and personal information is priceless.

Any one has any idea before I go and get the new LCD  for it ??
Thank you

 @shahram71 since everything else seems to be working for you, I'd go with a new display assembly. It is of course possible that this is a board error but you can rule it out with a new display. If it still wont work with a new one then you know you have trouble with your new motherboard (unlikely).
