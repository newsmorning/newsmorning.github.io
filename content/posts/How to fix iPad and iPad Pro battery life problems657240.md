Are You Tired of Your iPad Dying Too Quickly? Here's the Ultimate Solution!

iPads are some of the most versatile and multifunctional gadgets you can get your hands on these days. From playing games and streaming movies to browsing the web and creating professional designs, there's no limit to what you can achieve with your iPad. However, one of the most frustrating things about these powerful devices is their limited battery life. It's never fun to be in the middle of something important on your iPad only to have it die on you unexpectedly.

But don't worry, as frustrating as it may seem, you don't have to put up with a short battery life. There are several things you can do to help extend the life of your iPad's battery and ultimately save yourself the hassle of having to recharge it regularly. Here are some tips to help you maximize your iPad's battery life and make it last longer:

Turn off unnecessary features

One of the easiest things you can do to conserve your iPad's battery life is to turn off any features or applications you are not using. For example, if you're not using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular data, turn them off. Similarly, turn off any apps that are not in use or that are running in the background.

Reduce Screen Brightness

Another simple way to conserve your battery is to reduce the screen brightness. High-resolution displays can be very demanding on the battery, so by reducing the brightness, you can make a significant difference in how long your battery will last. You can adjust the brightness level settings by going to "Settings" and "Display & Brightness."

Manage Battery Usage

With the latest versions of iOS, you can check which applications use the most battery power. You can also see which apps run in the background and turn them off if they're not essential. To access this feature, go to "Settings," then "Battery." Here you can see the battery usage by apps and turn off the background app refresh.

Power-Saving Mode 

Your iPad comes with a power-saving mode that automatically reduces power consumption when your battery level is low. To turn on this feature, go to "Settings" then "Battery," and switch on the Low Power mode. This feature automatically reduces the brightness of the display, limits some visual effects, and turns off automatic downloads.

Use A Quality Charger

Another factor that could affect your iPad's battery life is the type and quality of charger you use. Cheap or inferior charging cables can cause your iPad to charge slowly or not at all, and they can also damage your battery. So, it's essential to use good quality charging cables and power adapters that are recommended by Apple.

In conclusion, if you're tired of your iPad's battery life dying too quickly, it's time to take action. By following the tips mentioned above, you can help extend your iPad's battery life, so you can enjoy using it for longer periods without the hassle of having to recharge it regularly. With a little effort, you can enjoy long-lasting battery life that will take the stress out of using your iPad.

If you use your smartphone or tablet constantly to browse, chat, use social media, it is natural for the battery to drain quickly. If you are using an older device, these issues can get magnified, due to the usage over time.
 
However, if you are having battery drainage issues with your new iPad Pro, then it is a major concern. The issue might have occurred after you restored a backup from your old iPad. If that’s the case, then you don’t need to worry.
 
In this post, we have listed ways to resolve iPad and iPad Pro battery health issues. 
 
There are a lot of reasons for battery draining faster than ever. It could be installing an update to your iOS, restoring a backup, downloading apps, games and other content. One of the reasons could be Wi-Fi radio turned on, Spotlight indexes everything. If the vitals are turned on and a device is working in the background, the power is consumed.

Note: For new iPad Pro 2018, as there is no Home button, powering it off is a challenge. Press the Sleep button along with either Volume button.
 
Step 2: Hold down the buttons when the screen turns off.
 
Step 3: Release the buttons when you see the Apple logo.
 
Now iPad is rebooted, use the device as previous and check if the battery drains in the same way, if yes then move on to the next step!
 
### Check Usage
 
If the previous step is not able to resolve the issue, let’s check which services and apps are using the battery and how it is consumed. To do that follow these steps:
 
- Locate Settings from Home screen on your iPad.
 - Navigate to Battery and tap on it. It will show how your battery is consumed.
 - Locate Show Detailed Usage button to see the bifurcation of background and foreground power usage.
 - You can also see the battery consumption in the last 7 days in detail.

 
Scroll down to see which app is using the most. Check the list, let’s say if you saw iCloud Photo Library and you have just upgraded or restored the backup, so if you are downloading things, then the battery consumption would be normal once the work is done!
 
If you see Instagram in the list, it says 5% on screen and 35% in the background, that means, something is seriously wrong.
 
So, you can force quit any of such app, to make things work normally. To do that, follow these steps:
 
- Press the Home button twice to bring the app switcher.
 - Swipe and locate the app you want to force quit.
 - Touch the app screen and swipe up to remove the app.

 
You can also consider reinstalling the app if the app still misbehaves.
 
### For iPad Pro 2018
 
To force quit your apps on iPad Pro 2018, follow these steps:
 
- Swipe up and hold to get access to multitasking screen.
 - Locate the app that you want to force quit.
 - Swipe up on the app and it’s done

 
If this doesn’t work, then move to the next step!
 
### Restore: 
 
If you have restored a backup from an iPhone to iPad, and things don’t go well, it could create an issue as well. You need to set up the iPad Pro as new. Though it is a lot to do, entering passwords, customizing settings but this could make your iPad battery perform better.
 
In order to do, follow these steps:
 
Note: Before starting, you need to take a backup of information and data stored on your iPad. Also, you need to make sure you have the latest version of iTunes.
 
Step 1: Launch iTunes on PC or Mac. You can’t get access to your computer, but your device works, then you can delete and restore your device without any computer.
 
Step 2: Connect your Apple iOS device to computer using a cable. The device will prompt you to either enter the passcode or will ask whether the computer could be trusted.
 
Step 3: Select your Apple device which appears on iTunes
 
Step 4: Go to Summary and Click Restore.
 
Step 5: You need to click on Restore one more time to confirm. iTunes erases the data and does a clean install
 
Step 6: Once the device is restored to factory settings, it will restart. Now you need to set it up as new.
 
### Customize Settings on iPad To Fix Battery Consumption Issues
 
Brightness on your iPad could be the culprit. You can tone it down and customize a few settings to resolve the issue.
 
- Reduce the screen brightness.
 - Disable Background Refresh for apps.
 - Enable Auto-Lock and set it to 1 minute.
 - Disable push for mail and use fetch instead.
 - Disable Lock screen notifications, this will stop the lighting up of iPad’s display.
 - It is advised to use headphones if you are watching a video or listening to audio.

 
### Contact Apple
 
If nothing worked so far, it is better to take your device to the Apple store and get your device fixed. You can also call 1-800-MY-APPLE & order mail-in-repair to get your device repaired.
