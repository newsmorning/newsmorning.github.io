# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Replace Your HP Pavilion 360 Screen - Find Out Now!

If you have been struggling with a cracked or broken screen on your HP Pavilion 360, you might be surprised to learn just how easy it is to replace. With just a few simple steps and some basic tools, you can have a brand new screen up and running in no time.

Before you begin, you will need to gather a few supplies. You will need a replacement screen that matches the size and resolution of your existing display, a set of screwdrivers, and a plastic pry tool or spudger.

Step 1: Remove the Bezel

The first step in replacing your screen is to remove the bezel around the display. Start by shutting down your computer and unplugging it from any power sources. Then, use your pry tool or spudger to carefully separate the bezel from the screen. Work your way around the edge of the bezel until it is completely detached.

Step 2: Disconnect the Screen

With the bezel removed, you should be able to see the LCD screen and the wire connections that power it. Disconnect these wires by carefully removing the connector on the back of the display.

Step 3: Remove the Screws

Use your screwdrivers to remove the screws that hold the screen in place. These are typically located around the edges of the display, and there may be several of them.

Step 4: Install the New Screen

With the old screen removed, it's time to install the new one. Carefully position the new screen in the proper location, and replace the screws that hold it in place. Then, reconnect the wire connectors to power it up.

Step 5: Reattach the Bezel

Once the new screen is installed and working properly, it's time to reattach the bezel. Carefully align the edges and snap it back into place.

That's it! With just a few simple steps and some basic tools, you can replace the screen on your HP Pavilion 360 and get back to using it like new. And the best part is that you can save hundreds of dollars by doing it yourself instead of taking it to an expensive repair shop.

So if you have been putting off fixing your broken screen, there's no need to wait any longer. Use these simple steps to get your laptop up and running again, and enjoy all the benefits of a brand new display.
