Revive Your Slow Laptop in Seconds: A Secret Trick to Unlock Your GPU and Boost Performance!

Are you often frustrated with your laptop's slow performance, especially when running high-demanding applications like games or design software? Do you feel that your laptop's hardware specs are underutilized, and you're not getting the maximum value for your investment?

If that's the case, you're not alone. Many laptop users face the same dilemma, as most laptops come with integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) that share resources with the central processing unit (CPU). This means that when you run graphically-intensive programs, the CPU and GPU have to compete for resources, leading to bottlenecking and slow performance.

However, there's a secret trick that can unlock your laptop's GPU and boost its performance in seconds, without any additional hardware or software. The trick is called "eGPU passthrough," and it involves redirecting your laptop's graphics output to an external GPU, freeing up resources and unlocking more processing power.

To use eGPU passthrough, you need a laptop with a Thunderbolt 3 port, which is the latest and fastest data transfer standard for laptops. You also need an external GPU enclosure, which is a box that houses a high-performance graphics card, and a compatible graphics card itself. You can find eGPU enclosures and graphics cards from popular brands like Razer, AORUS, and ASUS.

Once you have your eGPU setup, the next step is to enable eGPU passthrough on your laptop's BIOS. This process may vary depending on your laptop's brand and model, so it's best to consult the manufacturer's documentation or user forums. In general, you need to enable Thunderbolt 3 boot support and set the eGPU as the primary graphics adapter.

After enabling eGPU passthrough, you can connect your external GPU enclosure to your Thunderbolt 3 port and install the graphics card drivers on your laptop. Once you've done that, you can run your graphically-intensive applications as usual, but now with the added horsepower of the external GPU.

The results can be staggering. You can see up to a 300% increase in graphics performance, which means smoother gameplay, faster rendering, and more responsive UI. You can also run multiple monitors and higher resolutions without any lag or stuttering.

In conclusion, eGPU passthrough is a secret trick that can revive your slow laptop in seconds and unlock its full potential. By redirecting your graphics output to an external GPU, you can free up resources and boost your performance, without having to upgrade your laptop's hardware or invest in a new gaming rig. While eGPU passthrough may require some technical know-how and investment, it's a game-changing solution for anyone who demands more from their laptop.

The Graphics Processing Unit is a module of your PC which helps render high-end graphics on your PC’s screen while watching a movie, playing a game, or using graphics applications. If your laptop is not using a dedicated GPU, then you will experience a compromised quality. Here are the steps to fix a laptop not using GPU.
 
## How to Fix Laptop Not Using GPU
 
### Method 1: Install Windows Updates
 
The first method to fix GPU issues in a laptop not using a dedicated GPU is to update the computer. Microsoft releases frequent updates to patch software anomalies along with security updates to ensure your Windows PC remains safe and secure while delivering optimal performance. Here are the steps to update Windows:
 
Step 1: Press Windows + I on your keyboard to open the Settings window.
 
Step 2: Click on Updates & Security option.
 

 
Step 3: Now click on the Check For Updates button and wait until the process completes.
 
Step 4: Do restart the computer after the process ends to make sure that the changes take effect.
 
With your Windows OS updated, you can check the performance of your games and find out if your GPU is working properly.
 
### Method 2: Update BIOS
 
Another method to fix laptop GPUs not being utilized up to their full potential is to check and update your BIOS. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
Step 1: Boot into your BIOS by restarting your computer and pressing the right key as per your PC’s documentation. This key is different for different brand manufacturers and is generally from F9 to F12 or the DEL key.
 
Step 2: Locate Chipset options and look for Dedicated GPU Configuration.
 
Step 3: Ensure that this option is set to Enabled. If not, then enable it and this resolves the laptop not using GPU error.
 
Step 4: If the option was already enabled or missing, then you could update your BIOS by visiting the motherboard’s manufacturer website and downloading the latest update. After the BIOS has been updated, you can enter this environment again and enable the Dedicated GPU option.
 
### Method 3: Alter Windows Graphic Settings
 
Modifying the current graphic settings can also enable the GPU in your PC. Here are the steps to fix this issue.
 
Note: Updating the BIOS is a bit tricky and a technical step. Ensure that you read all the relevant documentation on the website and perform the steps only if you know what you are doing. Else you can take the help of a local technician to sort this out.
 
Step 1: Make a right-click on any space on your desktop and click on Display Settings from the context menu.
 
Step 2: A new window will open where you have to click on the Display option in the left pane.
 
Step 3: Scroll down in the right pane and locate Graphics Settings.
 
Step 4: Under Graphics Performance Preference, choose the type of app (Microsoft or Desktop) and then click on the browse button to select the application with low graphics and performance issues.
 
Step 5: Once the app is selected, click on the Options button and then click on the High-Performance option followed by a click on the Save button
 
### Method 4: Enable GPU manually
 
Windows OS uses the integrated GPU settings by default to save power and resources. But this could hamper the gaming experience and this requires using a dedicated GPU for optimal performance. Here are the steps to fix laptop GPU issues and enable dedicated GPU.
 
### For an NVIDIA Graphics card
 
Step 1: Make a right-click on a space on your desktop and click on NVIDIA Control Panel from the context menu.
 
Step 2: A new window will open where you click on the Manage 3D Settings in the left panel.  Now select a High-performance NVIDIA processor from the dropdown menu under Preferred Graphics Processor in the right panel.
 
Step 3: Click on the Apply button to save changes.
 
Step 4: Now click on Set PhysX Configuration in the left panel.
 
Step 5: Move to the right panel and select your dedicated GPU from the dropdown menu under Select a PhysX processor
 
Step 6: Click on Apply and exit this window.
 
The NVIDIA dedicated GPU will not appear in the Task Manager Window.
 
### For an AMD Graphics card
 
Step 1: Right-click on the desktop and from the context menu, choose AMD Radeon Settings.
 
Step 2: A new window will open where you have to click on System Tab on the top-right corner.
 
Step 3: Now click on the Switchable Graphics and then select the program you want to run and Choose High Performance from the dropdown.
 
Step 4: Exit the window and launch the application and check if the graphics have improved.
 
#### The Final Word on How to Fix Laptop Not Using GPU
 
The above methods will help to fix your laptop not using a dedicated GPU and ensure that the performance improves while playing the game. If you don’t find success with the above methods then you could perhaps try updating your drivers by using a Driver Updater Application like Smart Driver Care. This application fixes all driver issues and ensures that smooth and flawless communication is established between your hardware and software. Updating drivers have been known to fix all minor issues, which occur all of a sudden, and the reason for which cannot be determined. Follow us on social media – Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.
