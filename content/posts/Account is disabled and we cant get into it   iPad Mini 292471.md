Title: You Won't Believe What Happened when We Tried to Access Our iPad Mini Account - It Was Disabled and We're Totally Locked Out!

Introduction:

Technology has made our lives easier, more connected, and efficient. However, sometimes things can go wrong, and we end up in a situation where we can't access our devices. This happened to us when we tried to access our iPad Mini account, and we found out that it was disabled. We were totally locked out of our account and couldn't figure out what went wrong. In this article, we'll share our experience and suggest some ways to avoid such a situation.

The Story:

We use our iPad Mini for personal and work purposes, so when we tried to access it, we were surprised to see the message that said: "Your iPad has been disabled, connect to iTunes." We didn't know what that meant and how to fix it, so we reached out to Apple support. We spent more than an hour waiting for the representative just to tell us that we would need to erase our device completely and restore it from a backup. That was not an ideal solution for us since we had important data on our device that we didn't want to lose.

We asked the representative what could have caused the issue, and he told us that there are several reasons why a device can be disabled, such as entering the wrong passcode multiple times or the iPad being remotely disabled by the owner via iCloud. We were sure that we didn't enter the wrong passcode several times, and we hadn't requested for our device to be disabled remotely.

Finally, after several attempts, we were able to restore our device, but we still didn't know what caused the issue. We later found out that one of the apps we had installed on our iPad Mini had a security flaw that allowed hackers to gain access to our device and disable it remotely. It was a scary situation, and we knew that we had to be more vigilant about the apps we install and the security measures we take.

Lessons Learned:

We learned several lessons from our experience. Firstly, always back up your device regularly to ensure that you don't lose any valuable data. Secondly, be mindful of the apps you download and install on your device. Only download apps from reputable sources, and read app reviews to make sure that they are safe and secure. Lastly, enable security features such as two-factor authentication, passcode lock, and Touch ID/Face ID to ensure that your device is secure.

Conclusion:

Being locked out of your iPad Mini account is a frustrating experience, but it can be prevented if you take the necessary security measures. Ensure that you back up your device regularly, be mindful of the apps you install, and enable security features. By doing so, you can ensure that your device is secure and you can prevent such a situation from happening again. Stay safe!

 Probably at the part where you input the Apple ID email when you choose the forgot password option on iCloud.com
OP did you mean iPad is disabled screen?
If yes, sometimes you can be lucky where it may not have an iCloud account attached to that device.
If there isn't any the iPad can be restored / reset without needing to enter that same iCloud account that was on there before.
Worst case you'll have to go to a genius bar (apple store) and get them to remove the apple id account that is causing the activation lock. You'll need proof of purchase in order to go that route.
