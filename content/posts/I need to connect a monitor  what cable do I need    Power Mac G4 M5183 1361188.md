## Chosen Solution
 I am trying to connect a monitor. I borrowed the acer monitor I use all the time but I get a no input error. Do I need a different cable? If so where are they available?  Thank youQ

 This is according to what video card you are using and what connectors it has.  It may have one or two.  Probably a VGA and DVI. If it is oval on both ends it may be an ADC.
