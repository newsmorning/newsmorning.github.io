This browser has a built-in ad blocker feature that helps you save data and load websites faster. In private browsing mode, once you close out the window, your history, cookies and form data are automatically deleted.\nConnecting to webpages through Opera’s VPN means that the shared data is encrypted and routed through a remote server. The encryption helps secure your data while the remote server diguises your IP address and location for more privacy.\nHow do I fix PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR? 1. Clear browser cache Firefox Click on the 3-line icon. Select Settings. From the left, select the Privacy \u0026 Security tab. Locate Cookies and Site data section. Hit the Clear data button. Check both Cookies and Site Data and Cached Web Content boxes that appear in the next window. Hit the Clear button. Chrome Click on the 3-dot menu icon. Select Settings. Select Privacy and Security from the left side. Click on Clear browsing data. Select the appropriate boxes but make sure to check the Cached images and file and Cookies and other site data boxes. Hit the Clear data button. 2. Uninstall any firewall or antivirus Open the Start menu. Search for Windows Defender Firewall and open it. From the left side, select the option Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off. For both Public and Private network setting select the Turn off Windows Defender Firewall option. Click on OK. We have explained the steps for Windows Defender Firewall.
