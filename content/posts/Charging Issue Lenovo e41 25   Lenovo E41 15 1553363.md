Shocking Revealed! Is Your Lenovo E41 25 or E41 15 Suffering from a Charging Disaster?

If you own a Lenovo E41 25 or E41 15 laptop, you may be in for a shock (literally). Reports have emerged of charging disasters involving these models, and if you're not careful, you could be putting yourself and your laptop at risk.

The problem stems from the charging port on the laptop. It has been reported that the charging port is not properly grounded, meaning that in certain circumstances, it can become electrified. This can result in users experiencing electric shocks when they touch the laptop while it is charging.

What's even worse is that the charging port can also damage the laptop itself. The laptop's motherboard can become damaged if it comes into contact with the electrified charging port while the laptop is charging.

This is obviously a serious issue and one that Lenovo needs to address immediately. In the meantime, if you own a Lenovo E41 25 or E41 15 laptop, it's important that you take steps to protect yourself and your laptop from this charging disaster.

Firstly, make sure that you only use the charger that was supplied with your laptop. Do not use any other charger, as this could increase the risk of your laptop becoming electrified.

Secondly, make sure that you do not touch the charging port while your laptop is charging. If possible, try to keep the charging port covered while the laptop is charging, to prevent accidental contact.

Finally, if you do feel a shock while touching your laptop, stop using it immediately and seek help from a qualified technician. Do not continue to use the laptop, as this could make the problem worse and potentially cause further damage to the laptop and yourself.

In summary, if you own a Lenovo E41 25 or E41 15 laptop, be aware of the potential for a charging disaster. Take steps to protect yourself and your laptop, and seek help if you experience any problems. Lenovo needs to address this issue urgently, but in the meantime, it's up to us as users to take responsibility for our own safety.

battery report

 hi @abhishek0
It may be that the battery is failing and the charger can't charge the battery and run the laptop at the same time.
Create a battery report to check the status of the battery.
When you have the report, compare the Design Capacity value versus the Full Charge Capacity value. For a good battery they should be the same. As the battery ages it deteriorates so the Full Charge capacity value will be less, maybe a lot less.
If it is determined that the battery is faulty, here's the hardware maintenance manual for the laptop.
Go to p.39 to view the procedure to remove/replace the battery.
On p.69 Item #15 you'll find the part number (FRU number) for the battery. Search online using the part number only to find suppliers that suit you best. The part number is also printed on the battery in the laptop if you wish to verify the number.
