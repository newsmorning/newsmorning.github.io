Title: Discover the Incredible Features of this DVD Player, But Be Wary of its Compatibility with PS3 Games

Would you believe that a DVD player could do more than just play your favorite movies and TV shows? This is exactly what you will experience when using this impressive DVD player. With features that are truly amazing, you will have a home entertainment powerhouse that will revolutionize your viewing experience.

Some of its incredible functions include its ability to play Blu-ray discs, DVDs and CDs, as well as being able to upscale non-HD content to give you an enhanced viewing experience. Additionally, you can also connect through HDMI or USB inputs to access content from other devices, such as a USB drive or media player. All of these functions come together to create a truly feature-packed media player that is essential for any home entertainment setup.

However, there is one area where this media player doesn't quite live up to expectations: its compatibility with PS3 games. If you're an avid gamer and have tried to use your PS3 games on this DVD player, you might have been disappointed. This is due to the fact that this player does not support the gaming capabilities of the PS3 console.

This might be a disappointment for some, particularly since the player has so many impressive features, but the truth is that this DVD player was not designed to be a gaming console. Its focus is on delivering high-quality video and audio content for your viewing pleasure.

While it's essential to understand that this DVD player might not offer support for PS3 games, it should not deter you from enjoying all the other excellent features that it offers. From its upscaling capabilities to its connectivity options, this media player packs so many useful functions to ensure your entertainment needs are met.

In conclusion, this DVD player is a robust and feature-packed media player that provides an incredible viewing and listening experience. While it might not be compatible with PS3 games, this flaw should not take away from the other outstanding features that it offers. So, what are you waiting for? Get yours today and enjoy all that this media player has to offer!

## Chosen Solution
 Just like the title says, reads dvds and blu rays just fine but I put in a game disc and nada, there is a slight click like right after it seems to read it but still nothing.

 This seems like a problem with the disc reader because the Blueray and game discs use different readers. You might want to look into it a little more because I am not sure, but try this  PlayStation 3 Slim Blu-ray Disc Drive Replacement

 You need to make sure if the console hasn't been repaired by someone else before. It is highly unlikely that it can read blu-ray but not games, this usually suggests swapped drive.
