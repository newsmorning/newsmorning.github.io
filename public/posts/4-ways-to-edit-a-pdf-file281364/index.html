PDF (Portable Document Format) files have become the standard for sharing and exchanging documents on the web. The format is widely used in schools, businesses, and other organizations as it is a reliable way to ensure that the layout, fonts, and images of your document will remain the same across different platforms.\nBut editing a PDF file can be a real headache. It requires a specialized software that can be costly and complicated. Luckily, there are some simple and effective tricks that you can use to edit your PDF files without having to purchase any new software. In this article, we will show you four easy ways to edit a PDF file.\nTrick 1: Use Google Docs Google Docs is a free online office suite that allows users to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. But did you know that you can also use Google Docs to edit PDF files?\nHere’s how you can do it:\nOpen your browser and navigate to the Google Docs website. Sign in with your Google account. Click on “New” in the upper-left corner of the screen. Select “File upload” and choose the PDF file that you want to edit. Open the file in Google Docs by clicking on it. Once the file is open, you can make the necessary changes using the editing tools provided by Google Docs. After you’ve made your edits, you can download the file as a PDF again and save it to your computer.\nTrick 2: Use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is a free PDF viewer that comes with a built-in editor that allows you to make several different types of edits to your PDF files. Here’s how to use it:\nOpen your PDF file in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. Click on the “Edit PDF” tool in the right-hand pane. Choose the type of edit you want to make from the toolbar – you can add text, images, and links, among other things. After you’ve made your changes, click on the “File” menu and choose “Save” to save the edited PDF file. Trick 3: Use Microsoft Word Microsoft Word is a popular word processing software that can also be used to edit PDF files. Here’s how:\nOpen Microsoft Word and click “File” \u003e “Open.” Choose the PDF file you want to edit and click “Open.” When prompted to convert the file, click “OK.” Make your desired changes to the document. Click “File” \u003e “Save as” and choose “PDF” from the drop-down menu. This method works best with PDF files that are mostly text-based, as it can be difficult to retain formatting and images.\nTrick 4: Use an Online PDF Editor Online PDF editors such as Smallpdf, PDFescape, and Sejda are great options if you don’t want to download any software to your computer. Here’s how to use one:\nOpen your browser and navigate to an online PDF editor. Upload your PDF file to the editor. Use the editing tools provided by the editor to make the changes you need. After you’ve made your edits, click the “Download” button to download the edited file to your computer. One thing to keep in mind is that online PDF editors rely on an internet connection, so if you don’t have a stable connection, you may experience difficulties using these editors.\nIn Conclusion Editing a PDF file doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With these simple tricks, you can make the necessary changes to your PDF file without having to spend a lot of money on software or spend hours learning how to use complicated software. Try out one of these methods and see how easy it can be to edit your PDF files!\nWhen John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe, developed the Portable Document Format (PDF), he wanted to make it easier for people to distribute documents without the need to print them. Surprisingly, it didn’t turn out to be very user-friendly.\nNot only were the files large in size, but the format didn’t support external hyperlinks and could only be viewed with a special PDF viewer. Over time, functional improvements were included in various versions of the PDF file format that made it easier to work with.\nHowever, it’s still not as easy to make changes to or edit a PDF document like most other text documents, because they weren’t really meant to be edited.\nMost PDFs start from a source file in another native format like Word, and are converted to the PDF file format for distribution. If you’re not the original author, it’ll be a little more difficult to edit the file either because the source file isn’t available to you, or you don’t have the right apps to edit it.\nThe good news is that there are several ways to edit a PDF document. We’re going to show you four great tools that make it possible.\nUsing Adobe Acrobat Adobe Acrobat is the most obvious tool for editing PDFs. Like most of Adobe’s offerings, you can easily get it online by purchasing the Standard or Pro versions of the editor.\nIf you don’t want to pay for it, you can sign up for the 7-day free trial and access Acrobat DC’s powerful features.\nTo start editing your PDF, you need to open the file in Adobe Acrobat.\nGo to File\u003eOpen.\nSelect the Edit PDF tool in the right pane.\nClick on the text or image you’d like to edit. Acrobat will display all the editing tools you’ll need to format your text.\nNote: If there’s a particular font you want to use, and it’s neither installed nor embedded in your system, you can’t edit any text in your PDF document. For embedded fonts, you can only change the font size and color.\nSave your file once you’re done making the changes.\nYou can use Adobe Acrobat to edit PDF documents in Windows and Mac clients. Plus, if you have an Acrobat Pro DC subscription, you can edit PDFs on Android and iOS from anywhere, on any device using theAcrobat Reader mobile app.\nUsing Microsoft Word If you already own recent versions of Microsoft Word (2013 or later), it’s the easiest and quickest way to edit a document based on an existing PDF.\nThe two formats are different in nature, which means some information like tables with cell spacing, font effects, form-fill-in features and more may get lost in translation.\nFirst, open Microsoft Word program and click File.\nClick Open to select the PDF file you want to edit from the document window.\nYou’ll get a message saying Word will convert your PDF to an editable document, and its contents into a format that Word can display. It won’t change the original PDF though.\nClick OK. Make the changes you want on the document, and click File\u003eSave to save it back to PDF format.\nUsing Google Docs This is a quick and easy to use alternative to editing PDF files. Here are the steps you need to take to edit PDFs in Google Docs.\nLog into Google Drive with your Google account. Click New on the upper left hand side.\nSelect File Upload.\nIn the document window, find the PDF file you want to edit and click Open. Once the upload completes, click Recent on the left pane to find the PDF you just uploaded.\nRight click on the PDF file name and select Open With\u003eGoogle Docs.\nA new, editable Docs file will be created.\nDouble click on it to make the necessary changes and download it as a PDF. You can also email or share it with others using a shareable link.\nUsing a PDF Editor Finding a PDF editor that lets you edit, add or modify text and images, sign your name, fill forms and more isn’t easy. However, there are some online PDF editors you can use with your web browser to edit your PDF file and then save it back to your computer or cloud storage, or share it with others.\nNot all PDF edits offer the same features; some have restrictions on what you can and can’t do, but you can use more than one tool to process the same PDF document. They’re also not as fully featured as desktop PDF editors like Acrobat so they won’t convert perfectly, meaning you’re left with odd formatting styles and incorrect translations.\nOne of the many online PDF editors you can use isSejda PDF editor. A bonus fact is it can run entirely on your web browser, or you can get the desktop version.\nJust go to Sejda PDF’s website, and click PDF Editor under the Edit \u0026 Sign column.\nThere, upload the PDF file you want to edit. You can click on the green Upload PDF file button to upload your file from your computer.\nYou can also select a location by clicking the drop down menu and upload from Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive or a Web Address (URL).\nNote: The desktop edition doesn’t let you add PDFs by URL or online storage services.\nYou now have an editable format of your document. Like Acrobat, Sejda PDF editor offers a menu with editing tools you can use to format your text using different fonts, colors, or sizes.\nMake the changes you want and then click Apply Changes (green button) at the bottom center of your screen.\nDon’t worry about your files getting stored on the internet. Sejda deletes all uploaded files automatically after two hours. You can also delete it yourself by clicking Delete Files icon.\nThese methods are a good start to PDF editing and should be enough to cover the needs of most users.\n","wordCount":"1621","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Milligan"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/4-ways-to-edit-a-pdf-file281364/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How Easy It Is To Edit A Pdf File With These 4 Simple Tricks!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 9, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1621 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michael Milligan</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#trick-1-use-google-docs>Trick 1: Use Google Docs</a></li><li><a href=#trick-2-use-adobe-acrobat-reader-dc>Trick 2: Use Adobe Acrobat Reader DC</a></li><li><a href=#trick-3-use-microsoft-word>Trick 3: Use Microsoft Word</a></li><li><a href=#trick-4-use-an-online-pdf-editor>Trick 4: Use an Online PDF Editor</a></li><li><a href=#in-conclusion>In Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#using-adobe-acrobat>Using Adobe Acrobat</a></li><li><a href=#using-microsoft-word>Using Microsoft Word</a></li><li><a href=#using-google-docs>Using Google Docs</a></li><li><a href=#using-a-pdf-editor>Using a PDF Editor</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><h1 id=you-wont-believe-how-easy-it-is-to-edit-a-pdf-file-with-these-4-simple-tricks>You Won&rsquo;t Believe How Easy It Is To Edit A PDF File With These 4 Simple Tricks!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-wont-believe-how-easy-it-is-to-edit-a-pdf-file-with-these-4-simple-tricks>#</a></h1><p>PDF (Portable Document Format) files have become the standard for sharing and exchanging documents on the web.
