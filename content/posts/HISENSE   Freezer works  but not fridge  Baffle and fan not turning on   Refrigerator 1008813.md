# Shocking Revelation: Hisense Freezer is Working, But Fridge is Failing! Discover the Surprising Culprit Behind the Baffling Problem Now.

Have you ever experienced a scenario where your Hisense freezer is working correctly, but the fridge suddenly isn't? It's an unexpected and bewildering problem that many people face at some point in their lives.

The cold truth is that a failing fridge is frustrating, especially when food inside starts to spoil. However, don't panic just yet; there's still hope. The solution to this problem could be simpler than you think.

Before you go and replace your entire fridge/freezer unit or pay an expensive repair bill, take a closer look at the problem. Most of the time, the cause is due to a clogged defrost drain in the fridge section.

The defrost drain is a tube located at the back of the fridge that allows melted ice to drain out and evaporate. When it's clogged, it prevents water from draining correctly, leading to freezing and overflowing. This can cause the fridge to stop cooling properly, while the freezer continues to function correctly.

So, what can you do to solve this problem?

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you fix the clogged defrost drain and restore your fridge to its former glory:

1. Unplug the fridge/freezer unit from the power source to avoid any electrical hazards.

2. Remove all the items from the fridge and freezer sections to prevent them from spoiling.

3. Locate the defrost drain at the back of the fridge inside the freezer section.

4. Use a turkey baster or a small funnel to pour hot water down the drain, flushing out any debris that may be clogging it. Repeat this process until the water flows freely through the drain.

5. If hot water doesn't unclog the drain, use a thin wire or coat hanger to clear out any blockages manually, but be careful not to damage the drain.

6. After clearing the drain, put back all the items inside the fridge and freezer sections, and plug in the unit back to the power source.

7. Wait for a while and notice if the fridge starts cooling correctly.

In conclusion, a clogged defrost drain in the fridge section is the surprising culprit responsible for a Hisense freezer working, but the fridge failing. By taking a few simple steps, you can fix the problem and avoid costly repairs.

Now that you're equipped with this knowledge, you can tackle this problem head-on and solve it without breaking the bank.


## Chosen Solution
 I have a Hisense HR6FDFF630S fridge/freezer. 6 years old.
Fridge suddenly stopped working, however freezer works fine.
Have checked:
Coils not frozen over.
Baffle closed and fan not running. When I open the baffle while fridge is off, then connect fridge, the baffle closes.
I’m guessing its the thermostat or temperature control board.
How can I work it out/fix?
Thanks!

 Hi @christolds ,
I don’t know your fridge but was wondering if the door switch is faulty .
I’m not sure if this is the correct part. I take it to mean that it is a reed magnet switch. It is shown as  part #107 - p.11 on the parts diagram. I may be wrong about this but couldn’t find any mention of a door switch in the parts list
The evaporator fan will stop when the door is opened so as to prevent any cold air being blown out of the refrigerator compartment.
If it is the door switch (or you know where it is located and it is a magnetic reed switch) if you hold a magnet next to it the fridge light should go out if the door is open and the evap fan should start up. If they don’t then the switch is faulty.
The other way to test the switch if you haven’t got a magnet or don’t know the location of the switch, if it is not what I thought it was, is to set up your mobile phone to record video and stick it in the fridge, pointing it at the fridge light and then close the door. If it shows that the light stays on when the door is closed the switch is faulty and the evaporator fan will not run.
The freezer will stay cold because that’s where the evaporator unit is located.

 Here are the nine causes for this behavior, hopefully you can narrow it down:
