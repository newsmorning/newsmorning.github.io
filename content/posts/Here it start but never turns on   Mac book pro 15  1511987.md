Are you a Mac Book Pro user who has encountered the issue of starting but never turning on? If yes, then you are not alone. The Mac Book Pro starting but never turning on the issue is a common problem that users face. There are several reasons why this issue occurs, but the most common reason is a faulty power supply.

The power supply of a MacBook Pro is responsible for converting electrical energy from an outlet into the energy that powers the computer. A faulty power supply can prevent the computer from receiving enough power to turn on. If this is the case, the computer will start but never turn on.

Another reason why the MacBook Pro starts but never turns on is a faulty battery. If the battery of the computer is faulty, it will not receive enough power to turn on. In this case, plugging in the power supply might not work.

One way to check if the problem is with the power supply or the battery is to remove the battery and only use the power supply to turn the computer on. If the computer turns on without the battery, then the battery is the problem. If the computer still does not turn on, then the power supply is the issue.

If the battery is the problem, you may need to replace it. Contact the Apple Support team or seek the help of an Apple authorized service provider to replace the defective battery.

If the power supply is the issue, you may need to replace it as well. Here are some steps to replace the power supply:

1. Turn off the computer and unplug the power supply.

2. Locate the battery and remove it.

3. Find the power supply in the computer.

4. Disconnect the power supply from the computer.

5. Replace the power supply with a new one.

6. Reconnect the new power supply to the computer.

7. Reinsert the battery.

8. Turn on the computer.

In conclusion, the Mac Book Pro starting but never turning on issue is a common problem that users face. The problem can be caused by a faulty power supply or a faulty battery. By following the steps listed above, you can diagnose and fix the problem yourself. If you are unsure about how to fix the problem or do not feel comfortable doing it yourself, seek the services of an Apple authorized service provider.

## Chosen Solution
 I can here the chime start and the fan turns on but screen does not turn on

 Check the ram by opening it and making sure they are seated correctly. Next, turn it on and shine a flashlight on the display. If you can see something on it, then the backlight is bad. If you can't see anything, then check the connector for the display. Or the display could be bad.
