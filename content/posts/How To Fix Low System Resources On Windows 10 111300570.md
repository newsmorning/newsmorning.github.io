STOP struggling with sluggish Windows 10/11! Here's the ULTIMATE solution to boost your PC's system resources!

Are you tired of waiting for your Windows 10/11 PC to start up or run programs sluggishly? Do you feel like you're wasting precious time waiting for sluggish programs to launch or work? If you're nodding your head in agreement, then it's time to take action and give your PC's system resources a boost!

A slow computer can be frustrating, especially when you have important work to do. However, the good news is that with a few simple tweaks, you can optimize your PC and ensure it's running at its peak performance. Here is the ultimate solution to help you boost your PC's system resources:

1. Uninstall Unnecessary Programs

Over time, you may have installed several programs on your PC that you no longer use. These programs can eat up valuable disk space, slow down system performance, and cause other issues. To improve performance, navigate to the Control Panel and uninstall all unnecessary programs.

2. Disable Startup Programs

When you install a new program, it often includes an option to start automatically with your PC. Too many startup programs can slow down your computer's boot times and hog system resources. You can disable startup programs by opening the Task Manager (press Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and clicking on the Startup tab. From here, disable the programs you don't need at startup.

3. Upgrading RAM

RAM is an essential component of your computer that stores frequently accessed data. If your computer lacks adequate RAM, everything will slow down. To optimize your PC's performance, consider upgrading your RAM. It's a quick and simple way to get your PC running smoothly.

4. Optimize Your Disk Space

Windows 10/11 comes with a built-in disk cleanup utility that can remove temporary files, old downloads, and other system files that you don't need. To optimize your disk space, open the Disk Cleanup utility and select the items you want to clean up. This will free up valuable disk space and improve overall system performance.

5. Update Your Software

Outdated software can cause compatibility problems, which can put a strain on system resources. Therefore, it’s important to regularly update your software, particularly your system and security software. This will help prevent compatibility issues and ensure that your system runs smoothly.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a sluggish Windows 10/11 computer can drive you crazy, but with the right tweaks, you can improve performance easily. In essence, uninstalling unnecessary programs, disabling unnecessary startup programs, increasing your RAM, optimizing your disk space, and updating your software are just some of the simple ways to boost your PC's system resources. Try them out, and you'll be amazed at how speedily your PC performs!

## Fix: Low System Resources On Windows 11
 
### 1. Close All Programs
 
Programs running on your computer use your system’s resources. So, it goes without saying that if your Windows 10 or 11 is low on the system’s resources, you should close all the apps except for the one in use. Especially if your end goal is to log into another user account or if you are facing Zoom audio stuttering, you should first check that all the other programs are closed.

System Cleaner
 
Plus, there are tons of other features in Advanced System Optimizer that can help you safeguard your system resources and thereby help apps and system per se function properly. 
 
### 2. Disable Background Processes
 
Apps running in the background hog on your system’s resources. So, suppose you are encountering issues in logging in as another user, facing audio issues in an application like Zoom, or facing other glitches while using an app that plays video content. In that case, you can opt for a clean boot on your computer and disable irrelevant background processes –
 
1. Press Windows + R to open Run . When the dialog box opens, type msconfig and hit the Enter key. 
 
2. Uncheck the Load startup services under the Selective Startup radio button. 
 
3. From the tabs on the top, click on Services. 
 
4. Click on the checkbox that says Hide all Microsoft Services
 
5. Click on Disable all. 
 
6. Go to the tab that says Startup and click on the button titled Open Task Manager. 
 
7. Select the apps you want to disable on the Start and click Disable. 
 
Now, try logging in as a different user or check if the program which was earlier not functioning properly is functioning correctly or not.  
 
### 3. Update Display Drivers
 
Applications like Zoom significantly impact graphics card drivers. Here you must have the latest or updated graphics drivers because outdated drivers can cause “Low system resources” on Windows 11/10. If you are new to updating drivers on Windows, we have covered an in-depth post on how you can update drivers in Windows. So, go ahead, update drivers and check if you have been able to resolve the issue at hand.
 
### 4. Perform SFC and DISM Scans
 
Corrupt system files can impair the functionality of apps on your computer. Moreover, if the system files related to your chosen user account are corrupt, you won’t be able to log in. Therefore, a simple SFC and DISM scan using the Command Prompt may help you fix the issue.
 
To perform both scans, here are the steps mentioned below – 
 
1. Type cmd in the Windows search bar and click on Run as administrator from the right-hand side. 
 
2. When the Command Prompt opens, first type sfc /scannow and hit the Enter. What this would do is it will replace corrupted system files with healthy ones. Once the scan is over, check if you are still getting the error.
 
3. Even if the SFC command doesn’t help resolve the issue, open another administrative Command Prompt using the above steps and type –
 
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
 
4. Restart your computer and check if you have been able to resolve the issue. 
 
### 5. Mute Other Participants’ Audio
 
Since the issue at hand is faced by people conducting Zoom meetings, one option is to mute the audio. That means you can mute other participants because if many participants are using the audio simultaneously, it may also affect your system’s resources. 
 
### Wrapping Up
 
Hope that these solutions have worked for you and that you have been able to fix the “Low system resources on Windows 11/10” while using apps like Zoom or trying to create another user account. For more such useful troubleshooting content, keep reading WeTheGeek.
