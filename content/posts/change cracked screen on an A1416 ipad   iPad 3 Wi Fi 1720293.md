## Chosen Solution
 What should I order to do this.

 just go to iPad 3 Screen Digitizer Assembly]
or you can look for cheaper parts in e-bay or amazon but again they definitely would be cheap in quality too.

I only use GroupVertical parts for iPad/iPhone repair.  With the volume of Chinese knock off screens out there, I try to stay with companies I know stand by their products.  I'm sure the iFixit one listed above works well, I'm just not sure its worth paying double what you can get a good screen for.
