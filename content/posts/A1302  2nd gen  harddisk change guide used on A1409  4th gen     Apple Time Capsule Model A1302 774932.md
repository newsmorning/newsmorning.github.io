You won't believe how swapping a hard drive can transform your Apple Time Capsule A1409 into a powerhouse with this 2nd gen guide!

Are you tired of slow internet speeds and limited storage space? If so, it may be time for an upgrade to your Apple Time Capsule A1409. However, before you shell out money for a brand new device, consider a simple and affordable solution: swapping out the hard drive.

The Apple Time Capsule A1409 has an internal 2.5-inch hard drive that can be easily removed and replaced with a larger and faster one. This upgrade can take your old and sluggish Time Capsule and transform it into a powerhouse with lightning-fast speeds and ample storage space.

Before beginning the upgrade process, be sure to purchase a compatible hard drive. Most 2.5-inch SATA hard drives will work, but it's best to double-check that the drive is compatible with your specific model of Time Capsule. You can find this information online or by consulting with an Apple specialist.

Once you have your new hard drive, it's time to begin the upgrade process. Follow these simple steps to swap out the old drive for the new one:

1. Unplug your Time Capsule and let it cool down for a few minutes.

2. Turn the device over and remove the four rubber feet to reveal four screws.

3. Remove the screws and lift off the top cover of the Time Capsule.

4. Locate the hard drive and disconnect it from the motherboard and any other cables.

5. Remove the hard drive from the Time Capsule's frame and replace it with the new one.

6. Reconnect the new hard drive to the motherboard and any other cables.

7. Reattach the Time Capsule's cover and screws.

8. Plug in your Time Capsule and allow it to power up.

9. Format the new hard drive and set up your Time Capsule as desired.

Congratulations! You have successfully upgraded your Apple Time Capsule A1409 with a new hard drive.

Not only will your Time Capsule now have faster speeds and more storage space, but it will also have extended life as well. Swapping out the old hard drive is a simple and cost-effective way to enjoy improved performance and capability from your trusted Time Capsule.

In conclusion, if you have an Apple Time Capsule A1409 that's slowing down or running out of space, don't rush out to buy a brand new one. Instead, consider swapping out the hard drive for an affordable and simple upgrade. With this 2nd gen guide, you won't believe the transformation your Time Capsule will make with a new hard drive.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a 2TB A1409 Airport Time Capsule. The drive is full and backup didn't work since I got Sierra (middle March 2017). I am wondering if it needs a reset, maybe even a format, and I think it's a good time to upgrade the drive. Both Time Capsule and Mac has the latest updates available (I think it is 7.6.7 for the Time Capsule)
Can I use the 2nd gen (A1302) HDD change guide for my 4th gen (A1409) time machine?
Can I use a 10TB drive as suggested elsewhere (i.e. Seagate ST10000DM0004), or would the power draw, temperature or other issues make this a bad option?
If I don't care about the rubber mat, wouldn't the unit be better cooled off without it? I plug a USB powered fan into the unit anyway, to keep it cool (maybe I should use a standalone USB rather than the built in?)
Thank you for answering.
Update (04/08/2017)
Bonus question: When I remove the internal drive, can I retrieve the backups from it without using a Time Capsule (like a power/USB connection that suits this drive type)?

 One option would be to erase your Time Capsule using AirPort Utility in your Applications > Utilities folder. You'd of course lose your backup history if you did this, but if there are no problems with the device you could simply create a new backup.
The A1302 and A1409 Time Capsules both have very similar designs, so the guides are largely interchangeable. I've swapped hard drives in several model Time Capsules without issue, but I've never attempted it with a drive larger than 3TB. It is possible that larger drives wouldn't be recognized properly, but it wouldn't hurt to try.
The USB port on the Time Capsule is designed for use with a shared printer, but I can't see any reason using it for an external fan would be an issue.
Once you've removed the drive from the Time Capsule, you can still access the data by putting it into an external enclosure, though the backups are stored in password-protected disk image files that you'll need to mount.
