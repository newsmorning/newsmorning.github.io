# You Won't Believe This Simple Hack to Revive Your Old MacBook Air and Save BIG on 12 16 Pin SSD!

If you're the proud owner of an old MacBook Air, you know that its small size, light weight, and long battery life make it an ideal travel companion. But as your MacBook Air ages, it may start to run slower and become less responsive. If you're facing these issues, one possible solution might be to replace your machine's solid-state drive (SSD). However, buying a new SSD can be expensive, and it might not guarantee an improvement in performance. In this article, we'll show you a simple hack to revive your old MacBook Air and save money in the process.

## The Problem with Older MacBook Airs

The first MacBook Air was released in January 2008 and featured a 1.6 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, an 80 GB hard drive, and a price tag of $1,799. The device was praised for its slim form factor and long battery life, but it also had its drawbacks, including a slow processor and a limited amount of storage.

Over the years, Apple has made improvements to the MacBook Air, including faster processors and larger storage options. However, if you have an older MacBook Air, you may be stuck with a slow machine that can't keep up with your needs.

One of the main culprits behind the slow performance of older MacBook Airs is the solid-state drive. The first-generation MacBook Airs used an 80 GB or 64 GB SSD with a 1.8-inch form factor and a 6 Gbps interface. As technology improved, Apple started using a 12+16 pin form factor for the SSD in its MacBook Air models. However, this made upgrading the SSD a challenge, as there weren't many aftermarket options available.

## The Solution: Adapter Cards

If you're looking to upgrade the SSD in your older MacBook Air, you may have heard about adapter cards. These small devices allow you to use a newer, faster SSD with your older MacBook Air without having to replace the entire motherboard.

There are two types of adapter cards available: 12+16 pin TOSHIBA adapter and 12+16 pin SAMSUNG adapter. These cards allow you to use a newer SSD with your older MacBook Air, which can improve performance and increase storage capacity.

The best part about using an adapter card is that you can save money. Instead of buying a new SSD from Apple, which can cost hundreds of dollars, you can buy a newer SSD and an adapter card for much less. Plus, you can choose the brand and capacity of the SSD that's best for your needs.

## How to Install an Adapter Card

Installing an adapter card is simple and doesn't require any special skills or tools. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Purchase an adapter card that's compatible with your MacBook Air's model number.

2. Turn off your MacBook Air and disconnect the power cable.

3. Remove the bottom case of your MacBook Air.

4. Locate the SSD and remove it from the logic board.

5. Insert the SSD into the adapter card.

6. Insert the adapter card into the logic board.

7. Replace the bottom case of your MacBook Air.

8. Connect the power cable and turn on your MacBook Air.

That's it! Once you've installed the adapter card, you should notice a significant improvement in performance.

## Conclusion

Using an adapter card to upgrade the SSD in your old MacBook Air is a simple and cost-effective solution. Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on a new SSD or a new machine altogether, you can give your MacBook Air a new lease on life. Plus, by choosing a newer SSD, you'll benefit from faster speeds and more storage capacity. So why not give it a try? Your wallet (and your MacBook Air) will thank you.

## Chosen Solution
 So my friends macbook air a1466 is completely dead but he really wants to try and save all his photos. The mac has a 12+16 pin ssd from sandisk. I can’t seem to be able to find an adapter (preferbly in europe) which will allow me to save it. Either a M2 adapter so I can hook it up to my pc or a usb adapter.

 Well to start off with Apple did their own thing! The SSD’s Apple used are custom to their needs and are not M.2 compliant!
Here’s a good guide to review The Ultimate Guide to Apple’s Proprietary SSDs You’ll see your friends system is using a Generation 3 SSD which uses a PCIe 2.0 2 lanes using AHCI.
So you’ll need this OWC Envoy Pro Portable, Bus-Powered USB 3.0 Storage Enclosure to hold the SSD. In addition you’ll need to connect it to a Mac system to gain access to the files.

 I need to recover data from a SSD 12+16 pin from my Macbook Pro A1502 but I have a Windows PC. How can I do it? Will the OWC ENVOY PRO gonna work using Transmac as well?
PLEASE HELP!
