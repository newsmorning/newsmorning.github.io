Title: Are You Losing Money Without Knowing? Learn about Depreciation Recapture that Could Affect Your Taxes!

Introduction:
When purchasing property for business or rental purposes, many individuals tend to take advantage of depreciation deductions. Depreciation is a tax deduction that enables you to subtract the cost of the property over a period of its useful life. Although depreciation may appear to be a good way to reduce your taxable income, it could also lead to depreciation recapture— a tax you must pay when selling or disposing of depreciated property. Depreciation recapture can catch you off guard, resulting in an unexpected tax bill. Thus, it’s crucial to understand its effects and how to avoid losing money without knowing.

What Is Depreciation Recapture?
Depreciation recapture is the taxation of the depreciation income that was deducted while you owned the property. When you sell or dispose of a depreciated asset, a portion of the gain or profit is allocated to the total amount claimed as depreciation. This amount is then taxed as a capital gain or ordinary income depending on the type of property and how it was used.

Recapturing Depreciation on Real Property:
For commercial and residential rental properties, depreciation recapture is taxed at a maximum rate of 25% of your total gain. The percentage is lower if the property was previously used for personal residence or has been held for an extended period. For instance, if you owned a rental property for five years and claimed depreciation deductions during that time, the government would tax you on the amount of depreciation claimed at a maximum tax rate of 25%. 

Recapturing Depreciation on Other Assets:
For other business assets, depreciation recapture is taxed at a maximum rate of 39.6%, depending on the amount of the depreciation taken, and how the asset is classified. The percentage is lower for assets that were held for an extended period and classified as nonresidential real property. 

How to Avoid Depreciation Recapture:
One of the ways to avoid depreciation recapture is to avoid taking too many depreciation deductions. Consultation with a tax professional or a CPA can help you estimate which depreciation deductions are beneficial for you and which ones aren’t. Another way to avoid depreciation recapture is to do a 1031 exchange. A 1031 exchange allows you to defer paying taxes on the capital gains by exchanging your property for a like-kind property. In other words, you can swap one investment property for another, and tax deferment is possible until you decide to sell.

Conclusion:
Depreciation recapture can be a complicated tax process that can catch up to you when selling or disposing of depreciated property. The key to avoiding depreciation recapture is to be cautious with depreciation deductions and consult with a tax professional or CPA. Also, a 1031 exchange can be an effective way to defer the depreciation recapture tax, and it’s crucial to know which assets qualify for tax deferment. Knowing about depreciation recapture and how to avoid it can help you save money and prevent surprise tax bills.

## What is Depreciation Recapture
 
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 1245 and 1250 contain various rules associated with the recaptured depreciation and the types of property subject to it. The provision is common with real estate rental properties and occurs when the property is sold. In addition, taxpayers can use investing tools like the 1031 tax-deferred exchange to minimize the tax burden due to recapture.

Key Takeaways

 
- Depreciation Recapture refers to the portion of the gain realized from the sale of depreciable property and taxed as ordinary income.Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 1245 and 1250 contain various rules associated with this recapture procedure. In 2022, the recapture tax rate is capped at 25%.Its calculation involves identifying the adjusted cost basis of the asset sold, depreciation deductions or accumulated depreciation, and realized gain. If accumulated depreciation and realized gain are compared, the smaller of the two is taken as the recapture amount. Taxpayers use the depreciation deduction provision to reduce the tax owed, and the recapture provision helps the government offset losses due to the deduction provision.

 
### Depreciation Recapture Explained
 
Depreciation recapture is associated with the depreciable property, and selling the depreciable property results in the ordinary income and reduces the capital gain reported for tax purposes. This recapture income under IRC section 1245 or 1250 is also an example of hot assets. The taxpayer is liable to pay tax at the ordinary income tax rate for a specific or whole portion of the capital gain obtained by selling a depreciated capital asset.
 
It is applied when there is a gain, and there will be no recapture when there is a loss. The maximum value of the recapture tax rate is 25%. Applying the ordinary tax income rate, which is generally greater than the capital gain tax rate, helps the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) compensate for the reduced taxes they receive due to the depreciation deduction allowed. Hence helping the government to offset losses. Furthermore, It is usually applied to the asset held for more than one year, incurring operating or maintenance expenses changing its cost basis.
 
### How to Calculate Depreciation Recapture?
 
The calculation involves the following steps:
 
Step 1: Calculate adjusted cost basis
 
Adjusted cost basis = Purchase price + Improvements – (Accumulated depreciation or depreciation deductions)
 
Step 2: Calculate gain from the sale
 
Realized gain = Selling price – Adjusted cost basis
 
Step 3: Compare realized gain and the accumulated depreciation (depreciation deductions)
 
If the realized gain < accumulated depreciation
 
Depreciation recapture = Realized gain 
 
The realized gain is taxed as ordinary income
 
Tax = Realized gain * Depreciation recapture tax rate
 
If the realized gain > accumulated depreciation
 
Depreciation recapture = Accumulated depreciation 
 
The accumulated depreciation is taxed as ordinary income, and the remaining amount in the realized gain is taxed as a capital gain.
 
### Example
 
Let’s look into the following example to understand the calculation better:
 
Given the purchase price, accumulated depreciation, and selling price.
 
#### Case 1:
 
The purchase price of an asset: $7,000
 
Accumulated depreciation or depreciation deductions (3 years): $4,200 (1400*3)
 
Sales price: $5,000
 
Step 1: Calculate adjusted cost basis
 
=$7,000 + 0 – $4200
 
=$2,800
 
Step 2: Calculate gain from the sale
 
= $5000 – $2,800
 
=$2,200
 
Step 3: Compare realized gain and accumulated depreciation
 
Here the realized gain is less than the accumulated depreciation ($2,200 < $4,200)
 
Hence, recapture is $2,200
 
This amount obtained from the realized gain is treated as ordinary income instead of capital gain.
 
#### Case 2:
 
If, in the above case, the selling price is $8,000, steps 2 and 3 will give different answers:
 
Step 2: Realized gain = Selling price – Adjusted cost basis
 
= $8,000 – $2,800
 
=$5,200
 
Here the realized gain is greater than the accumulated depreciation ($5,200 > $4,200)
 
Hence, recapture is $4,200, taxed as ordinary income, and the remaining $1,000 is taxed as a capital gain.

This article has been a Guide to What is Depreciation Recapture. We explain depreciation recapture tax calculation, the tax rate in 2021/2022 on the rental property. You can learn more from the following articles –
 
Rental property is subjected to depreciation, and the rental property owner can use the depreciation expense to reduce the taxable income. The recapture procedure applies when the rental property is sold for an amount greater than its adjusted cost basis. IRS uses this procedure to collect taxes on the gain the owner made by selling depreciated rental property hence recovering the benefits the owner received by applying depreciation deductions.
 
In 2021, the tax rate applied on the recaptured amount was 25%. For 2022 the tax rate is limited to 25%.
 
Investors can avoid applying ordinary income tax rates on a whole or specific portion of the realized gain obtained by selling depreciable property. One of the methods is to perform a 1031 tax-deferred exchange involving an exchange made with a like-kind property differing capital gains tax and delaying the recapture.
