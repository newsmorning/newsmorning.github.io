Mafia Definitive Edition doesn’t support HDR on PC Many players were reported that they were disappointed to see that Mafia: Definitive Edition lacked a High-Dynamic Range option despite it being a feature heavily marketed in the promotional material.\nAdditionally, they were disappointed to learn that their console counterparts didn’t have this issue.\nUnfortunately, there is no current solution to this problem available.

Issues with pre-loading Mafia: Definitive Edition This particular bug targets Xbox One users, and it is mostly an inconvenience.\nMany users reported that they are having difficulties pre-loading Mafia: Definitive Edition, especially if they have some of the previous titles in their gaming libraries.\nThis is not necessarily a bug related to the game itself, but rather the way your console’s game store handles game purchases.\nFor example, a lot of times right after you buy a game it starts auto-downloading, but this may not always be the case.\nIf you purchased Mafia: Definitive Edition and it didn’t pre-load, go to your Ready to install list and check if it’s there.\n7. Mafia Trilogy PS4 owners find Mafia: D.E. at the end of the results A PlayStation 4-exclusive bug and it is more of an inconvenience than a game breaker, users reported that if you already own the trilogy in your gaming library, searching for Mafia: Definitive Edition will make it appear at the end of your searches.\nThis is a bug since usually any game you would be looking for would be among the first results, especially if you already own entries from that franchise or series\nAdditionally, those that own Mafia 1 reported that Mafia: Definitive Edition is labeled as unavailable for purchase.\nAccording to users, there is a workaround that they can try:\nThat pretty much wraps up our list of common bugs and issues found in Mafia: Definitive Edition.
