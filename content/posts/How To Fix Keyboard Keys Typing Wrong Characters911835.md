# Stop Struggling with Wrong Keyboard Characters: Easy Fix for Keyboard Keys Typing the Wrong Characters!

Are you tired of dealing with a keyboard that constantly types the wrong characters? Maybe you’re trying to type out an important report or send an email to a co-worker, only to find that the characters you’re typing are nothing like what you intended. It can be frustrating and time-consuming, but fear not - there are simple solutions to this problem.

Here are some ways to fix keyboard keys typing the wrong characters:

## Check Your Language Settings

Sometimes, your keyboard may be set to a language other than the one you normally use. This can happen by accident, and you may not realize that your keyboard is set to a different language until you start typing. Fortunately, it’s easy to change your keyboard’s language settings. On a Mac, go to “System Preferences” and click on “Keyboard.” You can then choose the language you want to use from the drop-down menu. On Windows, go to “Settings,” then “Time & Language,” then “Language,” and select the language you want to use.

## Clean Your Keyboard

Another reason your keyboard may be typing the wrong characters is because it’s dirty. If your keyboard has been used heavily, it’s common for debris, dust or hair to get into the keyboard and cause keys to stick or not work as intended. To clean your keyboard, shut down your computer and unplug the keyboard. Turn it upside down and gently shake it to get rid of any loose debris. Use a can of compressed air to blow out any remaining debris between the keys, make sure to give it some distance so you don’t damage the keyboard.

## Use A Keyboard Tester

You can use a keyboard tester to determine if there is a problem with your keyboard or if it’s simply USER ERROR. A keyboard tester is a software tool that enables you to test every key on your keyboard to check if they are functioning properly. These tools are widely available online and most of them are free to use. Some of the popular options include the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator, PassMark Keyboard Test, and the Keyboard Checker.

## Replace The Keyboard

If all else fails, it might be time to replace your keyboard. Over time, the keys can wear out, become stuck, or simply stop working altogether. This can be a frustrating problem to deal with, but replacing your keyboard is an easy fix that can save you a lot of headaches in the long run. Fortunately, keyboards are relatively inexpensive and easy to replace.

In conclusion, dealing with a keyboard that types the wrong characters can be a frustrating problem to deal with. However, by checking your language settings, cleaning the keyboard, using a keyboard tester, or replacing the keyboard altogether you can get your keyboard working properly again. Don’t let a malfunctioning keyboard stop you from getting your work done - try out these simple solutions the next time you run into this problem.
