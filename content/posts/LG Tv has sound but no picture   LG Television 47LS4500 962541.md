Title: You Won't Believe What's Happening to this LG TV! Sound but NO picture? Find out What's Causing the Mystery!

Introduction

Picture this: you're comfortably sitting on your couch, ready to binge-watch your favorite show, but suddenly your LG TV disappoints you - there's no picture, only sound! No one wants to experience that feeling. How can you fix it? What could be causing the issue? In this article, we'll explore the possible reasons behind this mystery and provide some tips to help you get your LG TV picture back.

The Cause of LG TVs with Sound but No Picture

The reason behind the sound but no picture issue could be either hardware or software related. Here are some possible causes:

1. Loose Connections

Check to ensure all cables and connectors are properly plugged in. Sometimes they can become loose, especially if the TV was recently moved or accidentally knocked. Check the power cord and plug it directly into the wall socket, avoiding power extension cords.

2. Damaged Cables

If the cables are damaged, it can cause no picture or poor quality image. Check for any damages, kinks, or bends. If you notice any, replace them with high-quality cables.

3. TV Settings

Your TV settings could be the cause of the no picture issue. It's possible they were accidentally changed or are incorrectly configured. Resetting the TV to its default settings or adjusting the TV settings (brightness or contrast) can help.

4. Hardware Damage

Extensive or continuous use of an LG TV can cause wear and tear on sensitive electronic components inside the TV. Over time, that can lead to hardware damage, affecting the picture output.

5. Software Errors

Another cause of no picture issues is software errors. If your LG TV has outdated software, it can interfere with its performance. Ensure your TV is up-to-date with the latest software updates.

3. Check the Settings

Reset your LG TV to its default settings or adjust the settings, such as brightness or contrast. Check also the TV's settings to ensure they are correctly configured.

4. Hardware Diagnostics

## Chosen Solution
 My LG 47LS4500 TV is automatically turning off after 5-10sec but the sound stays on until I turn the tv off. Is there anyway to fix this? I’ve unplugged and plugged everything back in and I’ve put new batteries in all of the controllers even the ones I don’t use can anybody tell me what else I can do because I’m about to throw this in the garbage please let me know what else I can do soon because I really don’t want to throw this away thank you.

 Next step in diagnostics is to see if you have picture at all, by using a flashlight and shining it through after display goes dark. Also does backlight come back on momentarily as you turn tv back on?
