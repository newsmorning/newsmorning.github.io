## Chosen Solution
 I would love to replace the cracked screen on my Nook HD plus (BNTV600), but I can't source a replacement screen/digitizer. Does anyone know of a reliable source for this repair part?

 Keep searching. Nook HD+ parts r very hard to find. Ebay has good working Nooks $50-60. U may have to find a used nook & do the repair that way.
