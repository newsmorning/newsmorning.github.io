Unlock the Secret Naming Scheme of the Mysterious Dualshock 4 Component!

Gaming enthusiasts have been awed by Sony's stunning Dualshock 4 controllers since their debut in 2013. However, something that many gamers might not know is there are tiny components hidden beneath the surface of these controllers, which serves a significant purpose for smooth and seamless gameplay. But what exactly are these components, and why are they essential? Moreover, what are their naming schemes?

The Dualshock 4 contains a small, ingenious component, known as K4B4G1646D-BCK0 - this component serves as the console's memory, allowing gamers to seamlessly store and load games through fast, efficient RAM. The K4B4G1646D-BCK0 is a Samsung-made DRAM that comes in the 4 GB package. The component supports lower voltage consumption, resulting from a drop in the memory's operating voltage from 1.5 volts to 1.2 volts. The DRAM can attain up to 2.4GB/s worth of bandwidth.

But where does the naming of the K4B4G1646D-BCK0 come from? To clarify, Samsung's naming scheme is front-loaded, meaning the beginning of the names signify particular characteristics of the components' purpose. So, let's unpack the K4B4G1646D-BCK0's naming scheme. "K4" stands for "DRAM," while "B4" means "4 Gbit." "G16" refers to Samsung's 16 Gb mainstream DRAM, which is built using their smaller and more efficient 20-nanometer process. "46" refers to the DRAM component's capacity per die, which is 4GB. The initials "D-B" stand for "Die revision," known as “B” revision. Lastly, the "CK0" portion of the DRAM's code stands for memory compatibility features.

In conclusion, the intricate inner workings and components of the Dualshock 4 controllers are fascinating and impressive, particularly the naming scheme for the DRAM component responsible for handling memory storage and transfer. The next time you pick up your Dualshock 4 and jump into a thrilling game, remember the significance of the tiny component working tirelessly to provide seamless gaming performance.
