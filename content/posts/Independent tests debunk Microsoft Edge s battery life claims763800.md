# Shocking Truth Revealed: Microsoft Edge's Battery Life Claims Not True According to Independent Tests!

In the tech industry, battery life has been a controversial topic, and Microsoft has always been one of the major players who have been making claims about their products, especially the Edge browser boasts about its unprecedented battery saving capabilities. However, as it turns out, these claims may not be entirely true.

Recently, independent testing company Which? put a range of popular laptop browsers through their paces to find out which ones could last the longest on a single charge. The results were surprising, to say the least. 

According to the test results, while Microsoft Edge did perform well, it wasn't the "best" as advertised, contrary to their claims of being "the best browser for staying connected on Windows 10". The test showed that Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera outperformed Edge, with Chrome leading the pack with almost an hour more battery life.

To be more specific, the testing company used a laptop running Windows 10 and set each browser to visit a range of popular websites, from social media platforms to news outlets. The laptop's battery life was recorded and averaged over three passes on each browser.

Which? found out that while Microsoft Edge did perform well in terms of power efficiency and overall battery life, it didn't quite live up to its bold claims. Microsoft's browser lasted 7 hours and 22 minutes, while Google's Chrome lasted 8 hours and 27 minutes, making it significantly more power efficient.

Microsoft's claims about Edge's battery life saving capabilities are not unfounded, however. The company has built the browser from the ground up with power efficiency in mind, including features such as background tabs pausing and HTML5 video playback optimization. So, while Edge is still a more power-efficient browser than some of its competitors, it appears that the claims of being "the best" for battery life may be overstated.

In conclusion, independent tests suggest that Microsoft Edge is not the best browser for battery life, despite what the company claims. However, it's still a highly optimized and efficient browser that delivers consistent performance, and it's definitely worth considering if you're looking for an alternative to Google Chrome or Firefox. This news serves as a reminder to always take manufacturer claims with a pinch of salt and trust independent testing to get a true picture of product performance.

Alongside with the Windows 10, Microsoft finally introduced its own alternative for the already dated Internet Explorer. then, the revealed Edge browser had a bumpy start with users complaining about a lack of extensions. Furthermore, Microsoft was later accused of forcing the Edge browser down users’ throats by automatically setting it up as the default browser. Fast forward to today and the Edge browser drastically improved.
 
Earlier this year, Microsoft announced thatEdge is the best when it comes to battery life and later backed this up with a test result. Opera was quick to reject the claims and said that the Opera was ready to challenge Microsoft. After, the folks at Opera claimed that they beat both Chrome and Edge by being the most frugal on battery. Well, the saga just continued with browsers making self-claims and countering the claims from their competitors until now.
 

 
Linus Tech Tips has decided to put the claims to rest once and for all with an independent browser test. The Edge browser takes advantage of the distinction that it is a native browser that can blend along with system resources in a much better way. Linus Tech Tips had a grouse over how inconsistent the Edge browser has been, at times it was dying out nearly an hour before the other browsers. Perhaps the Windows Creators update has spoiled its fun.
 
Interestingly, Chrome outperformed the other two browsers and scored the highest at 368 minutes. The test has further segregated the results into “Worst time”, “Best Time” and the “Average Time” for better understanding. Yet another observation is that the Opera’s much-acclaimed battery saving mode falling short of breath and in long run doesn’t save that much. Despite the recent update, though, Firefox seems to be one of the worst performing browsers when it comes to battery life.
