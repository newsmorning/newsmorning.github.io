# Take Control of Your TV with the Logitech Harmony Companion - The Ultimate Entertainment Command Center!

Are you tired of juggling between multiple remote controls to operate your TV, cable box, and other streaming devices? Say goodbye to the hassle and confusion of managing your home entertainment system by using the Logitech Harmony Companion, the ultimate entertainment command center that puts you in charge of your viewing experience.

With the Harmony Companion, you can control all your home theater equipment with a single remote, eliminating the need to keep track of numerous remotes and fumbling to find the right one for the job. The device can manage up to eight different devices, including your TV, cable or satellite box, DVD player, gaming console, sound system, and streaming media player.

The Harmony Companion is incredibly user-friendly and easy to set up. The device connects to your Wi-Fi network and allows you to use your smartphone as a remote control, as well as an app that you can customize to suit your specific viewing preferences. The app lets you create custom activities, helping you switch to different inputs, turn on certain devices, and activate specific settings with the press of a button.

If you have a smart home, the Harmony Companion can integrate with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and other similar devices, enabling you to use voice commands to control your TV and other electronics. The integration with smart home devices also allows you to set up "scenes," which are predefined settings that adjust your smart home devices, depending on your preferences. For instance, you can create a "Movie Time" scene that dims the lights, starts your favorite streaming service, and sets the sound system to surround sound.

Another great feature of the Harmony Companion is its ability to learn commands. If you have a remote control that is not on the Harmony database, you can use it instead to teach the device how to control your other devices, ensuring that you never have to use that remote again.

In conclusion, the Logitech Harmony Companion is the perfect solution for anyone who wants to declutter their TV-watching experience and take control of their home entertainment system. It is affordable, easy to use, and customizable to suit your preferences, making it the ultimate entertainment command center for your home. So, if you are tired of the confusion of multiple remote controls, grab a Harmony Companion today and sit back, relax, and enjoy your favorite shows and movies with ease.

We purchased the Logitech Harmony Companion so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.

 

If you’re ready to take the next step toward a more integrated smart home or home entertainment setup, you may want to consider a capable universal remote like the Logitech Harmony Companion. The Logitech brand is no stranger to universal smart remotes, but the Harmony Companion brings the best of what the Harmony app, Harmony Hub, and simple remote have to offer at a reasonable price.

 

We spent some time with the Logitech Harmony Companion to see just how easy it is to set up and use with Alexa and navigate the app. 

 
##   Design: A little out of the ordinary  
 

While it lacks a touchscreen or flashy design elements, the Harmony Companion is still pretty sleek. First, there’s the remote itself, which is lightweight at 4.2 ounces and quite slim at just .81 inches deep and 2.13 inches wide. It measures 7.25 inches in length, and has a nice ergonomic arch, which makes it easy to cradle in your hand. The buttons are responsive and don’t require a lot of fussing over, although the short- versus long-push actions are sometimes difficult to discern.

 

There’s also the Harmony Hub, a black and glossy square that measures 4.16 x 4.88 x 1 inches. There are several ports in the back: one for the USB cable for set up via a Mac or PC or the power adapter, and two IR mini blaster ports for extended coverage to devices behind cabinets. In the bottom center of the front of the hub, there’s an LED light that indicates whether it’s connected, powered on, pairing, or syncing with the remote or mobile app. The hub is the primary liaison between all devices and the remote. It connects with the remote through RF signals and communicates with specific equipment through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or infrared signals, depending on the type of device.  

 

While those are the two major hardware components, they’re also really designed to work around the mobile app and the MyHarmony software on a Mac or PC.

##   Setup Process: Not lightning quick and a little clumsy   
 

At first blush, it seems that setting up the Harmony Companion will be a breeze. Simply plug the hub in near your entertainment setup and download the Harmony app. We plugged in our hub and visited the App Store to download the app, but when we tried to connect to the Hub it hung for about five minutes. 

 

At this point, we decided to try the desktop software for Mac and that did the trick. We connected the hub to our computer via the provided Micro-USB cord and were able to connect to our Wi-Fi network, enter our Harmony account info, and move forward with the steps to start adding devices and what Harmony calls activities. These are basically the actions you designate to certain one-touch buttons on the remote. 

 

The Harmony app also recognized the hub at this point and the MyHarmony software directed us to complete setup in the app. This is a key example of the confusing and somewhat clunky relationship between the Harmony app and the MyHarmony desktop software. While you do have the power to add devices and assign actions through the Harmony app, the MyHarmony software holds the key to changing any physical remote control button assignments beyond the three quick-activity buttons at the top of the device. This makes for a sort of fractured setup and customization experience. 

 

But once you understand where the controls and functions can be accessed, it’s as easy as hitting the Sync button in the Harmony app to update the Harmony hub with any changes you’ve made to remote functions. The Sync button is located in a slightly weird spot, however, under Harmony Setup in the app.

 
##   Performance/Software: Responsive but a little quirky  
 

We already touched on the strange relationship between the Harmony mobile app and the MyHarmony desktop software, but there are definitely strengths to acknowledge as well. Even though the desktop software looks quite dated, it’s really easy to navigate, and easier to manage than a massive list of devices in the app.

 

It’s also the place to control the activity buttons, the three main buttons at the top of the remote, and to customize any of the other regular remote buttons. This process is very manual and can be tedious, but it’s helpful for seeing what activity you’ve assigned to a particular button or for undoing changes and reassigning functions. Basic button assignments are very straightforward. 

 

Though there’s sometimes a slight lag, the remote is generally responsive. The short press versus long press inputs are a bit odd—pinning down the difference between them was awkward due to the extremely slight delay between the two. 

 

The Harmony app can replace the physical remote, which offers another layer of flexibility in terms of how you interact with devices. You can also use the handy gesture control feature through the app, which allows you to touch your smartphone screen and tap up or down for volume controls or whatever you like (it also allows you to customize the gestures). 

 
The Logitech Harmony Companion retails for $150, not a rock-bottom price, but reasonable for what’s on offer.
 

If you plan to introduce Alexa to the fold, you’ll need the Alexa app where you can enable the Harmony skill. That didn’t do the trick, though, and we had better luck adding another skill: Harmony - Secondary Hub. This allowed us to make requests we’d set up for our Harmony Companion by asking Alexa to act as a go-between. Posing questions such as “Alexa, ask Harmony to go to Roku” did exactly what the activity button assignment on the remote or the mobile app does. It was satisfying to experience this communication when it went off without a hitch. There were several times, however, when Alexa didn’t understand the prompt. Still, it was enjoyable and convenient to have hands-free access to switch on/off a TV or turn on a game console from another room.

 
##   Price: Not bad for the high-end remote field  
 

The Logitech Harmony Companion retails for $150, not a rock-bottom price, but reasonable for what’s on offer. You can enjoy many of the same features the flagship Harmony Elite offers, minus the touchscreen and charging dock (and the Harmony app’s gesture controls can serve as a worthy stand-in for the touchscreen for $200 less).
