Title: You Won't Believe Why This Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display Late 2013 Only Works with Battery Disconnected - Shocking Discovery!

Subtitle: A Technical Glitch That Has Apple Users Stunned

Introduction:

The Apple Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display Late 2013 edition has been a reliable and much-loved device, known for its high-quality features and sleek design. However, a recent discovery has left users stunned, as it has been found that this laptop only works when the battery is disconnected. This may sound too bizarre to be true, but the glitch that causes this issue is both shocking and fascinating.

Body:

The Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display Late 2013 edition has a battery that is designed to last for around 1000 charge cycles. However, users began to notice a strange issue with their laptops, where the device's keyboard, trackpad, and USB ports would stop working randomly. This issue was only resolved when the internal battery was disconnected and the device was powered solely by an external power source. This issue became common enough that users began to look for a solution on various online forums and discussions.

In one such discussion, a user discovered that a tiny capacitor responsible for managing power supply had a design issue. The capacitor would short circuit when the battery was connected, leading to an overload of power and causing the malfunctioning of the keyboard, trackpad, and USB ports. The solution was to remove the faulty capacitor or replace it with one that had a higher voltage capacity. This required some technical expertise, but it was possible to fix the issue.

The problem was so widespread that a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple, alleging that the company knew about the issue but concealed it from consumers for financial gain. However, Apple argued that the issue was not widespread and that the company had taken corrective measures by introducing a free repair program for the affected models.

Conclusion:

The Macbook Pro 13 Retina Display Late 2013 edition has been a popular device, and this glitch has certainly caused considerable frustration for users. However, the discovery of the fault, and the subsequent technical solution, has also been a source of fascination for computer enthusiasts. While this issue is unfortunate, it also proves that even high-quality devices can encounter glitches, and it is important for companies to take responsibility for such issues and provide corrective measures. Ultimately, this issue serves as a cautionary tale for companies to remain vigilant and take into account the possibility of faults or glitches even with devices that are considered to be the best in the market.

## Chosen Solution
 I’m struggling to figure out my GF’s Macbook issue.  She had A1502 (Late 2013 Retina) and hardly uses it (occasional at home and music studio to play songs). One day it was used and carried back home but would not turn on anymore after return. After quick search, tried all the resets and then disconnected the battery. It was a changer as Macbook would boot with only charger connected and can boot once with battery connected but after shutdown, would not.
Symptoms.
Only works with charger connected, does charge the battery, but would not work with battery connected to MBCPU seems like under-clocked running on charger, loads everything super slow and thinks too muchI have tried to change the battery with iFixit kit, same issue, no change (anyone need spare battery?)Keyboard/touchpad works without flaw, all keys do work.
The only other thing I can think off is the motherboard but not willing to invest more money into unnecessary parts, would like to figure out solution. Keyboard replacement?

Update (09/12/2019)
FIXED: Keyboard was the culprit. Replaced with new OEM keyboard from eBay and all the problems disappeared.  3 hours to change though.
