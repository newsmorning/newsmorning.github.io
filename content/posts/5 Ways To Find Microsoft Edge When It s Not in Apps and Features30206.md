# Lost Microsoft Edge? 5 Secret Ways to Rediscover It Without App Searching!

If you are a Windows 10 user, you must be familiar with Microsoft Edge – the default web browser that comes pre-installed with the Windows operating system. It is a faster, safer, and more efficient web surfing tool than its predecessor, the Internet Explorer. However, if you've lost it from the taskbar or Start menu, you might wonder how to get it back. 

Fortunately, there are several ways to rediscover your lost Microsoft Edge browser without resorting to app searching. Here are the top five secret ways to do it: 

## 1. Using the Run Command

One of the fastest ways to launch Microsoft Edge is to use the Run command. You can access it by pressing Windows key + R on the keyboard or by typing 'Run' into the Windows search box. Then, type 'msedge' (without quotes) into the Run command box and press Enter. Voila! Your Microsoft Edge browser will launch instantly.

## 2. Using Cortana

Cortana is a built-in virtual assistant for Windows 10 that can help you find apps, documents, and settings on your computer. If you have enabled it, you can simply ask Cortana to open Microsoft Edge for you. Just say 'Hey Cortana' (or click the microphone icon) and say 'Open Microsoft Edge' or 'Launch Edge'. Cortana will immediately open the Microsoft Edge browser for you.

## 3. Using the Task Manager

If Microsoft Edge is running in the background, you can use the Windows Task Manager to bring it to the foreground. Right-click on the taskbar and select 'Task Manager' from the menu. Look for the Microsoft Edge process (msedge.exe) in the 'Processes' tab and click on it. Then, click on the 'Switch To' button to bring the browser window to the front.

## 4. Using Keyboard Shortcuts

If you prefer to use keyboard shortcuts, you can use one to launch Microsoft Edge quickly. You can press Windows key + 1, Windows key + 2, etc. to launch the apps pinned to the taskbar in order (from left to right). The Microsoft Edge icon should be pinned to the taskbar by default, so you can use this shortcut to launch the browser without searching for it.

## 5. Using Start Menu

Finally, you can always use the Start menu to launch Microsoft Edge. Click on the Start button (or press the Windows key) and look for the Microsoft Edge tile on the right side of the menu. If you don't see it, you can scroll down the list of apps until you find it. Once you find it, click on it, and voila! Your browser is back.

In Conclusion

Losing Microsoft Edge can be frustrating, but with these five secret ways to rediscover it, you don't have to worry about it anymore. Use the Run Command, Cortana, Task Manager, keyboard shortcuts, or Start menu to launch the browser quickly and efficiently. Now you can enjoy all the benefits of Microsoft Edge and browse the web with ease.
