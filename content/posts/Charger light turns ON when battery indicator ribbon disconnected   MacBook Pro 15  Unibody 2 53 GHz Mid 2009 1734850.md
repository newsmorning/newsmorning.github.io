Title: You Won't Believe What Happens When You Disconnect This Ribbon on Your MacBook Pro!

Introduction:
MacBook Pro is one of the most advanced laptops available in the market today. It comes with state-of-the-art features making it a highly preferred choice for both professional and personal use. However, there are instances when users face technical issues, which require them to perform certain actions including disconnecting the ribbon inside the laptop. If you're wondering what happens when you detach this ribbon, then you're in the right place. In this article, we will discuss this specific issue in detail and provide you with the necessary information.

What is the ribbon inside MacBook Pro?
The ribbon is a delicate strip containing vital data used to operate the laptop's various parts such as the keyboard, touchpad, and the power button. It connects the laptop's motherboard to these parts and is critical to the proper functioning of your MacBook Pro.

Why would you need to disconnect the ribbon inside your MacBook Pro?
There can be different reasons why you may want to detach the ribbon inside your MacBook Pro. For instance, if your MacBook Pro's keyboard or touchpad stops working or malfunctioning, then you may have to perform this action. In certain cases, users may experience the laptop's power button not responding or not turning on, and in such cases, detaching and reattaching the ribbon may help solve the issue.

What happens when you disconnect the ribbon inside your MacBook Pro?
If you have to detach the ribbon inside your MacBook Pro, it's crucial to understand the potential consequences of this action. When you pull out the ribbon from the laptop's motherboard, it will disconnect the connection. This will cause the keyboard, touchpad, and power button to stop working. It's important to note that detaching the ribbon from an operating MacBook Pro can cause additional damage to the laptop, so you should never attempt to do this while the machine is powered on.

Is it safe to disconnect the ribbon inside MacBook Pro?
If you're confident about how to detach and reattach the ribbon inside your MacBook Pro or have taken assistance from an authorized technician, it is safe to perform this action. However, if you're not experienced or a trained technician, it's better to seek professional help rather than attempting it yourself.

Conclusion:
While there may be different reasons to detach the ribbon inside your MacBook Pro, it's essential to understand the potential consequences and perform this action only if you're confident or have taken technical assistance. Disconnecting the ribbon from an operating MacBook Pro can damage the machine and cause additional issues. Therefore, we recommend consulting with an authorized technician who can guide you through the process or perform the action safely for you.

## Chosen Solution
 I was replacing the DC-In Board connector and when I put everything back I notice the charger light turns ON but turns off when I connected the battery indicator ribbon. The battery is a replacement battery if that makes any difference? (Though this worked fine beforehand)
Also there’s nothing showing up at all on screen. I have not screwed in all the screws yet, but would this make a difference? Any help much appreciated

 You’ll need to replace the battery checker as it has a short in it (liquid damaged) Unibody MacBook Pro 15" Battery Indicator Board, Apple P/N 922-9033
