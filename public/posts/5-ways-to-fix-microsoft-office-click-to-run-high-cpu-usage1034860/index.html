However, if you see the folder eating up GBs of space, then you can open it and delete the different sub-folders that are older.</p><p>For instance, if you see folders from 2021, then you can delete them as we are currently in 2022. After you delete the older sub-folders, you can check with any of the Microsoft Office apps if they are working fine or not.</p><p>If the advices above haven&rsquo;t solved your issue, your PC may experience deeper Windows problems.
