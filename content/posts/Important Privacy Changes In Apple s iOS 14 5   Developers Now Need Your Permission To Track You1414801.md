Apple Drops Privacy Bombshell: iPhone Users Shocked to Discover Developers Now Need THEIR Permission to Track Them!

Apple has announced a major update to its operating system iOS 14, which is set to have huge implications for user privacy. The update includes a new feature called App Tracking Transparency that requires app developers to get user permission before tracking their activity using Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).

This change has already sent shock waves through the advertising industry, where tracking user activity for targeted advertising has long been accepted as standard practice. But for Apple consumers, the update has been an eye-opener, exposing the extent to which their data has been collected and used without their consent.

In the past, iPhone users had to manually disable tracking by going into their device's settings and navigating a maze of confusing options. Many users weren't even aware that they were being tracked until they noticed eerily personalized ads showing up on their social media feeds.

Now, with App Tracking Transparency, every time a user downloads an app, they will be prompted to give their explicit consent for the app developer to track them. This will shine a light on exactly which apps are tracking users, and give users the power to decide whether or not they want to allow it.

Facebook, which relies heavily on targeted advertising revenue, has been vocal in its opposition to the update, arguing that it will be detrimental to small businesses that rely on Facebook Ads to reach their target audience. However, Apple has responded by saying that the update is all about giving users control over their own data, and that it will ultimately improve the user experience.

The move is part of a larger trend of tech companies taking user privacy more seriously. Last year, Google announced plans to phase out third-party cookies on its Chrome browser, and many other companies are following suit. With growing concerns about data breaches and cyber attacks, it's becoming increasingly important for users to take control of their data and understand how it's being used.

In summary, Apple's App Tracking Transparency update is a major step forward for user privacy, and a wake-up call for anyone who thought their online activity was private. By giving users control over which apps can track them, Apple is empowering consumers and making it harder for companies to profit off their personal data. 
 
Hugo - Conclusion 
In conclusion, Apple's App Tracking Transparency update is a game-changer in the world of online privacy. It's a bold move that puts the power back in users' hands and forces app developers to be more transparent about their data practices. As data breaches become more common, and cyber threats become more sophisticated, it's crucial that users take control of their own data and understand how it's being used. Thanks to Apple, we're one step closer to a more privacy-focused future.

Apple is a customer-centric organization that takes its customer’s security and privacy with great concern. And that is why perhaps we find more apps embedded with malware on the App Store than the Google Play Store. To enhance their security and privacy policy, Apple will be introducing two new major changes on iOS 14.5. The 7th beta version of this update has already been released to developers which means that this update is just around the corner.
 
The major changes that we are about to see now were revealed by Apple during the Worldwide Developer Conference last year. These changes were the “Privacy Nutrition Labels” and the “App Tracking Transparency”.
 
### Privacy Nutrition Labels
 
This change has already started reflecting on the App Store as all the developers are supposed to update their apps. These labels are important because it forces the developers to reveal if any information would be collected by a particular app, what would be collected and how & where the data would be used. Hence Apple users need to read and understand this information before downloading/installing any app.
 
In other words, you cannot blame Apple for any app that collects your information as this detail has already been specified.
 
### App Tracking Transparency
 
The next change that is going to feature in iOS 14.5 update is another way to safeguard the privacy of Apple users. This feature requires every developer to request permission from the user before they can track them. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook said that ATT is coming in “just a few weeks now. Probably more important than when it arrives, is what it’s meant to do.”
 
This change has been criticized by Facebook as it will have a major effect on the advertising industry. However, Apple remains firm on its stand against apps that track user data and information.  It also believes that most users do not have a clue about their information being collected and used and this feature will educate every user in the process. The process is going to be very simple as the users would receive a simple pop-up asking them about the tracking permissions. If the users reply positively then things go on as they did but if chosen otherwise the tracking would turn off concerning a particular app only.
 
#### Bonus Feature: iPhone Unlock with Apple Watch
 
Another feature that can be pretty useful to the situation the world is facing on a global level is unlocking your iPhone with Apple Watch. Users with FaceID activated cannot unlock their iPhone if they are wearing a mask. Hence, Apple will be introducing a new feature via iOS 14.5 update which when detects that the user is wearing a mask, will search for an Apple Watch nearby. If this Apple Watch is within range and has been unlocked by your iPhone even once then it will unlock the iPhone instantly.
 
To summarize, I think both the major changes of Privacy Nutrition Labels and App Tracking Transparency are two sides of the same coin which is to improve the privacy of the users by taking their permission to collect data and informing them as to how this information will be used. This gives Apple users control over their personal information which should not have been collected in the first place.
 
However, although Apple will be rolling out this feature soon, the real protection of your private information is in your hands for you will have to read the labels before granting developers, any sort of permission to collect your data. This update will be applicable on all new apps and will be implacable on already existing apps when they release an update. Let us see how Google responds to this new policy and wait until it applies a similar set of rules on Its Play Store.
