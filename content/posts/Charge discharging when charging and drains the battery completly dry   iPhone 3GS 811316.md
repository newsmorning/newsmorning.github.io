Title: The iPhone 3Gs Charging Dilemma - Why It is Draining Battery Completely Dry

Are you still using the iPhone 3Gs? If yes, then you might have already noticed a strange problem with its charging process. It appears that the old iPhones are having a hard time being charged nowadays. As a matter of fact, some users have reported that charging their iPhone 3Gs devices are causing the battery to drain completely dry.

This unexpected behavior has left many iPhone 3Gs users frustrated and puzzled. So, what is causing this problem? Is it a hardware issue, a software glitch, or some unknown factor?

After doing some research, we've discovered that there are several probable causes behind the iPhone 3Gs charging problem. Here are some of the most frequent reasons why the battery is draining when charging:

1. Outdated Batteries

The iPhone 3Gs was released back in 2009 which means that it's battery is already ten years old. With time, the batteries in such devices become less efficient and can start to develop battery drainage issues. Hence, the old batteries in these iPhones might have reached their expiry date which is causing this problem to occur.

2. Software Issues

Another possible cause behind the iPhone 3Gs charging issue might be related to some software bug in the iPhone's operating system. If not properly configured, the software can cause the device to reset itself or behave unexpectedly, causing power drain.

3. Faulty Charging Cables

If the device's charging cable is worn out or damaged, it may cause connectivity issues which can create power discharges. It's possible that the charging cable may get loose from time to time and cause disconnection issues, which lead to the battery draining quickly.

4. Inefficient Charging Technology

Lastly, due to the device's age, the iPhone 3Gs uses an old charging technology that was prevalent back in 2009. So, an inefficient charging system fitted in the device might be causing power drainage issues while charging.

The iPhone 3Gs is almost a decade old, so it isn't surprising that users are experiencing some technical issues with their devices. However, there are still ways to solve these problems. You can try buying new batteries or replace your iPhone's charging cable. If that doesn't work, it's best to visit an Apple store or authorized repair center for assistance.

In the end, the iPhone 3Gs is a classic device that has stood the test of time. It might be outdated in terms of features, but it still holds a special place in the hearts of many Apple lovers. Until the iPhone 3Gs has been phased out completely, we can expect users to continue to use it and face new challenges along the way. As we all know, nothing lasts forever, and even the latest models have their own issues. So, this is one of those challenges that iPhone 3Gs users need to face and find solutions to.

## Chosen Solution
 i changed my charging port in my iphone 3gs and the phone works perfectly but when i tried to charge my phone my phones battery gets discharging slowly, but my phone is being detected by itunes,    HELP ME

 Stalone,
Your symptoms have me guessing 2 things.
1: Something is not connected or reassembled correctly, possibly causing a short and resulting in the discharging that you are describing.
2: It's possible that your charging fuse is blown (possibly caused by a short?)
Disassemble your phone again and reassemble, being especially mindful of any contacts that may touch the frame or case that shouldn't. While you're in there, check your fuses. See oldturkey's answer for fuse location.

 I have this similar problem with my Samsung s5...I have tried all means it couldn't work not until 1day that I charged it with the back cover removed...till now (going to 3months) I didn't experience such problems again

 I think i have the Same problem with ms 3GS 32GB. I wanted to charge my iPhone and when i connected it with the dock-cable it makes a short "beep" and the display gets dark. My repair-service has changed the battery 4 times and also the dock-connector. It don't charge. I tryed another service and they told me: the logicboard is broken. ( the fuses are o.k., i checked them )
And finally the said: there some non-origin Apple-Parts build in. We don't fix it. Because of the warrenty. Warrenty? For a 3,5 Year old iPhone? I'm not interested in a,I want a working phone.
But that's another story....

 I have same problem with my Iphone 5, after water damage I opened and cleaned the main board, everything is working but it is discharging while charging. when I plugged in the charger iphone shows Lightning symbol like it is charging but in fact, percentage goes down.
Tried to replace Battery and Dock connector - but didnt help.
Anyone know what on board can be the reason for this?
Thank you.!

 I'm having the same problem! My s3 got water damaged but I'm not sure if thats anything to do with the problem but its charging really slowly and the battery pecentage go down even when charging and it stays on the same pecentage for ages . It only charges fully when I don't touch or use the phone. This same problem happened before a few months ago but I stopped charging it for a few days and used a universal charger and I even tried a new usb cable and battery they didn't work. But after Using the universal charger for about a week I used a decent charger my brother had for his Plus 1 phone and it started working again. But the problems came back and its not the cable or battery I've even cleaned the port. :( I can't return it back because I've had it for months and it has no warranty

 I have this problem too. Maybe it's an issue with the dock because the iPhone charges when I plug into my computer.
Update (04/04/2016)
I changed the part that plugs into the wall -problem solved.

 Maybe your cable is bad. Change it as well and make sure not to charge any other devices using  your port in the future.

 i  think its because is acting like an ass'

 On that tecno g9 discharge issue, I have 100% solution to it and you still the ideal
For any other phone that have the same problem of discharging while charging it.

 It happened to me too, all I did took the Battery out and back again after few minutes and it started charging
