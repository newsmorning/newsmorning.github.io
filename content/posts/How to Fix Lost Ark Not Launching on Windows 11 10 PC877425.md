# Lost Ark Game Not Launching on Your PC? Fear Not, Here's the Ultimate Fix for Windows 11 & 10 Users!

Are you an avid gamer and have been eagerly waiting for the launch of Lost Ark? Have you been waiting for months to play this game and cannot seem to get it to launch on your PC? Fear not, as we have come up with the ultimate solution to solve this problem for all Windows 11 and 10 users.

Lost Ark is an MMORPG game that has taken the gaming world by storm. It boasts of a rich narrative, immersive gameplay, and excellent graphics. However, despite its many accolades, some players have been experiencing issues when trying to launch the game on their Windows 11 and 10 PCs.

## Common Problems with Lost Ark

Before we dive into the ultimate fix, let's explore some of the common problems that players face when launching the game on their PCs.

1. Lost Ark crashes on startup - this is a common problem that players encounter when they try to launch the game. The game either crashes or freezes, preventing them from accessing it.

2. Lost Ark closes after launch - some players get to the game's launch screen but are unable to play it as it closes immediately.

3. The game doesn't respond - this occurs when players try to click on the game but nothing happens, making it impossible to play.

## The Ultimate Fix

Now, let's tackle the ultimate fix that will solve all these problems and get Lost Ark running smoothly on your Windows 11 and 10 PC.

The first step is to ensure that your PC meets the game's minimum system requirements. Lost Ark requires at least an Intel Core i3-8100 CPU, an NVIDIA GTX 650Ti GPU, 4 GB of RAM, and a minimum of 60 GB of free disk space.

If your PC meets these requirements, the next step is to check if your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Outdated drivers can prevent the game from launching or cause crashes. Visit your GPU manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers for your graphics card.

The next step is to ensure that your Windows 11 and 10 operating system is up-to-date. To do this, go to your Windows settings and check for updates. Installing the latest updates can fix any bugs or compatibility issues that may be preventing the game from launching.

Another common issue is that some antivirus programs or firewalls can prevent the game from launching, causing it to crash. Disabling or white-listing Lost Ark in your antivirus or firewall settings can solve this problem.

Lastly, try running the game in compatibility mode for Windows 8 or earlier. To do this, right-click on the Lost Ark icon, select properties, and navigate to the compatibility tab. Select 'Windows 8' or an earlier version from the drop-down menu and hit 'apply' and 'okay.'

## Conclusion

Lost Ark is an incredible game, and we hope that with our ultimate fix guide, you can start playing it without any hitch. If you experience any issues, remember to check your PC's compatibility, update your drivers and operating system, whitelist the game in your security software, and run it in compatibility mode. Happy gaming!

## Ways to Fix Lost Ark Not Launching On Windows PC
 
Now you are already well informed of the probable problem causes. We’ll go on to the below solutions, which should enable you to resolve the issue.
 
### 1. Check Your System’s Requirements To Run Lost Ark Smoothly
 
You should first determine whether your System configuration satisfies the game’s system requirements. A PC with incompatible hardware may occasionally cause several problems when a game first launches. Therefore, make sure your PC meets the system requirements for Lost Ark.
 
- Operating System: Windows11 or 10
 - Processor/CPU:Should be an Intel Gen 3 or An AMD Gen 3 CPU
 - RAM:Minimum of 8GB
 - Graphics:At least AMD HD 6850 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460 Graphics Card
 - Video Ram:A minimum of 2GB
 - Direct X Version:Version 9.0c or above
 - Storage:80GB (SSD)

 
To check your system’s configuration regarding playing Lost Ark, just follow these steps:
 
- Press the “Windows” key with the “R” key to launch the “RUN” dialogue box.
 - Now type “dxdiag” into the RUN dialogue box and press “OK” or “Enter/”.
 - A “Direct X Diagnostic Tool” window will appear in front of you.
 - Check both System And Graphics information in the “System” & “Display” tabs.

 

 
### 2. Update your Operating System
 
Using an old OS version can be problematic and interfere with modern games. It is crucial to check for the most recent Windows updates to correctly launch the game because an outdated Windows version may interfere with the game installation files.
 
To do so, follow these steps:
 
- Press the Windows key with the key “I” to launch the “Windows Settings” menu.
 - At the bottom of the table on the left side of the Window, locate and tap on “Windows Update.”
 - Now in the Windows Update section, click on the “Check for Updates” button.
 - If a feature update is available, choose Download and install.
 - After installing the pending updates, restart your PC and check if the problem is resolved or not.

 
### 3. Disable your Microsoft Defender Firewall and Virus & Threat Program Temporarily
 
Occasionally, specific programs and games may clash with your antivirus program. It often occurs when your antivirus program detects what appears to be a “virus” in your game files & terminates it. This indicates that a “false positive” has caused your antivirus software to activate.
 
To disable your antivirus & defender firewall, just follow these steps:
 
- Press the Windows key with the key “I” to launch the “Windows Settings” menu.
 - At the bottom of the table on the left side of the Window, locate and tap on “Privacy & Security.”
 - Select the “Windows Security” option.
 - Now click on “Firewall & Network Protection” from the table on the right side.
 - Ensure that the Domain, Private, and Public Network Settings checkboxes are set to Turn off Windows Firewall.
 - Click each and toggle the slide button to the “Off” position.
 - Restart the system to make the changes and check if the problem is resolved or not.

 
After making changes in the Windows Firewall protection, make sure you disable the “Virus & Threat Protection too. Follow these steps:
 
- Press the Windows key with the key “I” to launch the “Windows Settings” menu.
 - At the bottom of the table on the left side of the Window, locate and tap on “Privacy & Security.”
 - Select the “Windows Security” option.
 - Now click on “Virus & Threat Protection” from the table on the right side.
 - Tap “Manage Settings” under the “Virus & threat protection settings.”
 - Now “Turn Off” the “Real-Time Protection.”
 - Once finished, restart your computer to make the changes.

 
### 4. Run Lost Ark game as an Administrator
 
If you don’t run your game with administrator privileges, it can have problems loading, starting, or even crashing during setup. Sometimes not having administrative access also hinders the game, and you will get the pop-up message saying “Lost Ark won’t launch” or Lost Ark not launching on your computer screen. Therefore, it’s best to launch the game’s .exe file as an administrator on your system to see if it resolves the issue.
 
- Head over to your Lost Ark installation file in your computer’s download folder.
 - Locate the “LOSTARK.exe” file and “right-click” on it.
 - Now click on “properties” from the tab.
 - Under properties, select the “Compatibility” tab and click the checkbox before “Run this program as an administrator.”
 - Tap on “Apply” and press the “Ok” button to save the changes.

 
###  5. Close Any Unnecessary Background Apps/tasks
 
One of the most frequent causes of Lost Ark failing to open on Windows 10 or earlier versions is running too many apps in the background. To resolve this, close any programs that you no longer need.
 
- Press the “Ctrl” key + “Shift” key + “Esc” key all together to open “Task Manager.”
 - Find the application you wish to end within the Task Manager pane and right-click on it.
 - Select it, then click “End Task”. Make sure to follow the instructions for each activity separately.

 
After that, restart your computer and play the game once more to see whether the problem still exists.
 
### 6. Update Your Graphics Card Drivers
 
Driver-related problems frequently affect games. More precisely, problems with Lost Ark, such as Lost Ark won’t launch, may occur if you run outdated graphics drivers. Therefore, you should constantly maintain your GPU drivers up to date with their most recent versions if you want to experience the finest gaming performance.
 
You may manually upgrade the drivers from the graphics card manufacturer’s website.  If you don’t have the patience or computer knowledge to upgrade your graphics drivers manually, you can use Advanced Driver Updater to do it for you.
 
Advanced Driver Updater can quickly check for missing or damaged drivers and out-of-date drivers on your computer. Advanced Driver Updater searches your system for out-of-date, inappropriate drivers which need to be upgraded using a powerful scan engine.
 
Additionally, this program gathers details about the hardware, such as the manufacturer and version, and looks for the best appropriate driver. Compared to manually updating the drivers using the device manager, this saves significant time and work.
