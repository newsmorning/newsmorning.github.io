# Revolutionize Your Charging Experience: The Secret to Transforming Your USB Type C Connector into an Unstoppable Powerhouse!

USB Type C connectors have become popular in recent years, thanks to their many benefits such as faster charging, data transfer, and their reversible design which makes plugging in your device much easier. However, not all USB Type C cables are created equal, and many users often face frustratingly slow charging times or inconsistent power output. But fear not! With a few tips and tricks, you can revolutionize your charging experience and transform your USB Type C connector into an unstoppable powerhouse!

## Invest in a High-Quality USB Type C Cable

The first step in revolutionizing your charging experience is investing in a high-quality USB Type C cable. While it may be tempting to opt for a cheap, no-name brand cable, these often have poor build quality and may not support fast charging or data transfer rates. Look for cables from reputable brands such as Anker, Belkin, or Aukey, that are certified to meet USB-IF standards. These higher-quality cables are made from durable materials and come with features such as braided cords, reinforced connectors, and support for Power Delivery (PD) charging.

## Optimize Your Device Settings

Another way to enhance your charging experience is by optimizing your device settings. Many smartphones and laptops have built-in power-saving modes that reduce the device's power consumption, but also slow down charging times. Make sure to turn off power-saving modes when you need to charge your device quickly, and reduce the number of background apps running to prevent unnecessary power drain.

## Use a High-Power Charger

A crucial part of the charging experience is the charger itself. Many devices come with a standard USB Type C charger that outputs around 5-10 watts of power, which may not be enough for fast charging or powering accessories such as external hard drives or monitors. To truly revolutionize your charging experience, invest in a higher-powered charger that supports Power Delivery. These chargers can output up to 100 watts of power, enabling your device to charge much faster and power additional devices simultaneously.

## Consider a USB Type C Hub

Finally, if you're still having trouble with slow charging times or inconsistent power output, consider investing in a USB Type C hub. These hubs add additional ports to your device, allowing you to connect multiple peripherals such as external displays, hard drives, and keyboards. They also often come with an integrated charger, providing enough power to support all connected devices and keep your device charging at full speed.

In conclusion, revolutionizing your charging experience takes more than just plugging your device into any USB Type C cable. Investing in a high-quality cable, optimizing your device settings, using a higher-powered charger, and considering a USB Type C hub can all help you transform your charging experience and make it an unstoppable powerhouse. With these tips and tricks, you can ensure that your devices always have the power they need when you need them most.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,My Hp Chromebook Type-C charger stopped working after a hard pull on the cable. I tore apart the connector and found out the cable just beneath the connector is damaged. I got a new connector but am confused which wire to connect where.Charger cable has 3 wires (White, Blue, Black) and the connector has 4 connection pads (G, D+, D-, V). I checked voltage between all wires and got:
White - Blue = 2.9VWhite - Black = 0VBlack - Blue = 2.9V
Make matter even more confusing the original connector has nine pins (yes not eight), five pins on 'top' (A1, A4, A8, A9, A12) and four pins on the 'bottom' side (B1, B4, B9, B12). I believe A8 is extra and does not do anything but who knows...
If you understand this please help me determine which wire should be soldered on which pad.
Here is a related question I found with similar charger with similar configuration. Repair connector on HP chargerThanks

 @oldturkey03 Agree 100%, the charger itself shows four different output voltages so it's pretty definite a control signal is needed.
As far as what goes where - that's a tougher question. I'm guessing blue is the V connection, and black is usually ground or the G pad. That would leave white as the D+, but of course then where is D-? You could check for continuity between D- and G on the Chromebook; if there's no resistance between the two then it's a good bet you don't need D- as long as G is present.
Another way to check would be to go back to the other end of the wires and see what they're connected to. That would mean opening up the power brick and tracing down the three wires to their source. I'm betting two of them will be together on a power board; those will be V & G. The other one should go to some kind of logic circuit that'll be controlling the output voltage.
With all that in mind, it's also possible that if there's a braided sheath over the three wires, it may also be part of the circuit. On Apple MagSafe chargers, that's actually the ground wire and you have to unbraid it then twist it together into a single wire for use as the ground connection. If that's what you find inside the power supply then the sheath should be G instead and the other non-power wire (black, probably) would go to D-.
As you can see, that's a non-standard setup; the wiring colors don't correspond to common USB cable usage, and the three wire configuration is just confusing things.
I'd love for anyone else knowledgeable about this sort of thing to jump in here and add your thought, since I'm mostly guessing at what's what.

 Hi @omi236,
Here's a link that shows the pinout for a USB-C connector.
There's communication between the host and the device when using USB-C so that the host knows how much power it can supply, if the device can accept it that is, otherwise it defaults to the standard USB 5V value.
The 2.9V reading is too low. Is this measured directly between batt and ground output of charger i.e. open circuit voltage? It should be a minimum of 5V.
The D+ and D- are the data lines.
