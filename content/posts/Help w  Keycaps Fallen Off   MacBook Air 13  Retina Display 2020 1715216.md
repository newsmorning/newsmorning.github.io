Is your Macbook Air falling apart? Find out how to fix your W keycaps now!

If you own a Macbook Air, you know how important the keyboard is to your daily productivity. Unfortunately, with extended use, the keycaps can start to come loose or even break off, making it difficult or impossible to use your keyboard.

Thankfully, you don't need to be a computer expert to fix this problem. With a few simple steps, you can replace the W keycaps and have your keyboard functioning like new again. Here's what you need to do:

Step 1: Gather your materials

To fix your W keycaps, you'll need a few tools to get started. First, you'll need a replacement W keycap. You can purchase these keycaps online, or you can try contacting Apple for a replacement if your Macbook is still under warranty.

You'll also need a flathead screwdriver, a pair of tweezers, and a plastic opening tool. You can purchase these tools online or find them at your local electronics store.

Step 2: Remove the damaged keycap

To remove the damaged W keycap, use the flathead screwdriver to gently pry it off the keyboard. Be careful not to damage the surrounding keys or the keyboard itself. Once the keycap is removed, use the tweezers to pull off any remaining pieces or debris.

Step 3: Install the replacement keycap

Using the plastic opening tool, carefully snap the replacement keycap into place. Make sure it lines up with the surrounding keys and sits evenly on the keyboard. Use the tweezers to adjust any minor misalignments if necessary.

Step 4: Test your keyboard

After installing the new W keycap, test your keyboard to ensure that it's functioning properly. Type out a few words or sentences, and make sure the keycap is responsive and works smoothly.

If you encounter any issues or the problem persists, you may need to contact Apple for further assistance or take your Macbook to a repair shop.

In conclusion

Fixing a loose or broken W keycap on your Macbook Air is a simple process that anyone can do with the right tools and a little bit of patience. By following these steps, you can have your keyboard functioning like new again and get back to your daily work and productivity.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi! I wanted to convert my MacBook Air to a Colemak layout so I started by popping off the N key to start and tried putting them back in my I am struggling a lot with the top hooks on the keycaps. Nothing was broken and snapped (to my eye). The key still fits back on and works like normal but it doesn’t pop up like the other ones and just stays flat. If possible, I want to fix it myself and not bring it to the apple stores because I am quite busy and booking and waiting is just a pain.

I’m suspecting you snapped the small fragile hooks on the keycap so the scissor action is not working properly. Sadly, you’ll need a new key cap if the hooks are damaged.
