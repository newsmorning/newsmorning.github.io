# You won't believe what happens after you load a CD/DVD into your Apple USB Superdrive - get ready to be shocked!

Apple's USB Superdrive is a popular external device that allows Mac users to play and burn CDs and DVDs. But what happens when you load a CD or DVD into your Superdrive? You might be surprised to learn that there are a few things that can happen, some of which can be quite unexpected.

## Automatic playback

One of the most common things that happens when you load a CD or DVD into your Superdrive is that the disc will automatically start to play. This is especially true if the disc is a movie or music album. However, even if the disc contains software or other types of data, it may still trigger an automatic playback action.

## Error messages

Unfortunately, not every CD or DVD will load successfully into your Superdrive. If the disc is damaged or dirty, for example, you may see an error message indicating that the Superdrive can't read the disc. Sometimes, this can be fixed by cleaning the disc or using a different one. Other times, it may indicate a problem with your Superdrive itself.

## Software installation

Some CDs and DVDs contain software that can be installed on your Mac. When you load one of these discs into your Superdrive, you may see a prompt asking if you want to install the software. This can be a great way to install new applications or drivers without having to download them from the internet.

## Burning

Of course, not every CD or DVD you load into your Superdrive will be for playing or installing software. You may also use your Superdrive to burn data onto blank discs. In this case, you will need to use software like iTunes or iDVD to create the content you want to burn.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of things that can happen when you load a CD or DVD into your Apple USB Superdrive. Whether you're watching a movie, installing software, burning a disc, or troubleshooting an error message, your Superdrive is a versatile external device that has a lot to offer. So the next time you insert a disc into your Superdrive, pay attention to what happens - you might be surprised!

## Chosen Solution
 If I load a CD or DVD into the drive, it spins for about 5 seconds then spits it out. Help!

 Try different CDs and DVDs, superdrives that haven't been used for some time may become very picky, but once they start working things may get better. If it spits out disks it means it's unable to read them, usually that's due to a dirty lens. Easiest disks to read are the original music CDs, if it spits out those too, there's not much to do except tearing the superdrive apart and clean manually the inside. If if works with music CDs, next step would be to try using a lens cleaning CD.
