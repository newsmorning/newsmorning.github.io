# You Won't Believe What I Found Inside My Asus F556Uq Laptop: A Screw Drop that Could Have Destroyed Everything!

As a freelancer, my laptop is my most important tool for earning a living, so when it started making a strange noise, I knew I had to investigate. I turned my Asus F556Uq laptop upside down and gave it a good shake. And that's when I heard it. A tiny sound that was almost imperceptible. Was there something loose inside my laptop?

I nervously flipped open the back panel of the Asus F556Uq laptop and started to check things out. Everything seemed to be in place until...there it was, a tiny screw hanging in the air. The sight of it made my heart skip a beat. I knew it had to be from inside the laptop, and that could mean trouble.

As I examined the screw more closely, I wondered how it had managed to come loose. Was it a manufacturing defect? Was there something wrong with the design of the laptop? Or had someone opened it before and forgotten to put the screw back in?

Whatever the reason, I knew this tiny screw could wreak havoc on my laptop. It could cause the screen to crack, the motherboard to fry, or disable the keyboard. And that would have been catastrophic since I rely heavily on my laptop for work.

I took a few deep breaths before carefully extracting the screw and double–checking to make sure that everything was back in place. With a sigh of relief, I powered up the laptop and held my breath. Fortunately, it started up like a dream.

The experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of regular maintenance of laptops. Keeping your laptop clean and free of debris can prevent a whole host of issues from hardware malfunction to overheating.

It also made me realize the importance of choosing a quality laptop that is built to last. Fortunately, the Asus F556Uq is a durable laptop that can withstand the wear and tear of daily use. But not everyone is as lucky as I was. A screw malfunction could easily have ruined a laptop with lesser durability and quality.

In conclusion, it pays to be vigilant about laptop maintenance by checking for loose screws or debris regularly. It's also critical to invest in a quality laptop that can endure the wear and tear of daily use. Taking care of your laptop can save you from losing thousands of dollars and lots of important work.


## Chosen Solution
 My laptop already lost 2 Screws, one near the screen and the other one at the bottom part. Today i just found another screw fall from my laptop and i’m sure it doesn’t fit the missing two. This one looks smaller and quite short. Any idea which one is it? Or does anyone have a ‘blue print’ which screw belongs where? Thanks.

 I was wondering if anyone has worked on your laptop lately? If so, they may have put the screws in incorrectly.
Another possibility is that the remount screw anchors have broken and causing the screws to fall.
I am including images as well for you to look at.
