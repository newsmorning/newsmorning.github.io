## You won't believe how I finally got my wireless mouse working on Windows 10 Dell Precision M4300 - the solution is a game changer!


Recently, I had been facing a major problem with my wireless mouse that I had bought to use with my Dell Precision M4300 laptop running on Windows 10. Despite numerous attempts, I was unable to get it working on my laptop, which was not only annoying but also time-consuming.

I had tried all the standard solutions like changing the batteries, checking the connection of the USB receiver, and even reconnecting the mouse multiple times, but nothing worked. I even tried downloading and installing the latest driver for my mouse, but that too was of no use.

That's when I realized that I needed to take a different approach to solve the issue, and started digging into the settings of my laptop. After a few hours of research, I stumbled upon a solution that changed the game for me forever.

The problem, as it turned out, was that the laptop's Bluetooth was interfering with the wireless mouse, causing it to malfunction. So, I followed these simple steps to disable the Bluetooth on my laptop:

1. Go to the Device Manager by searching for it in the Windows search bar or by right-clicking the Windows icon in the taskbar and selecting it from the menu.
2. In the Device Manager, locate the Bluetooth option and click on it to expand it.
3. Right-click on the Bluetooth adapter and select the 'Disable device' option from the menu.
4. Restart your laptop to apply the changes.

Once I followed these steps, my wireless mouse started working like a charm. No more lag or unresponsiveness. It was a revelation, and I was ecstatic that I finally found a solution to my problem.

If you're facing a similar issue with your wireless mouse, especially on a Dell Precision M4300 running on Windows 10, then you might want to give this solution a try. It might just be the game changer you need to get your wireless mouse working again.

In conclusion, the solution I found to the problem of my wireless mouse not working on my Windows 10 Dell Precision M4300 laptop was disabling the Bluetooth adapter. It's a simple fix, but it can make all the difference in the world. So, if you're struggling with your wireless mouse, don't give up hope. Try this solution, and you might just be pleasantly surprised!

 how do I set up my wireless mouse my dell laptop please and thank you

 You plug in the dongle to the Computer and turn on the charged up mouse.

 no this didn't work , I've been trying to set the up now for the longest time

 Texxi's suggestion only functions if your mouse is designed with plug and play drivers for window's 10. some items do not have that.
In order for plug and play to work, you will also need an internet connection on your PC as well, so that windows can download the drivers for you.
you may also have to Manually run Windows Update with "Optional Updates" through the Start menu to get it running.
Specifically, you will have to go to your mouse's support website, and find the manual driver installation package for windows 10. This is assuming your device specifically is designed for use with windows 10. if it is not compatible with the OS, it will not work.
