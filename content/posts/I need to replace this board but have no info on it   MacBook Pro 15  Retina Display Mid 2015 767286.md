As a MacBook Pro user, you probably love the performance and sleek design the laptop offers. But like with any electronic device, things can go wrong. One of the most common issues MacBook Pro owners encounter is a malfunctioning logic board. This can be a major problem as the board controls the computer's core functions and performance.

If you're experiencing issues with your MacBook Pro, it's possible that the logic board needs to be replaced. However, many people are unaware of how to do this and often leave the task to the professionals.

But what if we told you that replacing your MacBook Pro's logic board is easier than you might think? With a little bit of know-how and some basic tools, you can do it yourself and save yourself the cost of paying a professional.

In this article, we'll take a look at the steps you need to follow to replace the logic board on your MacBook Pro. We'll also highlight some common mistakes to avoid along the way.

# The Tools You Need

Before you begin, you'll need a few tools to help with the process. Here's a list of what you'll need:

- A set of Torx screwdrivers
- A set of Phillips screwdrivers
- A spudger or flathead screwdriver
- A replacement logic board

# Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you have all the necessary tools, let's take a look at the steps you need to follow to replace the logic board.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace

Before you start, ensure that you have a clean, well-lit workspace. This will ensure that you can see everything clearly and work effectively. Additionally, remove any static electricity by grounding yourself or using an anti-static mat.

## Step 2: Remove the Bottom Case

Flip your MacBook Pro over and use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the ten screws that are holding the bottom case in place. Make sure to keep these screws in a safe place, as you'll need them again later.

Once the screws are removed, gently lift the bottom case out of its position.

## Step 3: Remove the Battery Connector

Using a spudger or flathead screwdriver, carefully disconnect the battery connector from the logic board. This will ensure that you don't accidentally power on your MacBook Pro during the repair process.

## Step 4: Remove the Logic Board Screws

Now that the battery connector is disconnected, it's time to remove the screws that are holding the logic board in place. Use a Torx screwdriver to remove the six screws that are located around the edge of the logic board.

## Step 5: Disconnect the Connections

Once the screws are removed, gently lift the logic board up and disconnect the various connections that are attached to it. This includes cables for your keyboard, touchpad, camera, and display.

## Step 6: Install the New Logic Board

Take your new logic board and follow the steps in reverse to install it. Connect all the cables and secure the logic board with the screws removed in Step 4. Finally, connect the battery connector.

Once everything is securely in place, it's time to test your MacBook Pro to ensure that everything is working as it should be. If everything looks good, it's time to reattach the bottom case and screw it back into place.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

While replacing your MacBook Pro's logic board is a fairly simple process, there are a few common mistakes to avoid. These include:

- Rushing the process and breaking or losing screws
- Failing to wear an ESD wrist strap, which can damage your computer
- Mishandling the logic board, which is delicate and easily damaged

By following the steps outlined in this article and taking your time, you can successfully replace your MacBook Pro's logic board and get your laptop working like new again.

As a MacBook Pro user, encountering issues with the logic board can be frustrating. But by following the steps outlined in this article, you can quickly and easily replace the board yourself, saving yourself time and money.

## Chosen Solution
 This board got wet and is corroded and I need to replace it but can find no info on it or part number.  I don’t really want to have to buy a whole upper case to get one.  Does anyone know what it’s called or have a part number for it or where to get one?

 @mayer - is this what you need? MacBook Pro 15" Retina (Mid 2015) Trackpad. Click on the right image.

 The board comes with the trackpad, it’s the controller of the force touch, you see those two flats are soldered.
It’s a mess to desolder, they melt too quickly, i tried is a nightmare..
Can you not just unglue the middle bit of battery cells and take out the trackpad?
Emil

 Looks like it can’t be done.  After the board is unglued and lifted up there are ribbon cables (the clear ones)that run onto the trackpad that can’t be disconnected at the board.  Will update later after I have full access to the trackpad
