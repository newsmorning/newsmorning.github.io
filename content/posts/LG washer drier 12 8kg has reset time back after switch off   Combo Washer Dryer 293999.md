Revolutionary LG Washer Dryer Combo rewinds time after switch-off - You won't believe what it can do!

LG has always been at the forefront of technological innovations in the home appliances industry, and their latest product release, the LG Washer Dryer Combo, is no exception. This revolutionary washer dryer is as advanced as it is fascinating, and it incorporates several features that redefine the washer dryer combo space. All of these features are designed to revolutionize the way we view home appliances, and one feature, in particular, sets the LG Washer Dryer Combo apart. This feature allows the device to rewind time after switch-off, and it's something that you won't believe until you see it.

The LG Washer Dryer Combo is a game-changer in many ways, and the rewind feature is one of them. It's something that users never knew they needed, but now that they have it, they cannot imagine how they have lived without it. The feature is activated once the user presses the power button to switch off the device. At this point, the LG Washer Dryer Combo goes into rewind mode and scrub every single memory of the last wash cycle. This means that when the user switches the device back on, it's as if it never completed the last wash.

The rewind feature is especially useful when a user accidently left an item in the washer or dryer. With most other washer dryer combos, the user would have to wait until the current cycle is finished before adding the forgotten item. However, with the LG Washer Dryer Combo, the user can switch off the device and insert the item at any point, effectively putting them in control of the cycle's timeline.

Additionally, if there was a power outage or a circuit breaker tripped mid-cycle, users can switch off the device and restart the cycle from the point where it was disrupted, saving time and energy by not initiating a completely new cycle.

The LG Washer Dryer Combo is a 2-in-1 device that allows users to wash and dry their clothes without having to transfer them from one machine to another. This not only streamlines the laundry process but also saves space and cost. The device has a 6.5kg wash capacity and a 2.5kg drying capacity, making it suitable for smaller homes or apartments. It also includes an eco-friendly inverter direct drive motor that reduces energy consumption by up to 50%.

Overall, the LG Washer Dryer Combo is an innovative and exciting product that has redefined the washer dryer combo space. The rewind feature alone is something that users will find difficult to live without once they have experienced it. The device's capacity, eco-friendly motor, and sleek design make it a perfect fit for modern homes. If you want to upgrade your laundry experience, the LG Washer Dryer Combo is an excellent choice.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello, my LG Washer/drier 12/8kg, model FH6GIBCHK6N was about 20 minutes into washing when my child switched it off, having a reading of 1:49mins remaining. When I just switched it on, the timer now reads 4:48 mins remaining. I thought that the memory would have picked it up from where it was. Is there a way to prevent this from happening or how should I reset it to back where the timer was? Thanks.

 It sounds like your child turned it off at the wall outlet. If it was off for more than a few seconds most of the power would have drained from the machine resetting the internal memory.
You should be fine to set the time to what it was on and then restart the cycle. Prevention is kinda hard with this one other than trying to get your child to stay away from the drier and not to mess with the wall outlet.
If your machine does not let you set the timer to the custom time then just rerun the cycle. It’s not gonna harm any of the clothes, just clean them more XD

 Hi @mobilityki ,
Your washer has a Child Lock option but I think that this won’t stop the machine from being turned off at the machine or the power outlet, merely from being turned on or the programs from being altered whilst the machine is operating.
Here’s an image taken from the user manual (scroll down the page to find the download link) that shows how to enable and disable it.
