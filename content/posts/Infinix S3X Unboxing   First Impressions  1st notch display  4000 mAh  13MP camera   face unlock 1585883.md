One of Infinix’s most popular smartphones could have been the S2. It introduced a couple of game changing specs from its build, look & feel, and the new Wefie camera that could take wide angle selfies. This made it a people’s favorite. To follow it up, the S3 and later the S3X also introduce a couple of firsts. The S3X in particular is the first Infinix device to have a notch display which is one of the new trends in display technology. Think of it like having the iPhone X without having to break the bank.
 
The new notch display brings a whole new feeling and experience to your phone. Combined with the premium look and feel, it makes the S3X the perfect and most affordable lifestyle device on the market at the moment. The new S3X makes a for a good replacement device or a good first smartphone especially because it has all the basics and now introduces a few new things that make the device one worth looking at.

## Our First Impressions
 
Unboxing + Set Up: The box looked a lot like the S2 which was good because it looked familiar and we really loved the S2. There’s a photo of the S3X on top of the box placed right in the middle where you cannot miss it. It clearly shows off the notch display getting you excited about what is inside. Of course we couldn’t wait to open it up so we did. We quickly set it up and it was not that complicated to do. There’s even a new feature helping those switching from iOS to Android to transfer their contacts and key info.
 
Design + Look & feel: As for the design, we have a glass look and feel for the S3X back unfortunately it is not real glass but synthetic or plastic. That not withstanding, coupled with the notch screen, makes the S3X design premium. It feels great in your palms and is not too smooth to want to slide off your hands
 
Camera: Taking the camera for a ride, reveals a couple of things that selfie hunters and instagramers will love. There is the Portrait mode that effects a blury background when you take photos using the main camera. Secondly, the Selfie camera has a photo beautification effect that many pouting selfie lovers would die for. It literally clears and brightens your skin with less of your editing efforts. The camera also captures quite a lot of details
 
Battery: For starters, we elated that we have at least 4000 mAh of battery power to burn through. This is quite a sizeable battery in comparison to other phones on the market. Further still, there is a battery saver mode that turns part of the screen red to alert you that you are in battery saver mode. We are yet to ascertain how much of the battery this feature can save. We didn’t like the fact that you have to go to the settings to activate “Battery Saver” Mode. Also we didn’t see the proprietory X-Power app to optimize battery usage and consumption.
 
OS + Apps: For those who love their app drawers, fret not the S3X has an app drawer. What this means is that you can hot menu and get all the apps in one place other than the home screens. For those who aren’t fans of the new Android One and were probably used to Infinix’s xOS, the S3X would be your boy. We also get our X-Family of apps back except for a few.
 
Overall Performance: With 3GB of RAM, 32GB or memory, an octa-core processor and the fact the device is new, the overall performance was great with the device being fast (at least for the time that we had it). We hope to revisit the device after about 6 months to confirm if it still remains fast and fluid then.
 
Battery and camera all seems to impress with the notch display being the icing on the cake.
 
## Pros
 
- Notch display
 - Free Accessories ( Screen protector, Jacket)
 - 12 Months warranty
 - Affordable price
 - Available across the country

 
## Cons
 
- Specs are the same as the S3 except for the notch display
 - Plastic Design

 
## Infinix S3X Price & Availability
 
The Infinix S3X is available in all the dealer outlets and shops countrywide at the price of Ugx 715,000. Some of these shops include Banana Phone World, Rock Unlimited, Cross River, Hello Mobile, Phone City, Mob Phone and so many more. These shops are mainly along Kampala and Jinja Road and some are down town.
 
## The Verdict
 
At only Ugx 715,000 a notch display, good camera plus lovely design seem to be right on the money. We could have a loved a sharper display and a less plastic-ky design but I guess we shall have to keep those expectations for the Infinix flagship coming soon.
