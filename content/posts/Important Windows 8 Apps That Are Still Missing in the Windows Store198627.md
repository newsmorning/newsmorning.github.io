Title: Shocking Revelation: These Vital Windows 8 Apps Are NOWHERE To Be Found on Windows Store!

Introduction:
Windows 8 was a controversial operating system for Microsoft, but it had many unique features, including its app store. The Windows Store was designed to provide users with access to the latest and greatest apps developed specifically for the platform. However, some of the most vital Windows 8 apps are nowhere to be found on the Windows Store. In this article, we will discuss the most crucial Windows 8 apps that you cannot download from the Windows Store.

1. Windows Media Player:
Windows Media Player was an essential app for many users, offering simple and intuitive playback of music and videos. However, this app was removed from Windows 8 and replaced with the more modern Xbox Music and Video apps. While these new apps are fine, they lack the simplicity and straightforwardness of the old WMP.

2. Microsoft Office:
Microsoft Office is a necessary app for any productivity-focused user. However, the full version of Office is not available for download from the Windows Store. Instead, you can only download Office Mobile, which is a stripped-down version of the standard Office suite. While this app may be useful for some users, it is not a complete replacement for the full Office suite.

3. Windows Live Essentials:
Windows Live Essentials was a collection of free apps that were popular with many Windows 7 users. However, this suite of programs was not included in Windows 8, and none of the apps are available on the Windows Store. The most notable apps that are missing from Windows Live Essentials include Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Messenger, and Windows Live Writer.

4. Windows Photo Gallery:
For many users, Windows Photo Gallery was the go-to app for managing and editing photos. However, this app was also removed from Windows 8, and there is no comparable replacement available on the Windows Store. While the new Photos app in Windows 8 is fine for basic photo editing, it lacks the robust feature set of Windows Photo Gallery.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, while the Windows Store is a valuable resource for many apps and programs, it is missing some of the most essential Windows 8 apps. Windows Media Player, Microsoft Office, Windows Live Essentials, and Windows Photo Gallery are all vital programs that many users require access to. Unfortunately, they cannot be downloaded from the Windows Store, and users must look elsewhere to find and install them.

When Microsoft introduced Windows 8, the company also released Windows Store, a place from where you can download and install various apps and programs for your tablet, laptop or desktop. While Windows Store wants to be similar with Apple Store or Google Play, there are some important apps that are still missing from Microsoft’s own market.
The apps and programs that aren’t available in Windows Store, but can be found on Google Play for example, are important software that can ease your daily work and which can help you schedule your daily program, or why not, entertain you and your family. So, during the following lines I will list these apps that aren’t yet available on Windows Store; of course, we hope that each tool mentioned here will be eventually released for our Windows 8 based devices.

## Most relevant programs which aren’t yet available on Windows Store
 
- Pinterest: Even though on Windows Store we have third party apps that offer access to this social media network, the official Pinterest client isn’t officially released for Windows 8, Windows 8.1 or Windows RT users.
 - Google Calendar: In order to organize and schedule your daily activity you need to use a dedicated calendar app. While Google Calendar is the most popular app in that matter, on Windows Store you can’t find it, though there are several third party tools related to the same.
 - Pandora: This Internet Radio service has been recently made available for Windows Phone 8 devices, but the app is still messing for Windows 8 and Windows RT based tablets and desktops.
 - HBO GO: Unfortunately, if you own a Windows 8 based device you will not be able to watch your favorite movies from HBO, as HBO GO is still unavailable on Windows Store (you can stream HBO from your browser but you will not get a mobile-optimized interface) – instead you can use Hulu Plus.
 - Pocket: If you want to get in touch with everything that’s new by using Pocket, a dedicated app in that matter, you will not be able to do so, as the tool is still unavailable on Windows Store.
 - Spotify: Similar with Pandora, Spotify is available for Windows Phone 8 handsets, but no for Windows 8 and Windows RT tablets and desktops.
 - Instagram: As you might have noticed, the official Instagram client isn’t released on Windows Store, though you can any time use other dedicated third party tools.
 - Google Drive, Google Maps or YouTube: Google will not release dedicated Windows 8 apps for its own services, so Google Drive, Google Maps and even YouTube can’t be downloaded from Windows Store.

 
These are only few apps that are available on Google Play or Apple Store but not on Windows Store. Nowadays, we have around 150,000 apps released on Microsoft’s market, though we can’t even compare this number with the apps that are available on Google: more than one million. Anyway, let’s hope that more and more devs will develop new apps for the Windows 8 system, so that in the future this gap will be erased.
