Have you heard the recent news about the iPhone 7 Plus? Some users have reported that their devices have bent and refuse to boot up, leaving them frustrated and without a working phone. This is a concerning issue, especially for those who rely on their iPhones for everyday use. In this article, we will discuss the possible causes of this problem and how you can prevent it from happening to your device.

First and foremost, it's important to understand why the iPhone 7 Plus is prone to bending. Unlike its predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 7 Plus has a unibody design made entirely of aluminum. This design choice was meant to make the device more lightweight and durable. However, it also makes the iPhone 7 Plus more susceptible to bending under pressure.

The bending issue usually occurs when the iPhone 7 Plus is in a user's pocket or bag, and pressure is applied to the device. This pressure can come from sitting down, bending over, or any other activity that puts pressure on the phone. If the pressure is significant enough, the aluminum body of the iPhone 7 Plus can bend, which can cause severe damage to the device's internal components.

Unfortunately, a bent iPhone 7 Plus can be difficult to repair, and in some cases, the device may not be fixable at all. If your iPhone 7 Plus has bent and refuses to boot up, you may need to take it to a professional repair shop or contact Apple support for assistance.

To prevent your iPhone 7 Plus from bending and refusing to boot up, there are a few things you can do. First, avoid putting your phone in your back pocket, as sitting on it can put significant pressure on the device. Instead, try to carry your phone in a bag or a front pocket where it can be protected from pressure.

Another option is to use a protective case for your iPhone 7 Plus. A case can add an extra layer of protection to your device, helping to prevent it from bending or being damaged in other ways. Plus, many cases come with other features like shock absorption and water resistance, which can be valuable in keeping your phone safe from other potential hazards.

In conclusion, if your iPhone 7 Plus has bent and refuses to boot up, you are not alone. This issue is a concern for many iPhone 7 Plus users, but there are steps you can take to prevent it from happening to your device. By avoiding putting your phone in your pocket and using a protective case, you can protect your phone from bending and ensure it stays in working order for longer.

 I bet my phone and won’t turn on ? What can I do is it something that can be repaired ? It’s a slight bent right were  the memory card eject hole is .

 Hi there,
Most likely the motherboard is also bent and the solder joints broke. This is a hard repair and I would advise going to a good micro solderer to check this and see what the problem may be.
