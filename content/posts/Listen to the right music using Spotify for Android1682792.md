If you love music and you have an Android device, then you’re in luck! Spotify for Android is one of the best music streaming services out there, offering a huge selection of songs, playlists, and albums that can cater to all your music needs.

But finding that perfect playlist can be a daunting task. You might have a lot of songs that you like, but you don’t know how to organize them into playlists that will match your moods or activities. If you’re tired of scrolling through endless playlists and not finding what you’re looking for, then read on! This guide will show you how to unlock the secret to finding your perfect playlist on Spotify for Android.

Step 1: Set up your account and preferences

First things first, make sure you have a Spotify account and that you have downloaded the app on your Android device. If you don’t have an account, sign up for one using your Facebook account or your email address. Once you have logged in, Spotify will ask you to choose your favorite artists and genres. This will help the app create playlists that will match your musical preferences.

Step 2: Explore the Browse section

The Browse section on Spotify for Android is where you can find playlists that are curated according to different moods, genres, and activities. For example, if you’re feeling sad, you can go to the “Sad Songs” playlist, or if you’re working out, you can go to the “Workout” playlist. Browse through the different categories and see if any of them match your mood or activity.

Step 3: Use the search bar

If you’re looking for a specific song, artist, or playlist, you can use the search bar to find it. Simply type in the name of what you’re looking for, and the app will give you a list of options that you can choose from. You can also use the search bar to explore different genres or moods by typing in keywords like “jazz” or “happy.”

Step 4: Create your own playlists

If you can’t find a playlist that matches your mood or activity, then create your own! Simply click on the “+” sign located at the bottom right corner of the screen and select “New Playlist.” Give your playlist a name and start adding songs to it. You can add songs that you have saved, search for new songs, or even browse other people’s playlists and add songs from there.

Step 5: Collaborate with others

If you have friends who also use Spotify for Android, you can collaborate with them to create a playlist together. Simply select “Collaborative Playlist” when creating a new playlist, and invite your friends to join. They can add songs to the playlist, and you can all enjoy listening to it together.

In conclusion, Spotify for Android is a powerful music streaming service that can help you find your perfect playlist. With its wide selection of songs, playlists, and albums, you can easily find music to match your mood or activity. By exploring the Browse section, using the search bar, creating your own playlists, and collaborating with others, you can unlock the secret to finding your perfect playlist on Spotify for Android.

Music- the art invented in the pre-historic era, was one of the greatest inventions by mankind and it now has thousands of branches which are commonly called as genres. Developed a lot in all lyrics, musical instruments and voice, it is obvious in this existing world that if we are humans, we love music. Its only the point that some are music maniac, and some just love to listen occasionally. And upto this time, the technology, specially in case of Internet and Smartphones is developed so much that these have become almost the basic needs for must of us. All the perspectives being added in this topic is that if you are an Android smartphone user (most of us actually are, from the very first time Android was developed), Spotify for android can be a right choice for you to listen your favorite music anytime you want.
 

 
Similar to some extent to the Pandora internet radio, Spotify for android is an online music service that lets you play songs from a library of more than 15 million tracks, build playlists, and get recommendations from other members or from its own suggestion engine. But unlike that of Pandora internet radio, it is not an internet radio neither does it play the comedy audio for you (it will let you select your favorite radio though, by clicking at the radio icon, and it will play it for you). It is a pure music app, using which you can listen to your favorite music, but you have to be online. It will also let you download the music of your choice, but to do that you have to upgrade it to the ad-free premium version, paying US$9.99. That is pretty much expensive, but it will have so much features that you would not possibly regret paying that much for this. One of that is you will be able to play in any of your devices- whether it be your mobile, tablet or computer. However, there are pretty much features you’ll like in the free version on the app itself. You can skip the tracks, but there will be the limit of six skips per hour. You will get the Extreme mode too, in which you can play 320 kbps high quality of music, crisp and fine.
 
Overall, Spotify for android is a solid app for the music lover Android users, who just love to listen the music of their choice online. Still, in case you want to download any tracks of your choice and put them in your device’s storage, you can try the music maniac app for android.
