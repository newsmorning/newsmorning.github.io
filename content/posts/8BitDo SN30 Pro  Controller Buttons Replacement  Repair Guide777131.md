If you're an avid gamer, you know how important your controller is to your gaming experience. It's the tool that connects you to your favorite game and helps you achieve your goals. However, after extended use, the buttons on your controller can start to wear out, leading to a frustrating and less effective gaming experience.

If you're dealing with this issue, don't worry. 8Bitdo's Sn30 Pro Controller is the solution you've been looking for. By following these eight easy steps, you can fix your buttons and bring your gaming experience back to life.

**Step 1: Gather Your Tools**

First things first, gather your tools. You'll need a precision screwdriver, a spudger, and a Phillips screwdriver. These tools can be found at most electronics stores or online.

**Step 2: Remove the Screws**

Locate the two screws on the bottom of your Sn30 Pro Controller and use a precision screwdriver to remove them. This will allow you to take apart the controller.

**Step 3: Remove the Cover**

Once the screws are removed, use a spudger to pry open the cover. Be careful not to damage any of the internal components.

**Step 4: Remove the Buttons**

With the cover removed, you can now access the buttons. Gently pull them out of their holders and set them aside.

**Step 5: Clean the Buttons**

Using a soft cloth, clean the buttons by wiping away any dirt or debris that may have accumulated on them. This will help ensure they function properly.

**Step 6: Clean the Holders**

Take some compressed air and spray the holders where the buttons sit. This will remove any dust that may have settled in the areas.

**Step 7: Reassemble the Controller**

Now that the buttons and holders are clean, it's time to reassemble the controller. Place the buttons back in their holders, making sure they are secure.

**Step 8: Test your Controller**

Finally, it's time to test your newly-fixed controller. Turn it on and use it to play your favorite game. You should notice that the buttons now work much better than before.

Hi, it looks like the buttons have little notches that limit where they can go. I was really hoping to modify it so that my a button is green and my b is red would that work if I file down that little notch?

The buttons are all the same height, so feel free to file down. Those nubs are just part of assemble process.
 
But do leave the 2 longer stems on each side of the button, they stop it from rotating freely.
