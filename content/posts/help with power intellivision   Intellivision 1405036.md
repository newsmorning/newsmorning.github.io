 hi there
i need some help with the power circuit of intellivision #1.
anyone have the values of the resistors in the power circuit and the exit voltajes ??
thanks for all

 Hi,
Here’s an automatic download link to the service manual for your Intellivision (I think that this is for your model - apologies if it is not.)
On p.2-7 you’ll find a schematic showing the test points for the various supply voltages and their values.
On p.7-2 you’ll find a schematic of the power board showing the values of the components.
Hopefully this is of some help.
