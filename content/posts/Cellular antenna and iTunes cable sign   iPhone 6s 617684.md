Unbelievable Secret Trick to Boost Your iPhone 6S Signal & Charge Lightning Fast - Revealed!

If you are an iPhone 6S user, you may be experiencing signal and charging issues that can be frustrating at times. However, there is an unbelievable secret trick that can help you boost your iPhone 6S signal and charge lightning fast. In this article, we will reveal this little-known trick and help you enhance your iPhone 6S experience.

The Trick

The trick is to put your iPhone 6S on airplane mode while charging. This may sound too good to be true, but many users have reported a significant improvement in their phone's signal reception and charging speed after trying this method.

Airplane mode disables all the wireless connections of your iPhone, including cellular data, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. This means that your phone will not use up any battery while searching for a signal, and it will not lose charge while trying to connect to a weak signal.

When your iPhone 6S is in airplane mode, it charges faster because it is not using any of its resources to connect to the internet or any wireless devices. Also, when your phone is not constantly searching for a signal, its battery life is likely to last longer.

The Science

But why does this trick work? The answer lies in the way your iPhone 6S communicates with the cellular towers. When your phone is not in airplane mode, it is constantly sending and receiving signals to and from the nearest cellular tower. This requires a lot of battery power and can reduce your phone's charge time.

On the other hand, when you turn on airplane mode, your iPhone stops sending and receiving signals to and from the tower, and this prevents your phone from draining its battery with constant searching for a signal. This means that your phone can charge quicker and more efficiently.

Conclusion

In conclusion, there is an unbelievable secret trick that can help you boost your iPhone 6S signal and charge lightning fast. This trick is to put your phone in airplane mode while charging. By doing so, you prevent your phone from draining its battery by continuously searching for a signal. This trick is simple and effective, and you can try it yourself to see if it improves your phone's signal and charging speed.

## Chosen Solution
 The signal of the mobile vanished so I took it to a technician whir tried to replace different antennas but didn’t work when I received the Mobil the iTunes cable sign was appeared and still on that sign with out opening so I took it to another technician who tried to replace it but failed so he told me that the logic board need to be replaced (bearing in mind it didn’t fall or crashed) so what you advise me to do?

 The technician that first worked on the phone killed it. It should not be stuck on recovery mode just from changing antennas.
