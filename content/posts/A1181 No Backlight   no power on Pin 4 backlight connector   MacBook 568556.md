Is Your Macbook A1181 in the Dark? Find Out the Shocking Reason Behind Its No Backlight and Power Issue on Pin 4 of the Connector!

For many Macbook A1181 users, experiencing power issues and no backlight is a common problem that can be frustrating and leave them in the dark. However, there is a hidden cause behind this issue that may surprise many users.

This problem often arises due to a failure of the pin 4 connector on the logic board that connects to the backlight inverter board. The pin is responsible for providing the necessary voltage to power the backlight and ensure it operates correctly.

When the pin fails, the backlight stops working, leading to a darkened screen. In addition, it can result in power issues, as the power management unit (PMU) of the MacBook may not be able to manage the power supply effectively, leaving the laptop unable to boot or turn on correctly.

Many users are unaware of the issue and turn to replacing the MacBook's battery or the inverter board, only to find that this does not solve the problem. Ultimately, this will leave them in the dark, unable to use their MacBook.

So, what can be done? The solution lies in sending the MacBook to a professional to replace the failed pin on the logic board. While it may seem daunting to send away your MacBook, it is often the most effective method of resolving the issue and restoring full functionality to your laptop.

It is always essential to address any issues with your MacBook promptly, as neglecting them can result in further damage or problems down the line. It is always helpful to go for a periodic check-up or maintenance if you're experiencing frequent issues with your computer.

In conclusion, if you find yourself experiencing the no backlight and power issue in your MacBook A1181, don’t worry, and know that this common issue can be resolved. Don't spend your time and money on replacing the battery or inverter board; seek professional help to solve the problem at its root. With the assistance of an expert, you can have peace of mind knowing that your MacBook will work efficiently and last longer, giving you the best value for your investment.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a Macbook A1181 with the 820-2279-A Logic Board and 13" display that the backlight is not working.
I know the display works being when its on, you can see an image on the screen but its very dark to see.
I purchased a replacement inverter thinking that was the problem but still no backlight. My only issue is could it be that the replacement inverter I got is bad as well? I really don’t know how I can test if the inverter is exactly supplying voltage on the other end that the LCD plugs into? Being if I plug a volt meter into that end won’t it fry my volt meter?
I was able to finally figure out a way to test to see if the backlight was bad on the Macbook screen itself. After plugging  that into another spare laptop, it does light up. I did try plugging a spare screen monitor into the Macbook and it doesn't light up.
I tested the 4 wires coming from the backlight connector on the logic board and I do get the same reading from the board to the other end of the connector which confirms the backlight harness is good. However I saw a post with what voltage I am supposed to see from the Backlight connector.
pin1 (right side): 12V,
pin2 : ground,
pin3: 5V,
pin4 (left side): 3.3V.
While the laptop is running with a volt meter I do not get any voltage from Pin 4 which is supposed to be 3.3v? Is this the reason why I am not getting any backlight to my screen? Is there a resister or something causing this not to supply voltage to this pin causing the backlight not to work? Any tips on what I should check/replace would be greatly appreciated.

 Michael Dougherty, pin 4 is coming from the backlight power management. Check the AND gate U9053 as well as coil L9001. Ultimately, it does sound like a bad inverter, and you better not test it with a conventional multimeter due to the high AC voltage.. If you need to identify the components, post an image of your logic board with your question. Hope this helps, good luck.

 Hi,
1 pin 12.6V
2 pin 0 V
3 pin 5 V
4pin 3.3 V

Is correct?

My screen blink on start up and keep black, if i remove and input conector from motherboard to inverter , blink again and black screen .
I already changed inverter and flat, just not change inverter cable.
Some one could help me, i don’t have more any ideas
