# Are You Tired of Low Battery Notifications Not Working on Windows 10? This Simple Fix Will Blow Your Mind!

As technology advances, our dependence on electronic devices continues to grow. For most of us, our laptop or desktop computer is an integral part of our daily lives. Whether it's for work or leisure, we rely on these machines to get us through the day. However, nothing can be more frustrating than being in the middle of a task on our computer and suddenly, the battery dies. That's why low battery notifications are crucial, especially for those who are always on the go. 

But what if your Windows 10 low battery notifications are not working? It can be a big problem. You may be in a hurry, and you don't have time to wait for your laptop to shut down without warning. Fortunately, there is a simple fix that you can do to ensure that low battery notifications work properly on your Windows 10 computer.

## Why are low battery notifications not working on Windows 10?

There are several reasons why your low battery notifications are not working on your Windows 10 computer. Here are some of the most common culprits:

1. Battery saver is turned on - When Battery Saver is turned on, Windows limits the background activity of apps and services to save battery life. This can affect the performance of low battery notifications.

2. Notification settings are turned off - You may have accidentally turned off notification settings for your computer. This can cause low battery notifications to stop working.

3. Battery driver is outdated - The battery driver is responsible for controlling the power settings of your device. An outdated driver can cause issues with low battery notifications.

4. Battery is malfunctioning - In rare cases, the battery itself may be malfunctioning. This can cause unpredictable behavior, including low battery notifications not working.

## How to Fix Low Battery Notifications Not Working on Windows 10

If you are experiencing issues with low battery notifications on your Windows 10 computer, there is a simple fix that you can do:

Step 1: Click on the Start menu and go to Settings.

Step 2: Click on System.

Step 3: Click on Battery from the left-hand menu.

Step 4: Click on Battery saver settings.

Step 5: Turn off the Battery saver toggle.

Step 6: Restart your computer.

Step 7: Go back to the Battery settings and turn on the Low battery notification toggle.

Step 8: Make sure that the Battery level is set to the desired percentage. By default, it is set to 20%.

Step 9: Check if the low battery notification is working by disconnecting your laptop from the power source and waiting for the notification to pop up.

If this method does not work, try updating your battery driver or checking if your notification settings are turned on. If the battery itself is malfunctioning, you may need to replace it.

## Conclusion

Low battery notifications are crucial for those who are always on the go. It's essential to have a notification that alerts you when you need to plug in your device before it shuts down without warning. If you're tired of low battery notifications not working on your Windows 10 computer, try the simple fix outlined above. Hopefully, this method will solve your low battery notification issues, and you can go back to being productive with your laptop.

## Battery notification won’t work on PC [FIX]
 
### 1. Switch the Battery Notification on
 
- Press the Cortana button on the taskbar to open that app.
 - Enter Control Panel in Cortana’s search box.
 - Select to open the Control Panel in the snapshot directly below.
 - Click Power Options to open the tab shown directly below.
 - Click Change plan settings > Change advanced power settings to open the window below.
 - Double-click Battery to expand its settings.
 - Click the + beside the Low battery notification to expand the options below.
 - If the On battery and Plugged in options are off, select On from their drop-down menus.
 - Press the Apply button to confirm the new settings.
 - Click OK to close the window.

 
Windows includes a couple of low-battery notification settings. Switching those settings on, if they’re off, will probably restore the notification in Windows 10. This is how you can switch the low battery alert on.
 
- Battery notification won't work on PC [FIX]
 - 1. Switch the Battery Notification on
 - 2. Configure the Low Battery Level
 - 3. Configure the Critical Battery Action Settings
 - 4. Restore the Power Plan Settings to Default
 - 5. Replace Your Laptop's Battery
 - 6. Add an Alternative Battery Notification to Windows

 
### 2. Configure the Low Battery Level
 
- Open the Power Options window again (which includes the battery notification settings).
 - Click Battery > Low battery level, as in the snapshot below.
 - Select On battery and enter 25 in its text box.
 - Enter 25 in the Plugged in text box.
 - Press the Apply and OK buttons.

 
Check the battery level settings if the notification isn’t popping up. Those options adjust the percentage charge required for the notification to pop up. Raise the battery level percentages to about 25% if they’re below 10%.
 
### 3. Configure the Critical Battery Action Settings
 
You might also need to configure the critical battery action settings. Click Battery > Critical battery action to expand its options as in the snapshot directly below. 
 
Click On battery and select Shut down on its drop-down menu. Press the Apply button to apply the new settings.
 
### 4. Restore the Power Plan Settings to Default
 
Restoring the power plan settings to their default configurations can also resolve the battery notification issue. This resolution requires you to adjust all three power plan settings separately. 
 
You can restore the default settings by selecting Balanced, Power Saver, and High Performance on the drop-down menu at the top of the Power Options window. Press the Restore plan defaults button, and click the Yes option to confirm.
 
### 5. Replace Your Laptop’s Battery
 
If you have an older laptop or notebook, the low battery notification alert might not need fixing. Your laptop’s battery might have deteriorated considerably. If that is the case, the PC might go off with the battery at the 20-30 percent level when unplugged. 
 
Thus, the PC shuts down before its battery has dropped to the required percentage charge for the notification to pop up.
 
Some PC issues are hard to tackle, especially when it comes to corrupted repositories or missing Windows files. If you are having troubles fixing an error, your system may be partially broken. We recommend installing Restoro, a tool that will scan your machine and identify what the fault is.Click here to download and start repairing.

You can replace user-serviceable batteries yourself. Slide the latch at the bottom of the laptop to remove the battery. Those without a user-serviceable battery can request a replacement from the laptop’s manufacturer.
 
### 6. Add an Alternative Battery Notification to Windows
 
You don’t need to fix the Windows 10 battery notifications, as there are alternatives. A few third-party programs provide alternative battery level alerts and alarms, such as BatteryBar Pro and Battery Alarm.

You can also set up a script in Notepad, or other text editors, that opens a notification window when the charge has dropped below a specified percentage. This is how you can set up a new low-battery alert for Windows.
 
set oLocator = CreateObject("WbemScripting.SWbemLocator")
set oServices = oLocator.ConnectServer(".","root\wmi")
set oResults = oServices.ExecQuery("select * from batteryfullchargedcapacity")
 
for each oResult in oResults
    iFull = oResult.FullChargedCapacity
next
 
while (1)
    set oResults = oServices.ExecQuery("select * from batterystatus")
    for each oResult in oResults
        iRemaining = oResult.RemainingCapacity
        bCharging = oResult.Charging
    next
    iPercent = Round((iRemaining / iFull) * 100)
    
 
    if iRemaining and not bCharging and (iPercent < 20) Then msgbox "Battery is at " & iPercent & "%",vbInformation, "Battery monitor"
    wscript.sleep 300000 ' sleep for 5 minutes
wend
 
- Copy the script above using the Ctrl + C.
 - Open Notepad and paste the script by pressing the Ctrl + V hotkey.
 - Click File and select Save As in Notepad.
 - Select All Files from the Save as type drop-down menu.
 - Enter battery.vbs in the File name text box.
 - Select to save the file to the desktop.
 - Press the Save button.
 - Now the desktop will include a battery.vbs script on it. Right-click the script and select Open to run it.

 
The window alert below will open when your laptop’s battery drops below 20 percent. The notification also has an additional audio effect. 
 
You can adjust when the window opens by editing the iPercent < 20 value in the script. For example, the notification will pop up at 24 percent with the iPercent value at 25.
 
So, if you can’t fix the low battery notification in Windows, you can always replace it with something else. However, adjusting the battery settings in Windows will usually fix the notification.
