Is Your iPhone 6S Hiding a Secret Code with Lines From Center of Phone? Click to Find Out!

A strange rumor has been spreading around the internet that the iPhone 6S is hiding a secret code with lines that appear from the center of the phone's screen. It has been said that these lines form a pattern that indicates a special code or hidden feature of the device. But is this true or simply a hoax?

The answer is that there is no secret code hidden in the lines that appear on the iPhone 6S's screen. These lines are actually a hardware feature known as the "force touch sensor." This technology enables the device to detect pressure on the screen and respond accordingly.

The force touch sensor is located in the center of the iPhone 6S's screen, which is why some users may see lines appear from that point. These lines are not indicative of a hidden code or feature, but simply a byproduct of the technology that powers the device.

It is also important to note that this feature is not unique to the iPhone 6S. Many other devices, including the iPhone 7 and 8, also utilize force touch technology. So, while the lines may appear on the screen, they do not hold any kind of secret message or hidden code.

So the next time you see these lines appear on your iPhone 6S's screen, rest assured that there is no hidden code waiting to be uncovered. It's just a hardware feature that makes the device function properly. 

In conclusion, it is always important to fact-check before believing in rumors, especially those that circulate online. While it can be tempting to believe in mysterious and intriguing stories, it is important to verify their accuracy before spreading them to others. In this case, the notion of a secret code hidden on the iPhone 6S is nothing more than a baseless rumor.
