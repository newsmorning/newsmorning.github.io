## What is the Global Release Date of Lost Ark? (2022)

Note that it is currently not available to players in Belgium and the Netherlands due to the rules related to Loot boxes in these countries. There are very specific rules that games have to adhere to in these countries and if they don’t, they can be subjected to fines or bans on the sale of copies.
 
Apart from this, the other countries who have been able to access the beta version of this game are Russia and Japan.
 
### What is the Lost Ark Release Time?
 
The time of the worldwide release of Lost Ark is not yet known. But to give you an idea, this was the release time of the game when it came out in the west:
 
Americas:
 
- 9am PT
 - 10am MT
 - 11am CT
 - 12pm ET

 
Europe:
 
- 5pm GMT

 
### Lost Ark Download Size & Space Required
 
The space you need to download and install Lost Ark is 70 GB. It only needs around 57 GB for the actual game. But the extra amount adds up to the total disk space required.
 
### Is Lost Ark Fully Released?
 
At the time of writing this article on 7th May 2022, Lost Ark hasn’t been fully released worldwide yet. Only the countries in NA, EU (with a couple of exceptions including South Africa) as well as South Korea are able to play the full version of the game right now.
 
If you try to access Lost Ark in a country where it isn’t available yet, you will come across this message:
 
- An error was encountered while processing your request:
 - This item is currently unavailable in your region

 

 
While the use of VPN worked initially and many bypassed location restrictions with it, now the developers are enforcing a VPN ban in the game. The launch of the game on NA, EU servers was also riddled with server problems with players ending up waiting for hours in the long queues. Plus, many players were getting kicked out of games as well. As you might already know, Lost Ark is a game which requires you to really invest your hours into it. That’s because only after a lot of grinding, you can obtain some highly prized items. Once the game releases globally, it remains to be seen how the servers will handle the high demand of players.
 
Moreover, it is the #2 game in the list of top games by current player count on Steam. It is closely following CSGO and has beaten Rust, Elden Ring, PUBG and even GTA V and that’s a huge feat.
