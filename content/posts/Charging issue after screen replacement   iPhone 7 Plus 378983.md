Is Your iPhone 7 Plus Charging Like a Snail After a Screen Replacement? Here's What You Need to Know!

If you've recently replaced the screen on your iPhone 7 Plus and noticed that it's charging at a slower rate than before, you're not alone. Many iPhone owners have reported similar issues, and the cause often comes down to a simple fix. In this article, we'll explain why your iPhone 7 Plus may be charging slowly after a screen replacement and what you can do to fix it.

The Reason Your iPhone 7 Plus May be Charging Slowly

The charging port on your iPhone 7 Plus is connected to the logic board by a set of ribbons. When you replace the screen on your iPhone, you'll need to disconnect these ribbons and then reconnect them once the new screen is installed. If these ribbons aren't connected properly, it can cause charging issues.

The main problem arises when the ribbons are not properly aligned. If the ribbons are even slightly off, your iPhone 7 Plus may not charge properly, or it could charge much slower than before. This issue can also be a result of a damaged charging port or bad battery.

Here's What You Need to Do to Fix It

The first thing you need to do is to ensure that the ribbons are properly aligned. You can do this by disassembling the iPhone and then reconnecting the ribbons properly. If you're not confident in doing it, you can take the phone to an authorized repair center where a technician can perform the repairs.

If your iPhone 7 Plus is still charging slowly after reconnecting the ribbons, there may be something wrong with the charging port or the battery. You can take the phone to an authorized repair center, and they can diagnose the problem and repair if necessary. You can also check if the charging cable, power adapter, or outlet is faulty by using a different one, or you can clean the charging port or replace the lightning connector.

In Conclusion

In conclusion, if your iPhone 7 Plus is charging slowly after a screen replacement, there may be a problem with your charging port or battery. But in most cases, it's simply due to poorly connected ribbons, which can cause the iPhone to charge slower or not at all. If you're uncomfortable reassembling the phone after the screen replacement, take it to an authorized repair center where a technician can fix the issue for you. By following these steps, you can ensure that your iPhone 7 Plus is always charging properly and quickly.

## Chosen Solution
 I have just had my screen replaced looked fine but the phone won’t charge properly now does get some charge but not full. It connects to iTunes I have done a soft reboot and a software update to try and resolve any ideas on what it could be

 My first thought is you fried your charge port somehow, but if you have connected to iTunes and can actually attempt to charge your battery, then your charge port is fine. An unfortunate side effect of changing the screen is that sometimes it can affect your battery. Did you power down your phone before beginning the repair, and did you unplug the battery before disassembling the phone? If you didn’t, this can sometimes have a negative affect on the battery. I’ve seen them run completely down, to where the battery has to be completely recharged after a screen change and I’ve also seen where they just don’t have the same life they used to have after a screen change. You might attempt to have your battery changed. If you encounter the same problem, the issue could lie with the logic board. Hope that’s helpful.
