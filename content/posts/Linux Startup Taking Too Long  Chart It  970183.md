# Is Linux Startup Driving You Crazy? See How to Optimize it with Our Exclusive Chart!

If you're a Linux user, you're probably familiar with the frustration of waiting for your system to start up. Slow boot times can be frustrating, especially when you're in a rush to get work done or to start playing your favorite games.

Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem! In this article, we'll show you how to optimize your Linux startup using our exclusive chart. With these tips and tricks, you'll be able to speed up your computer's boot time and get back to what you love doing.

# What is Linux Startup?

Linux startup is the process your computer goes through when it first boots up. This includes loading the operating system, drivers, and other essential software. The time it takes for your system to complete this process can vary depending on several factors. These factors can include the speed and capacity of your hardware, the number of programs set to start with your system, and more.

# Why is Linux Startup So Slow?

Several reasons can cause slow Linux startup times. These include:

- A large number of programs set to start with the system
- Too many services running
- Outdated or malfunctioning drivers
- Performance issues with the hardware

# How to Optimize Linux Startup?

Optimizing your Linux startup involves several steps. Here's how you can do it:

## Step 1: Identify the Problem

The first step is to identify the cause of the slow startup time. This can be done by using our exclusive chart to monitor the startup process. By doing so, you'll be able to see which programs and services are slowing down your system.

## Step 2: Stop Unnecessary Programs and Services

Once you've identified the problems, you can disable any unnecessary programs and services that you don't need running on startup. Doing this will help reduce the number of processes your system has to run during startup, speeding up the process.

## Step 3: Update Drivers

Outdated or malfunctioning drivers can also cause slow startup times. Make sure that all of your device drivers are up to date to ensure optimal performance.

## Step 4: Be Mindful of Your Hardware

Finally, be mindful of your hardware's health. Make sure your computer is clean, and the fans are running correctly, making sure that excessive heat isn't causing slowdowns.

# Final Words

Linux is an excellent operating system, but slow startup times can be frustrating. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can optimize your Linux startup and get back to enjoying your computer in no time. Remember, don't forget to use our exclusive chart to help you monitor startup processes, identify bottlenecks, and eliminate them effectively. Happy tinkering!

Hardware keeps getting faster and faster, and most of us are running machines that would have been unthinkably speedy a decade ago, yet somehow it never seems to feel that way. As the hardware gets faster, the software seems to get bigger and slower and we always seem to end up with something that dances around the line of usability. Linux has been no exception to this, with each new advance in hardware bringing a matching increase in the complexity of the software. If your system takes too long to boot, the best way to fix it is to know what’s bringing you down. For that, there’s Bootchart. This little utility will show you exactly what’s launching when and how long it each step takes.

 
### Installation
 
Most major Linux distributions have Bootchart already available in their standard repositories. Ubuntu users, for example, could install through the Ubuntu Software Center or from the command line with:
 
If your distro does not have a package available, you can get one from the Bootchart download page.  
 
If you installed from source, you may need to manually add Bootchart to your system startup routine. If that’s the case, please see the documentation here.  
 
### Running Bootchart
 
If installed correctly, Bootchart does not need to be directly run by the user. Instead, it is loaded by the OS at boot time. Naturally, this means that you’ll have to reboot for Bootchart to do its thing. Reboot into whatever runlevel you wish Bootchart to monitor. If you don’t know what a runlevel is, just boot normally.  
 
Once the system is back up and running, you can take a look at your chart (/var/bootchart) to find the problem areas.  
 

 
It’s worth noting that a bar which runs the full width of the chart does not necessarily mean it’s slow. Often these are programs that are initiated during startup and continue to run once startup is complete, like udev or Xorg.  
 
To get an idea how much time each item spends actually drawing heavy resources, take a look at the bar closely and you’ll see different shades of color representing the different states of the program at that time.  
 
The blue sections represent time spent utilizing the CPU, the pink shows disk activity, and grey is time spent idle. If you’re looking for ways to prune your startup, look for items with a lot of blue or pink, as they’re eating up the most resources.  
 
### Removing Startup Items
 
This is where things can get tricky, as different Linux distributions sometimes handle startup in different ways. The “standard” method is known as SysV Init, and we’ve previously discussed startup modifications on Debian’s SysV style startup. This method will work on most Linux distributions.  
 
In short, you’ll probably find the list of startup programs in a location such as /etc/rc2.d. Details of the removal process can be found at the link above, however there is one point that should be emphasized. The files you see in your rcX.d  directory all follow a consistent naming scheme. Those starting with S are launched when that runlevel is reached, those starting with K are killed.  
 
This means that to prevent an item from launching, you do not need to edit or remove the file, just rename it so that the S is now a K. This will ensure that the application is not run, and you can leave the files completely intact in case you decide to change your mind later.  
 
### Conclusion
 
With a tool like Bootchart, you can trim your system down to only the things you need, reducing delay and resource usage in the process. With Bootchart and the Window Maker desktop, this author has been able to get a 1.2 GHz Debian system to boot in under 20 seconds, while actively using only 2% of system RAM. You can’t fix it if you don’t know it’s broken, and Bootchart makes that easy.
