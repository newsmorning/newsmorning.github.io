# Is Your Company's Mobile App Security at Risk? Discover 5 Must-Know Tips for Safe Usage!

As our world becomes increasingly reliant on technology, the use of mobile applications has become more prevalent than ever. These apps are used for everything from managing banking and documents to messaging and social media. However, with the numerous benefits of mobile apps, there comes a need for increased security measures. In today's highly connected world, businesses must ensure that their mobile app security is not at risk. In this article, we will discuss 5 must-know tips for safe usage.

## 1. Keep Up-to-Date With App Security Measures

To ensure that your business is using the most effective mobile app security measures, stay up-to-date with the latest advancements. As technology continues to evolve, mobile app security risks will become increasingly complex. Therefore, it is crucial to stay well-informed to protect your business.

## 2. Only Use Trusted Applications

Only use trusted mobile applications. Use a reputable app store to download applications, such as the Google Play Store for Android devices or the Apple App Store for iOS devices.  Additionally, before downloading any application, check the ratings and reviews to see what other users have to say about the app. Use discretion when downloading applications from unknown sources, as they may contain malware that can harm your device.

## 3. Utilize a Password Manager

Mobile devices are used for sensitive business transactions, such as accessing banking information or confidential documents. Utilizing a password manager is an effective method of keeping login credentials secure. This software stores login information for various accounts, and the user only needs to remember one password to access all the accounts. This enhances security as the user does not have to write passwords down, making it less likely for them to fall into the wrong hands.

## 4. Practice Smart Use of Mobile Devices

Businesses should encourage employees to practice smart use of mobile devices. This includes not sharing smartphones, tablets or laptops, and not leaving devices unattended. Promptly returning lost devices to their owners increases the chance of preventing data breaches.

## 5. Regularly Update Devices

Mobile devices should be updated regularly. This includes installing the latest features as they become available and the latest operating system updates. These updates often contain essential security enhancements that help to protect devices.

In conclusion, mobile app security has become an essential aspect of doing business. Businesses must ensure that their mobile app security is not at risk to protect their data, reputation, and customers. Implementing these 5 must-know tips for safe usage is an excellent start to maintaining effective mobile app security.

However, we cannot just lose hope and be vulnerable or available for the attackers. To mitigate this, one should consider the following mobile application security best practices: –
 
### 1. Trust Reputable Apps
 
There are studies that have revealed that unofficial third-party app stores are capable of circulating a majority of mobile malware. Thus, with Android devices, IT should prohibit side loading (installing non-Google Play apps). Here, the iOS users are also not safe, and thus, they are prohibited from jailbreaking their devices that allows users to install applications from non-trusted sources.
 
### 2. Read App Reviews And Requested Permissions Before Installing
 
Mobile OS requires applications to disclose requested permissions on a prior basis, and the users are required to grant permissions explicitly. Unfortunately, we ignore them and accept the button allow without reading them because they are lengthy enough. However, if one is cautious enough, this can serve as an opportunity to spot intrusive apps. You should remain beware of apps with few installs or poor reviews.

For this, you’ll have to do a lot of research and find out the one that suits your requirements the best. One that is designed accurately will be able to detect the applications that have malicious behavior and let you know about the same. But don’t forget to install a reputable one else you may fall into the trap of hackers.
 
### 4. Use A Mobile App Reputation Service
 
The mobile app reputation services like Webroot are gaining mass popularity. The reason behind this is that these programs rate various mobile applications based on factors namely how well an app is secured or the limit up to which an app can access or shares personal data. The IT administrators can leverage these for analysis of any mobile app and tell their team about the same. There are several google apps that are capable of doing this.
 
### 5. Test Enterprise Apps For Security Risk
 
It is recommended to be aware of homegrown vulnerabilities and other weak security coding practices. If your organization develops in-house mobile apps, you can consider contracting with an application security test vendor in order to enable the security of those apps. These security vendors have quite effective methods for identifying vulnerabilities through various types of testing.
 
One can never declare his/her work done when it comes to security. However, establishing these basic mobile application security controls will surely help in diminishing the risk of malicious applications that might pose a threat to your organizational network.
