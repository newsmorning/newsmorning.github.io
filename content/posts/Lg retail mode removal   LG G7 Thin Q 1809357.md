## Chosen Solution
 How would one remove retail mode on an lg g7? A quick reply would be appreciated.

 This website explains what the limitations of a retail mode phone are and how to minimize the annoyance of the built-in retail mode app.
#1)  They can NEVER be used to make phone calls and cannot use Data Plans and can only connect to WiFi networks.
#2)  The retail mode app uses up 52GB of the onboard storage.  Adding a large microUSB card is a good idea.
