Here are 5 Chrome tab tricks that will change the way you browse the web.\nPin Tabs Pin tabs are an easy way to keep important tabs open without taking up too much space on your screen. Simply right-click on a tab and select “Pin Tab” to shrink it down to the size of the site’s favicon. Pinned tabs open automatically every time you open Chrome and are perfect for keeping frequently used websites like email or social media always accessible.\nUse Tab Groups Tab groups are a relatively new feature in Chrome that allow you to organize your tabs in groups. To create a new group, right-click on a tab and select “Add Tab to New Group.” From there, you can name the group and assign a color to easily identify it. This is perfect for grouping tabs by task or project, making it easier to switch between them.\nJump to Tabs with Keyboard Shortcuts If you have a lot of tabs open, it can be frustrating to find the right one. Luckily, Chrome has many keyboard shortcuts to help you jump around. Pressing Ctrl + 1 to 9 will take you to the corresponding open tab. If you have more than 9 tabs open, use Ctrl + Tab to switch between tabs by order of most recently used.\nUse Tab Hibernation Chrome tabs can use a lot of memory, especially if there are many open at once. That’s where tab hibernation comes in. This feature suspends tabs you haven’t used in a while, freeing up memory and speeding up Chrome. To enable tab hibernation, type “chrome://flags/#tab-hibernation” into the address bar and toggle the option to “Enabled.”\nReopen Closed Tabs We’ve all accidentally closed a tab we meant to keep open. Luckily, Chrome makes it easy to reopen closed tabs. Simply right-click on an open tab and select “Reopen Closed Tab” or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + T to bring back the last closed tab.\nIn conclusion, these 5 Chrome tab tricks will help you get ahead of the game and become a more efficient browser.
