# You've Been Using Screwdrivers Wrong Your Whole Life - How to Use Them on Your iPhone X!

Have you ever tried to open up your iPhone to replace a battery or fix a broken screen? Did you struggle with using the screwdriver? If you've been using screwdrivers your whole life, you might think you know everything there is to know about them. However, when it comes to using a screwdriver on your iPhone X, there are a few things you might be doing wrong.

First off, let's talk about the types of screwdrivers you're most likely to use on an iPhone X. These are the Pentalobe and Phillips screwdrivers. Pentalobe screws are the ones that look like star-shaped holes, while Phillips screws have cross-shaped holes.

One mistake people commonly make is using the wrong size screwdriver. If the screwdriver is too small, it might not fit properly into the screw head, and you could end up stripping the screw. If the screwdriver is too large, you might damage the surrounding area or the screw itself.

Another mistake people make is not applying enough pressure when turning the screwdriver. You might think that you need to be gentle to avoid damaging the phone or screw, but in reality, you need to be firm and apply enough pressure to get the screw to turn. However, it's important not to over-tighten the screw, as you could then strip it.

It's also essential to hold the screwdriver correctly. You should grip the handle firmly, and keep your wrist and elbow stationary while rotating the screwdriver with your fingers.

Finally, make sure you have the right tools. Using a regular screwdriver instead of a specialized Pentalobe or Phillips screwdriver could cause serious damage to your phone. Don't try to improvise with a makeshift tool either. It might seem like a good idea at the time, but it could end up causing irreversible damage.

Using a screwdriver on your iPhone X might seem daunting at first, but by following these tips, you can feel confident in your ability to make repairs. Remember to use the correct size and type of screwdriver, apply enough pressure, hold the screwdriver correctly, and use the right tools. With these in mind, you'll be able to repair your iPhone X like a pro!

## Chosen Solution
 Can anyone explain to a newbie where you buy such a large number of screwdrivers????  For example, if you look at the guide on this site to change the iphone x screen you need  9 Y000 screwdrivers

 No you only need 1 y tip screwdriver but there are 9 y tip screws, 1 Phillips,  and 2 pentalobe screws. If you buy the screen kit from ifixit it should come with all of the tools you will need to replace the screen.

Make sure that you mark wear each screw goes. There are different lengths of screws and if you put in the wrong spot it can damage the motherboard and be very expensive to repair. Some people draw the phone housing on a piece of paper and mark the spots where the screws go and put the screws on that spot.  Be careful because it's easy to knock the screws off of the paper. You can also get some 2 sided tape for phone repair and tape to the paper and and put the screw on the tape so they don't get lost. You can also buy a magnet board that has the diagram of the phone housing and the screen and has a spot to put the screws there so you don't lose them. I put a picture of the item
