# Is Your High-End PC Struggling with Lost Ark's FPS? Learn How to Fix it in 5 Easy Steps!

Lost Ark, the MMORPG game developed by Smilegate is a visually stunning, immersive game that offers players an exciting gaming experience. However, for players with high-end PCs, it can be frustrating when they find their PC is struggling to keep up with Lost Ark's FPS. If you're experiencing the same issue, don't worry, we've got you covered. In this article, we'll provide you with five easy steps to fix your PC's FPS so you can enjoy your gaming experience.

## Step 1: Update Your Graphics Drivers

Updating your graphics drivers is important because it ensures that your PC is using the latest technology to run the game. Graphics card manufacturers, such as Nvidia or AMD, release new drivers regularly that optimize the performance of the card for the latest games. If your graphics drivers are outdated, your PC is unlikely to run the game smoothly. Therefore, updating your graphics drivers is the first step in optimizing your PC's FPS.

## Step 2: Adjust the In-Game Settings

Lost Ark has various in-game settings that you can adjust to optimize its performance on your PC. Go to the game settings and adjust the following: 

- Graphics Settings: Set the graphics settings to low or medium to reduce the load on your PC. 

- Resolution: Lowering the resolution can significantly improve your PC's performance.

- Vsync: Disable Vsync as it can limit your FPS.

- Draw Distance: Reducing the draw distance can help reduce the load on your PC.

## Step 3: Make Adjustments in the Control Panel

Making adjustments in the control panel will also help improve your PC's performance. 

- Power Options: Set your PC to High Performance mode to ensure maximum performance while playing Lost Ark.

- Processor Settings: In the Control Panel, go to the Processor Settings and set the priority to High.

- Disable Background Programs: Disable any applications running in the background to free up your PC's resources.

## Step 4: Optimize Your PC for Gaming

Optimizing your PC for gaming can make a significant difference in your FPS. 

- Close Unnecessary Applications: Close any applications running in the background that are not required for gaming.

- Defragment Your Hard Drive: Defragmenting your hard drive can improve the performance of your PC.

## Step 5: Upgrade Your Hardware

If none of the above steps work, it may be time to upgrade your hardware. Upgrading your graphics card or RAM can significantly improve your PC's performance. Ensure that you consider your budget before upgrading your hardware.

In conclusion, if your high-end PC is struggling with Lost Ark's FPS, follow these five easy steps to optimize your PC's performance. Updating your graphics drivers, adjusting in-game settings, making adjustments in the control panel, optimizing your PC for gaming, and upgrading your hardware are all effective ways to improve your PC's FPS. Now, enjoy playing Lost Ark without any FPS struggles!

If you’re playing a game on a high-end PC, you expect a smooth, responsive experience. But if your FPS is low or just plain poor in Lost Ark, it can ruin the entire experience. And with higher-end systems costing more than ever before, low FPS isn’t something anyone wants to have to live with.
 
## Even high-end PCs experience low FPS
 
- Lost Ark is not a simple game when it comes to performance and optimization.

FPS measures the speed of your computer’s graphics card. FPS counter software can also help you keep track of the strain in your game. The higher the FPS, the smoother your game will look and feel. 
 
High-end PCs are designed to run games smoothly. The problem is that if you have a high-end PC, but you’re not getting the performance you thought you would, there may be some settings you can change to improve things.
 
But what causes low FPS in the first place? There are many factors that determine how well your system can run a game and most of them are completely out of your control. However, there are ways for you to improve your frame rate and make sure that it stays at an acceptable level.
 
## Why is my FPS so low on a high-end PC?
 
So, you’ve got the best graphics card money can buy, a top-end processor, and a high-end monitor. But for some reason, you’re still getting low frame rates in your favorite games. Here is why:
 
- System requirements – The first thing to check is the minimum and recommended system requirements for the game. These can be found on the game’s Steam page or in its store listing. If your PC isn’t meeting these requirements, it’s not going to run well even if it is a high-end PC.
 - Outdated OS – Using an outdated operating system can cause decreased performance because there are fewer resources available and the OS is not optimized for your hardware.
 - Hardware failure – One of the biggest reasons for low FPS is hardware failure. If your graphics card or CPU has been overheated for too long, it’s possible that they’re damaged beyond repair and need replacing as soon as possible.
 - Outdated drivers – Your drivers might be outdated or corrupted in some way; this could cause problems with your hardware not working properly or not being able to work with certain programs/games properly.

 
Sometimes, Lost Ark just can’t connect to the server so you can decide to wait it out or attempt to resolve the issue.

### How do I maximize my FPS in Lost Ark? 
 
Lag and frame drops are caused by two things: CPU usage and GPU usage. If either one of these things goes over 90%, then you will start to experience a lag in your game or even worse, complete freezes while playing.
 
Big-time gaming can be done without crashes, lags or freezes by keeping all drivers up to date and error-free. Manual checks are hard to perform, that’s why we recommend using an automate assistant that will scan for fresh driver versions daily. Here is how to use it:
 
- Download and install DriverFix.
 - Launch the software.
 - Wait for the newly installed app to detect all your PC’s faulty drivers.
 - You will be presented with a list of all the drivers that have issues, and you can choose the ones that you want to fix.
 - Wait for the driver download and fixing process to complete.
 - Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

 
Disclaimer: this program needs to be upgraded from the free version in order to perform some specific actions.
 
### DriverFix
 
 Do not let a bad driver interfere with your games and installed software. Use DriverFix today and run them without a single issue.

 
Nevertheless, you can still get the most out of your game with a few tricks. Here are some:
 
- Make sure your PC has enough RAM installed.
 - Set your graphics settings to the lowest possible.
 - Make sure you have the latest graphics card drivers installed.

 
#### What can I do if Lost Ark FPS capped?
 
Lost Ark caps its FPS at 60, which is pretty standard for most games these days. That said, if you have a powerful PC with a high refresh rate monitor, you may want to get rid of this cap so that you can enjoy the game at its true frame rate.
 
To remove the FPS cap in Lost Ark and allow your PC to operate at its full potential, follow the steps below:
 
- Launch the game and go to Settings.
 - Navigate to Video, set the Screen to Full Screen, and press OK.
