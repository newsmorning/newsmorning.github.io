## How to Disassemble Your Controller

To disassemble your 8Bitdo Sn30 Pro Controller, you need to follow these steps:

1. Turn off your controller and disconnect it from any device or cable.
2. Gently pry up the back cover of the controller using a flathead screwdriver or prying tool. Start from the bottom edge and work your way up and around the sides.
3. Unscrew the four screws holding the back cover to the front cover using a Phillips screwdriver.
4. Carefully lift up the back cover and set it aside. Beware of the two shoulder buttons that might fall out of their slots.
5. Locate the battery compartment and remove the battery by pulling up its connector tab gently.
6. Remove the three screws holding the circuit board to the front cover.
7. Lift up the circuit board and disconnect its ribbon cable from the front cover connector. Be careful not to damage the cable or the connector.
8. Set aside the circuit board, buttons, and rubber pads in a safe and organized way.

Now that you have disassembled your controller, you can inspect its components and identify any issues that need repairing or replacing. Here are some common problems and their solutions:

- Sticky or unresponsive buttons: Clean the contacts and the rubber pads with a soft cloth or alcohol. Check for any dirt, debris, or corrosion that might affect the electrical connection. If cleaning does not work, consider replacing the affected button or switch.
- Loose or drifting sticks: Check the joystick module for any loose or damaged components, such as the potentiometers or the actuator. Make sure the module is properly mounted and secured to the circuit board. If necessary, replace the joystick module with a new one.
- Broken or cracked parts: Inspect the front and back covers for any signs of wear, tear or breakage. Check the shoulder buttons for their springiness and responsiveness. If necessary, order replacement parts from the manufacturer, or use third-party parts that are compatible with your controller.
- Firmware or connectivity issues: Update your controller's firmware to the latest version by downloading it from the official website of the manufacturer. Make sure your device is compatible with your controller and that the drivers are installed properly. If necessary, reset your controller's settings or recalibrate its inputs.

## How to Reassemble Your Controller

It was an okey guide but the description of how to open the clips after unscrewing was very vague and I had no clue there these clips where and when open I notice three clips. One in between the joysticks and two underneath  L & R buttons. Also I needed a flat screwdriver to open them up.
