You Won't Believe What's Happening to the Home Button on Nabi 2!

The Nabi 2 tablet has been a popular option for parents looking for a device that combines education and entertainment for their children. But recently, users have reported issues with the home button on the Nabi 2.

At first, users were having trouble with the home button not responding. Some found that pressing it repeatedly was the only way to exit an app or return to the home screen. Others found that the button would work fine for a while, but then stop responding altogether.

However, the problem seems to have evolved. Some users are now reporting that the home button on their Nabi 2 is not only unresponsive, but it is also getting stuck. They say that pressing the button down creates a clicking sound, but the button does not pop back up. This leaves the tablet stuck on whatever screen or app it was on, making it impossible to navigate back to the home screen.

What's causing this issue? Some speculate that it may be a result of wear and tear on the button after prolonged use, while others suggest that it may be a manufacturing defect. Regardless of the cause, the effects are frustrating for Nabi 2 users.

So, what can be done about the home button issue? There is no definitive solution, but some users have reported success with resetting the tablet or cleaning the button with a small brush. Others have resorted to ordering replacement parts online to fix the issue.

If you are experiencing problems with the home button on your Nabi 2 tablet, don't hesitate to reach out to the manufacturer. They may be able to provide guidance or offer a solution to the problem. Additionally, joining Nabi 2 forums or social media groups may lead you to a community with similar issues and potentially, solutions.

In conclusion, the problems with the home button on the Nabi 2 tablet are frustrating for users. We hope that the manufacturer will address this issue, and that these problems will be resolved soon for the benefit of all Nabi 2 owners.

## Chosen Solution
 When i tap on home it wont go there.

 If the home app is not working try to do a hard reset by holding the power button and the home button. Or go to the settings then general and then reset. If the home button its self is not working you may have to replace it or bing it to a repair storage.
