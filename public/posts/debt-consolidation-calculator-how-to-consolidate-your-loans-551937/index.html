Here the debt consolidation calculator will make all such calculations easy.\nHow to Calculate using the Debt Consolidation Loan Calculator? Step #1 – First, find out the present value of the outstanding balances on the multiple loans\nDebt Consolidation Calculator [∑PV x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]\n∑PV is the sum of present value of outstanding Balances R is the new rate of interest N is the remaining number of payments Step #2 – Next would be to find out the new installment amount based on existing outstanding balances with a lower rate of interest using the below formula\nStep #3 – Now calculate the period within which the debt can be paid off\nWherein,\nPV is the present value of Outstanding Balance∑PV is the sum of the present value of outstanding balancesL is the existing PaymentL’ is the new Paymenti is the old rate of interestR is the new rate of interestn is the frequency of paymentsN is the remaining number of paymentsnPVA is the number of periodical payments Debt Consolidation Loan Calculator Examples Example #1 Suppose that Mr. X has two debts outstanding: one is for $45,987, and another one is for $15,788. The interest rate was quite high, so Mr. X decided to convert them into a consolidated loan for four years with a rate of interest of 9.75%.\nBased on the given information, you are required to calculate the new installment amount of the consolidated debt\nSolution:\nWe have two loans outstanding one is for $45,987, and the second one is $15,788, and the total outstanding debt would be $61,775\nThe rate of interest would be 9.75%/12, which is 0.81%\n= [61,775 x 0.81% x (1+0.81%)^48] / [(1+0.81%)^48-1]\n= $1,559.37\nHence, if Mr. X wishes to consolidate the loan, he must pay $1,559.37 monthly for four years.\nExample #2 Sunita Williams has taken two loans and the details of which are given below:\nSunita has recently received an offer from the Bank to merge the debt into one, with the duration being the equivalent of the longest outstanding tenure. The current monthly installment she is paying is $619.88 and $913.07, respectively. The rate of interest offered is 9%.\nBased on the given information, you must calculate the new installment amount of the consolidated loan and the tenure within which the debt can pay off fully.\nWe need to calculate the present valuePresent ValuePresent Value (PV) is the today’s value of money you expect to get from future income. It is computed as the sum of future investment returns discounted at a certain rate of return expectation.read more of the current outstanding Debt balance, which can be calculated per the below formula:\nStudent Loan Rate of interest applicable on monthly basis = 11/12 = 0.92%\nThe remaining period is seven years, which is 84 months.\n= $619.88*[1-(1+0.92%)-84/0.92%]\n= $36,202.50\nAuto Loan Rate of interest applicable on monthly basis = 10/12 = 0.83%\nThe remaining period is five years which is 60 months.\n= $913.07 x [1 – (1+0.83%)-60 / 0.83%]\n= $42,973.75\nConsolidated outstanding loan = $36,202.50 + $42,973.75\n= $79,176.25\nWe will now calculate the new installment amount using the formula below, taking a new interest rate, which is (9%/12) 0.75%, tenure of the longest loan outstanding is 84 months. = [79,176.25 x 0.75% x (1+0.75%)^84] / [(1+0.75%)^84-1]\n= $1,532.94\nTenure within which to pay off a consolidated loan Now, we shall calculate within what period will the consolidated loan be cleared off = In [{(1-79,176.25*(0.75%)/1,532.94}-1]/In(1+0.75%)\n= 65.58 months\nHence, the debt can be cleared off within five and six months with a new installment.\nAdvantages The main benefit is that the loan will be paid off sooner, which shall boost the borrower’s credit score.Once this debt consolidation is done, the collection agenciesCollection AgenciesA collection agency refers to a firm engaged in the recovery of the default loans or dues from the borrowers on behalf of the lenders or creditors.

Disadvantages There could be a modest impact on credit score due to the renegotiation of multiple loans into one consolidation loan, as that would reflect the inability to repay the loans.Due to liquidity crunches, the debt is consolidated, which can be issued at a higher interest rate than the individual one. And hence the loan repaid at lower interest would shift to the higher-paying interest rate. Important Points to be noted The following points need to be noted while consolidating the debt\nThe borrower should have multiple debts outstandingEither Bank would have offered to the borrower to consolidate the loans at a lower rate due to his good credit score, or the borrower would wish to consolidate if he defaults on multiple loans.There could be terms such as minimum outstanding loan amount should be $100,000 in certain cases to consolidate or minimum tenure remaining should be three or more years.
