Title: The Unthinkable Came True: My Mac Mini PowerPC is Stranded with a Stuck CD Inside and I'm Stuck with a Tech Dilemma

Intro:
It's easy to get attached to things, especially gadgets that we hold dear to our hearts. In my case, it's my Mac Mini PowerPC. It's been with me through thick and thin, and I've poured my heart and soul into it. However, a moment of carelessness on my part stuck its CD inside, leaving me in a tech dilemma.

Body:
To understand how big of a deal this is, you need to know what a Mac Mini PowerPC is. In short, it's one of the older models of Mac computers that run on a PowerPC processor instead of an Intel one. It was released in 2005, and while it may not be as snappy as the newer models, it holds a special place in the hearts of many Mac enthusiasts, myself included.

So, imagine my horror when I pressed the eject button and the CD did not come out. I tried restarting the computer, shutting it down, and restarting it again, but to no avail. It seemed that I was stuck with this CD inside for the remainder of my computer's lifespan.

In a fit of desperation, I turned to the internet for help. That's when I discovered that I wasn't alone in my struggle. There were countless forums and articles detailing similar situations and different ways to try and get the CD out. I tried all the suggested methods - holding down the mouse button while restarting, using a cardboard strip, and even fiddling with the gears inside the CD drive. However, none of them worked.

As a last resort, I considered taking apart the entire computer myself to get to the CD. But then I realized that I was dealing with a PowerPC model, and the CD drive was not as easily accessible as the newer models. The thought of breaking my precious Mac Mini was too much to bear, so I abandoned that idea.

Conclusion:
So, here I am, stuck with a CD inside my Mac Mini PowerPC. It may not seem like a big deal to some, but to me, it's a gut-wrenching situation. I'm left with only two options - either live with it or take it to a professional tech repair service, which might cost me more than I'm willing to pay.

The lesson I learned from this experience is to take care of your gadgets and be mindful of the little things. It's easy to take them for granted until one day, they're no longer functioning as they should. As for my Mac Mini, I'll still cherish it, CD and all, and hopefully, one day, I'll find a way to get that thing out.

## Chosen Solution
 I have a mac mini as listed A1103 it belongs to my girl theres a cd inside the unit and it doesnt come out and seems to be causing some kind of error because the unit doesnt post. Is the cd inside causing the problem, in any case this is the issue how do i take the cd out?
Or do i have to replace the optical drive?
Thanks in advance.

 Restart holding down the mouse button and it should eject.
Also try:
Open the Terminal in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder and run:
drutil eject

 If your CD is stuck and none of the other methods work, you might eventually try pulling out your optical drive and doing this: Optical Drive Disc Removal Technique

 You could also try the
 double sticky tape trick,
There's many reasons to fail POST however AFAIK a stuck CD is not one of them.
