## Auto-Move:

Tired of the constant hand fatigue that comes with manually moving your character around the map? Auto-move is here to save the day! To activate it, simply press the "U" key on your keyboard. This will let your character move on its own, following the path you've set out for it. With auto-move, you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the scenery, without having to worry about manually controlling your character's movements.

## Auto-Attack:

It's time to take your combat skills to the next level with auto-attack! By using this skill, your character will automatically attack any enemy that comes within range. This means that you can focus on other things, like dodging enemy attacks and using special abilities. To activate auto-attack, simply press the "Tab" key on your keyboard. This will let your character automatically attack nearby enemies until they're no longer in range.

## Auto-Fish:

Fishing is a great way to relax and earn some extra cash in Lost Ark, but it can be a time-consuming process if done manually. Auto-fish is here to help! To use this skill, simply press the "F" key while your fishing rod is equipped. This will let your character automatically cast the line, reel it in when a fish bites, and even discard any unwanted fish. With auto-fish, you can concentrate on other tasks while still enjoying the benefits of fishing.

## Auto-Sail:

Navigating the seas in Lost Ark can be treacherous, especially if you're not experienced with steering a ship. Auto-sail is a lifesaver in this regard. To use it, simply press the "Shift" key while your ship is sailing. This will let your character automatically steer the ship in the desired direction, while avoiding obstacles and enemies. With auto-sail, you can focus on other tasks, like checking your map and keeping an eye out for loot.

## Auto-Loot:

Looting is an essential part of the game, but it can also be tedious and time-consuming. Auto-loot is here to lend a hand! To use this skill, simply press the "Ctrl" key when you approach a lootable item. This will let your character automatically pick up the item, without having to manually click on it. With auto-loot, you can quickly collect all the items you need, without having to waste time clicking on each one individually.

## Conclusion:

By utilizing the above skills, you can unlock the ultimate Lost Ark experience. Auto-move, auto-attack, auto-fish, auto-sail, auto-loot, and more can all help you to improve your gameplay and focus on the more important aspects of the game.
