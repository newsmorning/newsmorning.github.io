Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When Liquid Spilled on My MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 - But the Corrosion Worries Were Solved!

Introduction:

Spilling liquid on your MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 can be a terrifying experience, especially if you rely on it for work or other important tasks. That was the case for me, and it happened one day when I was typing away on my laptop, and I accidentally spilled coffee all over the keys. Panic set in as I watched the liquid seep into the keyboard and thought about the damage it could cause. However, after some quick thinking and research, I found that there were ways to solve the corrosion worries and get my MacBook back to its usual state.

Body:

The first thing I did after spilling liquid on my MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 was to turn it off immediately. It may seem simple, but shutting down your device when it comes into contact with liquid is a critical step that can prevent further damage. Once I had turned it off, I flipped my laptop over and drained as much coffee out of it as possible. I then used a microfiber cloth to wipe the excess liquid off the keys and the laptop's surface.

After ensuring that there was no more liquid on my MacBook, I left it upside down to let it dry properly. Leaving a laptop in this position helps to drain any remaining liquid and prevent it from seeping into the machine's internal parts. I left it to dry for a few hours, but in some cases, it may take longer for the laptop to dry.

The next step was to clean the keyboard and ensure there was no corrosion. Corrosion occurs when liquid seeps into the keyboard and reacts with the metal contacts. This can lead to malfunctioning keys or a dead keyboard. To avoid this, I used isopropyl alcohol and Q-tips to clean the keys and the keyboard's metal contacts.

After using the isopropyl alcohol, I left the laptop for about 24 hours to ensure that it was properly dry before turning it back on. When I finally turned it on, I was happy to find that there was no keyboard damage or malfunctioning keys.

Conclusion:

Spilling liquid on your MacBook Pro 13 Function Keys 2017 can be a scary experience, but there are ways to solve the corrosion worries and get your laptop back to normal if you act quickly. It is essential to turn off the laptop immediately, flip it over, and drain out as much liquid as possible. Then, let it dry correctly, use isopropyl alcohol to clean the keyboard, and let it dry again before turning it back on. If your laptop has any lasting damage, it may be necessary to take it to a professional technician for further assistance. Remember to be careful and avoid spilling liquid on your laptop in the future.

## Chosen Solution
 So yesterday at around 10 pm I spilled milk on my computer. I don’t think it was a lot, but I know some did get in the keys. I immediately wiped the milk on the surface and also tried pushing the keys to get the excess milk out, which did work. Then, I did something really stupid. I went on YouTube ON THE COMPUTER and searched for what I should do. I know that was probably one of the dumbest things I could have done, but I didn’t know any better. From what I could see, nothing was wrong with the computer, it was working fine. After about 10 minutes, I turned it off ( I didn’t shut it down) and put it in a tent position. Luckily it wasn’t plugged in or anything. This morning I went to look at it, and when I tried checking if there was any liquid that came out, I accidentally turned it back on! BTW there was no liquid that came out. I immediately turned it off and it’s back in the tent position. Is my computer salvageable? It seems to be working fine. I’m 13 and this thing is my baby I use it for literally everything. Please help!!
Update (03/04/2021)
UPDATE: So I’m coming back on here to update the problem. It’s been 3 days and I have completely fixed my computer problem! As said before, my computer was working fine even after the spill, but I was mostly worried about corrosion over time. I knew my only options at that point were to go to a computer technician to help me clean the spill, or buy a screwdriver to open the computer up myself. Since I am only 13, I would need to tell my mom about this in order to go to a computer technician, and I really REALLY didn’t want to do that. This computer was a gift from her and I swore to keep it in  good condition. I know it was so dumb of me to have liquids near my computer, and I definitely learned my lesson the hard way. I usually have a keyboard cover, and I almost ALWAYS have it on my computer, but it was just my luck that a would spill something when my computer was naked. So, after binging YouTube videos on how to clean a water damaged MacBook, I finally gathered enough courage to buy a screwdriver and clean it myself. Again, I am a 13 year old with absolutely NO knowledge about computers, but with these videos:

I was able to clean my computer! I must admit, it was very intimidating when I opened it up and saw all the tiny parts, but you can just do one part every day to make it easier.  When you Google what to do if something like this happens, many people say to just turn your computer over and let it dry. But often times, that is not enough. You need to clean the insides because the impurities can cause corrosion after a few weeks. Your computer may not be my exact model, but there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube.  If you are in the same situation that I was in, I would suggest just doing it yourself.But wether or not you are going to bring it to a computer technician or not, the most important thing to do is act fast. Don’t let your computer sit there for weeks. It will corrode more and damage some internal parts, which you will then have to replace. I hope this helped anyone! I know two days ago if I saw something like this I would have been so happy and relieved.

 You maybe lucky! But, it will come back to haunt you ;-{
The problem isn’t the liquid as it does sound like your system is dry now. The problem is Milk is more than H2O it has acids, fats and sugars all of which can cause corrosion!
Sadly, getting the keyboard out to replace is not something one can do as its really riveted in well into the uppercase, so you would need to get the uppercase replaced which is not cheap!
