Unlock the Hidden Secrets of Safari on your MacBook Air 13: Discover Power Tips and Tricks for the Early 2017 Model!

Safari is a web browser that comes pre-installed on MacBook Air 13. It is one of the most widely used browsers worldwide and is known for its exceptional speed and security features. Many users are not aware of the hidden features that come with Safari. In this article, we will uncover some of the power tips and tricks that you can use to optimize your Safari browsing experience on your MacBook Air 13.

Tip 1 - Customize Your Homepage
The first thing you see when launching Safari is the homepage. By default, it is set to the Apple website. However, you can customize this to your preference. To do this, click on Safari > Preferences > General. Under the "Homepage" section, enter the URL of the website you want to use as your homepage.

Tip 2 - Use Split View
When working on your MacBook Air 13, you can split your screen to work on two different applications. This is a useful feature when doing research or working on multiple projects. To use Split View, open Safari and click and hold down the full-screen button located in the upper left corner of the screen. This will allow you to choose which application you want to open alongside Safari.

Tip 3 - Enable Reader View
Have you ever come across an article with distracting ads and pop-ups? With Safari's Reader View, you can remove these distractions and focus on reading the content. To activate Reader View, click on the "Reader" icon that appears in the left side of the address bar when you visit a web page with an article.

Tip 4 - Use Keyboard Shortcuts
Safari has several keyboard shortcuts that can help you navigate the browser quickly. Here are some of the most commonly used:

- Command + T: Opens a new tab
- Command + W: Closes the current tab
- Command + R: Reloads the current page
- Command + F: Opens the Find bar to search for text on the page
- Command + Shift + T: Reopens the last closed tab

Tip 5 - Customize Your Toolbar
Safari's toolbar contains several icons that allow you to access different functions quickly. However, you may not use all of them, and some of them may be hidden. To customize your toolbar, right-click on the toolbar and select "Customize Toolbar." You can then drag and drop icons to add or remove them from the toolbar.

Tip 6 - Use Private Browsing
If you value your privacy when browsing the internet, you can use private browsing in Safari. This feature ensures that your browsing history, cookies, and other data are not saved on your device. To start Private Browsing, click on File > New Private Window or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Command + N.

Tip 7 - Manage Your Downloads
When downloading files in Safari, you can easily manage them by clicking on the Downloads icon that appears in the toolbar. You can then see the progress of your downloads, the time remaining, and the location where the file is saved.

In conclusion, Safari is a robust browser that has many hidden features that can enhance your browsing experience on your MacBook Air 13. By using these tips and tricks, you can optimize your browser to suit your needs and browse the internet like a pro.

## Chosen Solution
 Having issues accessing Safari.  When accessing, the blue bar loads a quarter of the way, then stops.  I then get a timeout issue and an error message.  No WiFi issues.  Never had this issue before.  Not sure what to do next?

 While its not intuitive your systems storage maybe the issue. Make an effort to clean out old stuff you don’t need free up at least 1/4 of your drive. See if that helps. Aos reduce the number of Apps you have open concurrently.
It sounds like your system is running out of space for virtual RAM & caching.
If that doesn’t help you’ll need to wipe the drive and re-install your OS, Apps and any data, so you’ll want to make sure you’ve backed up.
