Title: SHOCKING REVELATION: Linksys E900 N300 Router's Default Password can COMPROMISE YOUR SECURITY!

Introduction: Internet connectivity has become a basic need in today's digital society. Almost everyone has an internet connection installed in their homes or offices. One of the essential components of an internet connection is a router, a device that connects multiple devices to a single internet connection. One of the most popular router models on the market is the Linksys E900 N300 router. However, recent studies have revealed some alarming information regarding its security.

The Problem: The Linksys E900 N300 router comes with a default password that users can change to secure their network. However, research has shown that many users never change the default password, leaving their network vulnerable to hackers. Hackers can easily gain access to the router's settings and all connected devices, compromising sensitive personal or company data.

The Consequences: If a hacker gains access to your router, they can collect your network's data and use it for malicious purposes. They can also compromise any connected devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, and infect them with viruses or malware. Personal information, including login credentials, financial data, and any other sensitive information transmitted through the network, can be intercepted and used fraudulently.

The Solution: Changing your router's default password is the first step in securing your network. It is recommended to create a strong, unique password that combines uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, you should keep your router's firmware updated to ensure that it is running the most secure software version. Finally, you can enable encryption protocols such as WPA2 to ensure that data transmitted over your network is encrypted and secure.

Conclusion: In conclusion, owning a router is important in today's digital world, but it is not enough to merely have one. You need to secure it. A router that is vulnerable can compromise not only your data but also the data of everyone who uses your network. By changing your default password, updating your firmware, and enabling encryption protocols, you can protect your network and ensure that your data remains safe. Take these steps today to secure your Linksys E900 N300 router, and stay one step ahead of hackers.



The default password for all Linksys E900 routers is admin. This password is case-sensitive, as with most passwords. Some routers don't require a username when logging on with the default credentials, but on the E900, it's admin, the same as the password. This router's default IP address is the same as most Linksys routers: 192.168.1.1.

 
##   Help! The E900 Default Password Doesn't Work!  
 

If the default username or password for your Linksys E900 router doesn't work, then it means they were changed after the router was set up. Changing the default information means it's easier to forget the new password!

 
The device model number is E900, but is often marketed as the Linksys N300 router. There's only one hardware version of this router, so all E900 routers use the same information. If this doesn't match your router's model number, see the Linksys Default Password List.
 

To restore the Linksys E900 router default username and password, reset the router to factory defaults:

 
- With the router plugged in and powered on, flip it over on its top so that you have access to the bottom.
 - With a paperclip or other small and sharp object, press and hold the Reset button (it's accessible through a tiny hole on the bottom of the router) for 5 to 10 seconds. During this time, the Ethernet ports on the back flash simultaneously.
 - Wait 30 seconds after resetting the Linksys E900 router to give the software time to reset.
 - Remove the power cable from the power port on the back of the router, wait 10 to 15 seconds, then plug the cable into the router.
 - Wait 30 seconds to give the router time to fully boot back up.
 - Make sure the network cables are still attached to the back, then turn it over to its regular position.
 - With the settings restored, use the http://192.168.1.1 default IP address and the admin username and password to log in to the router and access the configuration settings.
 - Change the router password and the username to increase the security of the router. We recommend storing the new password in a password manager or some other safe place so you don't forget it.

 
##   Help! I Can't Access My E900 Router!  
 

You have to know the IP address of the router before you can log in to it, but if the IP address was changed to something else, then using the default http://192.168.1.1 address won't work. To find the Linksys E900 IP address without resetting the router, you'll need to know the default gateway of a computer that's connected to the router.

 
Resetting is different from restarting. Resetting removes custom software settings (such as the password and Wi-Fi information) and returns the router to its factory default settings. Restarting a router simply shuts it down and powers it back up.
