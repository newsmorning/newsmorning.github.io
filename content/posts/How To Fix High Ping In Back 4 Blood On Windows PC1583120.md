Introduction

Back 4 Blood is a thrilling first-person shooter game that allows players to embark on epic zombie-hunting missions with their friends. However, many gamers have been experiencing high ping when playing the game on Windows PC, which can cause lag and ruin the gaming experience. In this article, we will discuss the ultimate fix for high ping in Back 4 Blood on Windows PC.

Step 1: Check Your Internet Connection

One of the most common causes of high ping in online games is a poor internet connection. To check if your internet connection is the problem, use a speed testing tool to measure your internet's download and upload speed. A download speed of at least 3Mbps and an upload speed of at least 1Mbps is recommended for online gaming. If your connection is slow, try rebooting your modem/router, or contact your internet service provider for assistance.

Step 2: Close Unnecessary Programs

Running other programs in the background can consume your computer's resources and cause high ping in Back 4 Blood. To close unnecessary programs, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to open the Task Manager and check the programs running under the Processes tab. Close any programs that you're not using or that are consuming too much CPU, memory or network resources.

Step 3: Configure Your Firewall

Sometimes, firewalls can block Back 4 Blood's connections and cause high ping. To configure your firewall, go to the Control Panel, then to System and Security, then to Windows Defender Firewall. Click on "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall," then click on "Change Settings," and find Back 4 Blood in the list. Make sure both the Public and Private checkboxes next to Back 4 Blood are enabled, then click OK.

Step 4: Update Your Graphics Card Drivers

Outdated graphics card drivers can cause performance issues and high ping in Back 4 Blood. To update your graphics card drivers, go to the manufacturer's website and find the latest driver version for your graphics card model. Download and install the driver, then restart your computer.

Step 5: Use a Gaming VPN

Sometimes, high ping can be caused by network congestion or routing issues. Using a gaming VPN can help reduce latency and improve your gaming experience. A gaming VPN like Outfox works by routing your game traffic through a network of dedicated gaming servers, which can help reduce your ping and improve your connection stability.

Conclusion

High ping can be a frustrating experience for Back 4 Blood players on Windows PC, but by following these steps, you can say goodbye to lag and enjoy a smooth and seamless gaming experience. Remember to check your internet connection, close unnecessary programs, configure your firewall, update your graphics card drivers, and consider using a gaming VPN. Have fun hunting down those zombies!

## How To Fix High Ping In Back 4 Blood On Windows Pc
 
### Method 1: Reboot Internet Connection
 
The first step to take in how to fix high ping is to reboot your internet connection and check if the Back 4 Blood game is working properly. This can be done by the following steps:
 
Step 1: Turn off your router/modem and disconnect the power cable.
 

 
Step 2: Next, shut down your computer.
 
Step 3: Wait for 60 seconds and then attach the power cable to your modem/ router and turn it on.

Step 5: Now try playing the back 4 blood game and check if you are still facing high ping issues.
 
Note: It is recommended to play games on an ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi for better results.
 
### Method 2: Close Unnecessary Programs
 
When other apps are dominating your bandwidth, you’re more likely to have lag spikes and a high ping in-game. Your connection will become quite slow if you have a lot of tabs open or movies loading in the background on your browser. You can disable the apps from operating in the background and consuming your bandwidth by doing the following:
 
Step 1: Right-click your taskbar and select Task Manager from the drop-down menu.
 
Step 2: Right-click your taskbar and select Task Manager from the drop-down menu. Look for processes that are hogging the network in the Processes tab. After you’ve selected it, click End Task.
 
Step 3: Check if the ping issues have been resolved, else if you’re still getting a high ping and the game is lagging, move on to the next step.
 
### Method 3: Flush DNS
 
The process of flushing DNS will clean your computer’s DNS cache. When you remove the DNS cache, your PC will have to get the address from the DNS server every time it needs to access a new website. If the lagging in Back 4 Blood is caused by faulty or corrupt DNS cache data, this may be the solution. This is how you do it:
 
Step 1: To open the Run box, press the Windows logo key and R on your keyboard.
 
Step 2: Press Shift and Enter at the same time while typing cmd. If you’re asked for permission, say yes.
 
Step 3: Copy and paste ipconfig /flushdns into the pop-up window. Then press the Enter key.
 
Step 4: Your DNS cache has been cleaned successfully. This is an important step in the process on how to stop high ping while playing Back 4 Blood.
 
### Method 4: Update Network Driver
 
Using a device driver updater application like Smart Driver Care is an easy solution for ensuring network driver updates on your system. This application can swiftly scan, locate, download, and install the most recent drivers, and it only takes four to five mouse clicks on the software interface before the automatic driver update procedure begins. The following are the steps of using Smart Driver Care:
 
Step 1: Download the application from the below link.
 
Step 2: To install the application, run the file you downloaded in Step 1.

Step 5: Click the Update Driver link next to the network driver, and the software will update the driver for you.
 
Step 6: Restart the computer to determine if the problem persists.
 
Smart Driver Care also backs up your drivers before updating them, allowing users to restore to a previous version if needed.
 
### The Final Word On How to Fix High Ping in Back 4 Blood on Windows PC?
 
Smart Driver Care is a fantastic program that allows you to update all of your system’s drivers. The manual method also ensures 100 percent success, but it would take a lot of time and work to manually update all of your old drivers. Instead, with a few mouse clicks, you can update all of your driver abnormalities using Smart Driver Care.
