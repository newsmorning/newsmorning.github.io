If you are a laptop user who relies on WiFi, then you know how frustrating it can be to deal with a faulty WiFi card. It can disrupt your workflow and online activities. Moreover, replacing a WiFi card can be an even more frustrating experience, especially when you do not have admin privileges on your laptop. This leaves you with the question of how to replace a WiFi card without the administrator password.

Recently, we faced a similar situation where we had to replace the WiFi card on an HP Pavilion laptop, but the admin password was unknown. We could have given up, but we decided to get creative and come up with a crazy hack to replace the WiFi card without the admin password.

First, we started by researching online and found out that the HP Pavilion laptop has a whitelist of allowed WiFi cards. This meant that we could not install any random WiFi card onto the laptop. However, we also discovered that the whitelist is stored within the laptop's BIOS, which can be accessed even if you do not have admin privileges.

With this knowledge, we proceeded to find a compatible WiFi card that was on the whitelist. We were lucky enough to find an HP-branded WiFi card that was compatible with the laptop and on the whitelist.

Next, we needed to modify the WiFi card to match the HP Pavilion laptop's identifier as listed in the whitelist. This involved finding the identifier of the original WiFi card and copying it onto the new WiFi card.

To do this, we used a software tool called a BIOS editor, which allowed us to modify the BIOS and whitelist the new WiFi card.

The next step was to open up the laptop and replace the old WiFi card with the new one. This was a relatively easy task as we had previously replaced laptop hardware.

Once the new card was installed, we booted up the HP Pavilion laptop, and to our surprise, the new WiFi card was working perfectly!

We were ecstatic that our crazy hack worked, and we had a working WiFi card. The best part was that we did not need the admin password to replace the WiFi card.

In conclusion, if you are faced with a similar situation where you need to replace your laptop's WiFi card without the admin password, do not give up. With a bit of research and creativity, you can find a way around it. Our crazy hack may not be practical for everyone, but it did work for us. Remember to be careful when tinkering with the BIOS, as it can cause irreparable damage to your laptop if not done correctly.

## Chosen Solution
 How can I reset my Admin Password without a reset disk and then replace my WIFI card so that I can access the internet again.  USB ports ask for the password when I try to load software to correct the issue.

 im assuming youre talking about the ADMIN password when you try to access your router settings via a browser.
There should be a physical reset button on the router, that resets the Admin name, and password to factory defaults.
