Introduction
If you own an iMac, you already know that it is a powerful machine. However, what if I told you that you could unlock even more mind-blowing performance from your iMac? The secret lies in upgrading your CPU processor. In this article, we will outline the steps you need to take to upgrade your iMac's CPU and where to get the processor from.

Step 1: Check Compatibility
The first thing you need to do is check for compatibility. Here is a list of iMac models that support CPU upgrades:

• iMac (27-inch, Late 2012)
• iMac (Late 2013 to 2017)
• iMac Pro

If you own one of the models above, you are in luck. You can proceed to the next step.

Step 2: Find The Right CPU Processor
Now you need to find the right CPU processor for your iMac. This can be tricky, but fear not, we've got you covered.

Your best bet is to go with a reputable dealer who specializes in Mac components. We recommend either MacSales or iFixit for your CPU processor upgrade. Both have a wide range of available CPU processors to choose, and they provide user-friendly guides to assist you with the installation process. 

Step 3: Installation
This is probably the most important step of the entire process. You could have the best CPU processor in the world but if it's not installed correctly, it could be useless.

If you are not comfortable performing the upgrade yourself, an Apple Authorized Service Provider can offer assistance with installation. Otherwise, sites like iFixit provides user-friendly guides for the installation process.

Step 4: Enjoy the performance upgrade
After the successful installation of the new CPU processor, it's time to witness the impressive performance upgrade.

An upgraded processor will allow for more efficient multitasking, faster data processing and better graphics performance. These upgrades are especially beneficial for graphic designers, hard-core gamers, and video editors. Not to mention, your iMac's overall lifespan will improve. 

Conclusion
Upgrading your iMac's CPU processor isn't a quick process, but it's worth it if you want an increase in performance. Make sure to check compatibility, find the right CPU processor, properly install it or seek assistance, and enjoy the insane performance upgrade.

## Chosen Solution
 So apparently I can upgrade the CPU to 4.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 but I am new to all of this and have no idea where to buy it. Which one is compatible with my computer and from which reputable, trusted store?
iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015)

 Take a serious look at the guides before you even try. This isn’t like a PC where it doesn’t involve major surgery and you can revert back without a major disassembly plus information is easier to come by - even if it’s official validation data provided by support in a forum. The job is a total PITA on the iMac and Apple isn’t open about it and actively goes out of their way to hide it. This guide should give you a good idea of what you’re about to attempt - make your judgements carefully since any system damage will be $$$ expensive to correct. It’s doable, but can only be pushed up to a 6700K, which may not be enough of an improvement to justify the significantly more difficult install. Compare it to your *current* CPU before buying anything.
Your money will be better spent on RAM and an SSD. Most people get a system with a CPU that performs so closely to the original it's not worth risking needing an expensive motherboard to gain a marginal speed bump. It only ever makes sense if you got a i3 one and are willing to go all in and max the CPU out.
