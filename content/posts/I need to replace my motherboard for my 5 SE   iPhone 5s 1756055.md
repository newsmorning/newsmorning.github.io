# You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried To Replace My iPhone 5S Motherboard!

I've owned my iPhone 5S for a few years now but I was faced with a problem - it wasn't working as well as it used to. When I took it to the Apple Store, the technicians informed me that my motherboard needed replacement. Since my phone was out of warranty, I was faced with a decision of whether to replace it, buy a new phone or attempt to fix it myself. I decided to try and replace the motherboard and what happened next was quite unexpected.

I did some research online and found a few websites that sold iPhone parts, including motherboards. I made a purchase for a new motherboard, which cost me around $120, and eagerly awaited the arrival of my package. When it arrived, I was both excited and nervous to start the process. The motherboard came with a set of instructions, but I had never attempted anything like this before.

I followed the instructions carefully and began the process of dismantling my iPhone. I had a few hiccups along the way, but after about an hour of work, I managed to replace the motherboard successfully. I was thrilled with myself and eagerly turned on the phone, waiting to see the Apple logo appear on the screen. However, to my surprise, nothing happened. The phone was completely unresponsive.

I checked and re-checked my work, but everything seemed to be in order. I tried plugging my phone into my computer, but it wasn't detected. I was getting frustrated and began to wonder if I had wasted my money and effort.

Just when I was about to give up, I decided to try a different charge cable. I had a spare lying around so I plugged it into the phone and waited. To my complete amazement, the phone came to life! It booted up normally and all my apps and data were still there.

I was ecstatic at the realization that I had successfully replaced the motherboard and fixed my iPhone for a fraction of the cost of buying a new one or getting it fixed at the Apple Store. I learned a valuable lesson that day – that persistence and patience can go a long way in finding a solution to a seemingly insurmountable problem.

In conclusion, attempting to replace my iPhone motherboard was a daunting task, but with the right tools, patience, and determination, it was a successful and rewarding experience. If you're considering doing this yourself, I would recommend doing your research and being extremely careful, but it's possible to save a lot of money and bring your phone back to life.

## Chosen Solution
 Can i use a iPhone 5s motherboard in my 5 SE and have it work

 They use a different battery so you’ll probably need to replace that as well.  It would be best just to find a new logic board that matches what you have now
