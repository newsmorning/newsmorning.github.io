Title: Apple's Newest iPhone SE Has a SHOCKING Secret - DIY Headphone Jack Hack That'll Blow Your Mind!

Introduction:

Apple has always been the trendsetter when it comes to introducing innovative technology for its users. The company recent launch of the iPhone SE has once again made headlines in the industry. However, it's not just the features and specifications that are catching everyone's attention. The latest iPhone SE has a hidden secret that has come as a pleasant surprise for Apple users. The device can hack the headphone jack! You read that right. Apple has made a way for users to once again use their 3.5mm headphone jack with the new iPhone SE. Here's how.

Section 1: The Backstory of Apple Removing the Headphone Jack

Ever since Apple released the iPhone 7 and later versions, the company removed the headphone jack. The decision sparked controversy and debate among users and tech enthusiasts worldwide. While Apple's justification for removing the headphone jack was to make the device slimmer and more water-resistant, it didn't make the transition any easier for users.

Section 2: The DIY Hack

Fast forward to the present, and Apple has silently introduced a DIY hack for the latest iPhone SE model. Apple has included three holes on the left-hand side of the devices that can restore functionality to the headphone jack. All one needs to do is open the iPhone's SIM tray and insert a DIY headphone jack adapter. This adapter works similarly to the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack and is compatible with most headphones, earbuds, and speakers.

Section 3: Why This Is a Significant Development

The inclusion of the DIY hack is a significant development because it addresses one of the most significant complaints that users had with recent iPhone models. The lack of a headphone jack was inconvenient for users who still had wired headphones or had to switch between wired and wireless headphones. This hack is a testament to Apple's commitment to listening to user feedback and making improvements to their products.

Conclusion:

Apple's newest iPhone SE has come as a pleasant surprise for iPhone users. The company's decision to include a DIY hack to restore functionality to the headphone jack has solved a longstanding problem for iPhone users. The inclusion of the hack is not just a sign of Apple's willingness to listen to user feedback, but also a demonstration of their constant innovation and desire to improve their products.

## Chosen Solution
 I tried the answer section, but found this part of the website.
The headphone jack only is what doesn’t work. I looked inside the port, and the metal balls and surrounding plastic is a little damaged, maybe the balls are pushed in? I tried fiddling and cleaning it , maybe made it worse.
I don’t want to replace the whole flex cable, security reason (no third party or used microphone and lightning port microcontroller).
can I cut the  flex on a 5s and transplant/microsolder the 3.5mm jack flex copper leads on the SE dock?
Is there any other way?

 I seem to recall @jessabethany has a video where she replaces the headphone jack on an SE or a 5S, but I am not finding it scrolling through her catalog. But I would wager this is fine. Headphone jacks are electrically quite simple. As long it fits and the contacts are for the same electrical lines, I don’t see why transplanted it wouldn’t work. Although there may be some desolder/solder operations that need to be done.
