# Unlock the Secret of Deferred Compensation Plans - Discover Meaning, Types, and Real Life Examples!

As an employee, you want to earn as much as you can, so that you can comfortably meet your financial goals. However, taxes may reduce your net income, taking a chunk of your earnings away. Fortunately, there's a way you can defer a portion of your compensation, and reduce the taxes you pay on it - deferred compensation plans.

In this article, we will explore the meaning, types, and real-life examples of deferred compensation plans.

## Understanding Deferred Compensation Plans

Deferred compensation plans, simply defined, are plans that allow employees to defer a portion of their income to a future date. This income includes any part of your compensation, such as bonuses or stock options, that you can defer and receive at a later time.

When you defer your compensation, you don't have to pay taxes on it immediately. Instead, you pay taxes on the funds when you withdraw them from the plan, typically at a lower tax rate. This allows you to reduce the tax payable on your income now and potentially save more.

## Types of Deferred Compensation Plans

There are two main types of deferred compensation plans: qualified and non-qualified. 

Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans are typically offered by employers, and they comply with the tax code governing retirement plans. These plans are also known as qualified retirement plans, and they include 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and pensions. The key advantage of these plans is that contributions are made pre-tax, which means they are tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until you withdraw the funds in retirement.

On the other hand, non-qualified deferred compensation plans do not need to meet the strict regulations that qualified plans do. Non-qualified plans are typically used as a supplemental retirement savings vehicle, in addition to the qualified plans. They also allow the deferral of compensation above and beyond that allowed by qualified plans. Examples include executive bonus plans, deferred compensation agreements, and top-hat plans.

## Real Life Examples of Deferred Compensation Plans

Deferred compensation plans are commonly used by executives and high earners, but they can also be used by anyone to save for retirement. Here are a few real-life examples of deferred compensation plans:

### 1. 401(k)

A 401(k) is the most common type of deferred compensation plan offered by employers. This plan allows employees to defer a portion of their pre-tax income into the plan, which is then invested for retirement. The contributions and earnings grow tax-free, and taxes are paid when the funds are withdrawn from the plan.

### 2. Deferred Compensation Agreement

A deferred compensation agreement is a contract between an employer and employee that allows the employee to defer a portion of their compensation until a future date. These agreements come in different forms, such as a cash-deferral plan or a stock-option deferral plan.

### 3. Executive Bonus Plans

Executive bonus plans are designed to allow executives and top-earning employees to defer a portion of their bonus compensation to the future. These plans create incentives for executives to meet performance metrics, and the funds deferred accumulate interest or are invested.

## Conclusion

Deferred compensation plans can be a valuable tool for employees to plan for retirement and save on taxes. By understanding the meaning, types, and real-life examples of these plans, you can determine which plan is best for you and make informed decisions on how to use them to meet your financial goals. Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to guide you through the process of choosing a deferred compensation plan that works best for you.

### How Deferred Compensation Works?
 
A deferred compensation plan allows individuals to keep aside a fraction of their income untaxed until withdrawn. In addition, the taxable amount also decreases for the current year, thereby providing significant tax benefits to employees for the term.
 
Companies withhold a portion of the monthly compensation of employees and store it over time until the predetermined date arrives. On the date as per the employment contract, the employers pay a lump sum to their employees.
 
Employees can opt for a plan based on their tax situation. For example, if they expect the future income tax rate to be lower than the current rate, they can opt for the programs offering potential tax benefitsTax BenefitsTax benefits refer to the credit that a business receives on its tax liability for complying with a norm proposed by the government.

On the contrary, if employees expect that the future tax rate will be higher, they can opt for plans offering tax deduction options at the time of investment and not at distribution.
 
Moreover, other factors that might affect employees’ decisions include the country’s economic situation, government-extended benefits, prospective tax laws, etc.
 
### Types of Deferred Compensation
 
Deferred compensation nationwide is broadly classified as Qualified and Non – Qualified.
 
#### #1 – Qualified Deferred Compensation
 
These are the strictly governed plans monitored and administered under standard rules and regulations. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) sets the laws that govern this compensation option. Also, it restricts depositing amounts beyond a certain limit.
 
The qualified option keeps the saved amount of employees secure. This is because ERISA does not allow employers to touch that portion of the company’s fund at any cost, no matter how worst the financial situation becomes for a business.
 
The qualified compensation is for the benefit of the recipient only. The law does not allow companies to use it to pay off creditorsCreditorsA creditor refers to a party involving an individual, institution, or the government that extends credit or lends goods, property, services, or money to another party known as a debtor. The credit made through a legal contract guarantees repayment within a specified period as mutually agreed upon by both parties.

#### #2 – Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC)
 
As ERISA imposes restrictions on qualified options, a non-qualified compensation alternative came into existence. This alternative had no legal monitoring and control bindings. However, the most significant difference is that these options did not limit the amount to withhold for payment at a later stage.
 
NQDCs are for those who earn high and desire to save more without any restriction. As a result, such employees get an opportunity to have even lower taxable income and enjoy better returns on tax-deferred investments.
 
Though the returns expected are higher, these are not safe options. Unlike qualified alternatives, companies can use these portions of employees’ income to pay off their debtsDebtsDebt is the practice of borrowing a tangible item, primarily money by an individual, business, or government, from another person, financial institution, or state.read more. In addition, as there is no law to govern this compensation type, the employees cannot expect authorities to take any actions upon reporting the incident.
 
### Examples
 
Moving further, let us consider the following examples to understand the concept well:
 
#### Example #1
 
Scarlet has an income of $250,000 per annum, and she opts to defer her compensation using non-qualified deferred compensation. Thus, she agrees to save $50,000 every month to her NQDC account for 15 years. At the time of withdrawal, however, she knew she would receive $9 million as a lump sum for a further tax deduction.
 
She was happy to see the huge tax benefit she was enjoying. However, during the 10th year, her company filed for bankruptcy, and it used her ten years of savings to pay off its debt. Scarlet contacted the management, but they did not entertain her. As the plan was under no legal regulation, the authorities did not address her complaints, and she lost all her money.
 
#### Example #2
 
After its merger with Bank of America, Merrill refused to settle the deferred compensation for brokers. It stated that the company does not allow broker compensation if they do not remain in the firm for a specific tenure. The brokers proved that the company’s contract allows employees to leave for “good reason.” After a long legal battle, the brand agreed to pay $40 million for a class actionClass ActionA Class Action Lawsuit is a legal remedy when a person acts or represents for himself on behalf of a group of individuals in a lawsuit where the nature of the other plaintiffs’ cases is similar.read more settlement with 1,400 brokers in 2012.
