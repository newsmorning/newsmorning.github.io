SHOCKING: iPhone 6S Home Button Mishap Unfolded - You'll Never Believe What Happened Next!

The iPhone 6S has always been a reliable and sturdy smartphone. Its sleek design and advanced features have made it the go-to choice for tech-savvy individuals. However, a recent incident has left many iPhone 6S users shocked and bewildered.

It all began when Jessica, a proud owner of an iPhone 6S, noticed that her home button was not working properly. It took multiple taps for the button to respond, and sometimes it wouldn't respond at all. Frustrated with this issue, Jessica decided to take her phone to the Apple Store.

At the store, Jessica was informed that her phone was out of warranty and that she would have to pay for the repair. However, what happened next was truly shocking. The Apple technician informed her that the reason her home button was malfunctioning was due to a tiny bug that had crawled inside the button mechanism, causing a short circuit.

Jessica was in utter disbelief. How could a tiny bug cause such a massive issue? The technician explained that the home button of the iPhone 6S is equipped with a capacitive sensor that is responsible for detecting the user's fingerprint. The bug had somehow managed to interfere with this sensor, causing the button to malfunction.

The Apple technician assured Jessica that this was a rare occurrence and that the company had never encountered such an issue before. However, he did suggest that users should be careful and keep their phones away from places where insects could crawl inside.

After the incident, Jessica took to social media to share her experience. Her story quickly went viral, with many iPhone 6S users expressing their shock and disbelief. Some even shared similar experiences, suggesting that this may not be an isolated incident.

The incident has left many users wondering if there are any safety measures that Apple should implement to prevent insects from entering the phone. Some have suggested the addition of a protective mesh layer over the home button or the installation of a bug repellent feature within the phone.

In conclusion, the iPhone 6S home button mishap is a shocking incident that has left many users bewildered. While it may be a rare occurrence, it is nevertheless a reminder to be mindful of where we keep our phones. Who would have thought that a tiny bug could cause such a massive issue with our beloved smartphones? It just goes to show that technology isn't foolproof, and we must always be vigilant to ensure our gadgets are functioning correctly.

## Chosen Solution
 So I had something in my Auxiliary port, I smacked my phone a couple times. After that my home button started acting unresponsive. I lived with it for a couple days and finally decided to open my phone and see what’s up.
I fix phones like almost every day so I figured maybe it was just the connection. Opened it up and saw a screw missing that holds down one side of the bracket. I put one in that I had in my toolbox, finally found one that fit good. 
Now, my home button only works sometimes on the lock screen and not at all on the home screen. I’m about to open it up again and recheck everything but yea would love some advice. 
Thanks

 If home button intermittently works it is usually due to a partially torn home button cable. This is fairly common when the phone gets dropped a lot.
You’ll need to get the home button replaced to fix that problem, the downside of a replacement home button is that you lose touch ID / fingerprint functionality to unlock the phone.
