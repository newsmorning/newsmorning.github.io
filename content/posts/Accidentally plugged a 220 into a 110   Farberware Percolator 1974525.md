# Disaster Strikes: Woman Accidentally Plugs 220V into 110V Farberware Percolator

Electricity is one of the modern world's greatest inventions. It powers everything from our homes to our workplaces, our vehicles, and even our entertainment. However, it can also be incredibly dangerous if not used correctly. This is exactly what happened when a woman accidentally plugged a 220V appliance into a 110V outlet, causing a disaster to unfold.

The woman in question had purchased a Farberware Percolator, which is an electric coffee maker that requires 110V power to operate. Unfortunately, when she returned home, she plugged the coffee maker into a 220V outlet, causing an electrical overload that resulted in a lot of smoke and a burning smell.

This mistake could have been a life-changing one for the woman and her family. According to safety experts, appliances are designed to work with a specific voltage, and plugging them into the wrong voltage can cause severe damage. In this case, the overload caused by plugging a 220V coffee maker into a 110V outlet could have led to an electrical fire, putting the woman and her family at risk.

Luckily, the woman realized her mistake quickly and unplugged the coffee maker from the outlet. However, the damage had already been done. The overload had caused the coffee maker's internal wiring, circuits, and components to fry, rendering the machine useless. The woman had to spend money to replace the coffee maker or repair it, should she want to.

This incident is a cautionary tale for consumers, especially those who purchase electrical appliances that require a specific voltage. Before plugging in an appliance, ensure that the outlet's voltage matches the appliance's requirement. It is recommended to read the labels on the appliance or its packaging to avoid such errors.

In conclusion, electrical safety cannot be overstated. The dangers of electricity are hidden, and a seemingly small mistake like plugging an appliance into the wrong outlet can have catastrophic consequences. By being vigilant and following the manufacturer's specifications for electrical appliances, we can prevent disasters from happening. Stay safe and always be careful when handling electrical appliances!


## Chosen Solution
 I am overseas and forgot to use a down converter to plug in my American Farberware percolator. I consequently blew it out, and Iâ€™m wondering if there is a way to fix it. Is there a fuse I can replace?

 Amy cook could be  a (thermal)fuse as well as a couple of other things (filter capacitor, thermostat, etc. are a good possibility). You will have to disassemble it and post some pictures of what you find with your question. That way we can see what you see. Adding images to an existing question
Not sure which model you have but this video should get you into it.
