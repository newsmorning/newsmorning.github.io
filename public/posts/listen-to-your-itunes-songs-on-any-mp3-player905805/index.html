With the help of a few simple tools, you can now play your cherished music tracks on any MP3 player, regardless of the manufacturer.\nHere’s how.\nStep 1: Convert iTunes music to MP3 format\nThe first thing you need to do is convert your iTunes music tracks to the MP3 format. This is necessary because most non-Apple MP3 players don’t support the AAC format used by iTunes. Luckily, there are several free and paid tools that can do this conversion for you.\nOne of the best free options is the iTunes itself. You can go to Preferences in the iTunes menu, choose “Import Settings”, and then choose “Import Using” and then “MP3.” This will automatically convert any new music you add to your iTunes library to the MP3 format.\nIf you’d prefer a simpler way to convert your existing iTunes music to MP3 format, you can use dedicated tools like Freemake Audio Converter, or Streaming Audio Recorder, all of which are free.\nStep 2: Transfer MP3 files to your MP3 player\nOnce you’ve converted your iTunes music tracks to MP3 format, the next step is to transfer them to your MP3 player. To do this, connect your MP3 player to your computer using a USB cable. Then, open the folder where your MP3 player is connected on your computer.\nDepending on your MP3 player’s manufacturer, you may need to follow specific instructions to transfer music. For example, some MP3 players require you to use dedicated software, while others let you drag-and-drop files directly onto the device.\nIf you’re unsure of how to transfer music to your MP3 player, check the instructions that came with the device, or visit the manufacturer’s website for support.\nStep 3: Enjoy your iTunes music on any MP3 player!\nAnd that’s it! With just a few simple steps, you can now enjoy your iTunes music library on any MP3 player you wish.\nWhether you’re looking to save money by not having to buy an expensive iPod, or you simply prefer the design and functionality of a non-Apple MP3 player, this method works like a charm.\nSo, next time you’re feeling restricted by Apple’s ecosystem, remember that there’s a world of MP3 players out there that can play your iTunes music just as well, if not better!\nThis article explains how to convert music on a computer to MP3 format and move it to an MP3 player. These directions apply to iTunes 12.9 and newer on Windows 10 PCs, to iTunes on macOS Mojave (10.14) and earlier, and to the Music app in macOS Catalina (10.15) and later.\nWhat to Know\nConvert to MP3 format: In iTunes or Music, select songs and go to File \u003e Convert \u003e Create MP3 version or use a third-party file converter.Put MP3s on your player: Attach your MP3 player to your computer.
