# Shocking Discovery Revealed for Honda Accord Owners! Are You Making this Critical Mistake with Your 1998-2002 Model? Click Here to Find Out!

As a Honda Accord owner, you take great pride in your car's performance, reliability, and longevity. However, a recent study has uncovered a shocking discovery that could be affecting your 1998-2002 Honda Accord's airbag system and putting you and your passengers at risk. Keep reading to learn more about this critical mistake and how to avoid it.

The problem lies with the Takata airbag inflators, which were used on many Honda vehicles from 2001 to 2016. These inflators can rupture during deployment, which can lead to serious injury or death due to shrapnel and other debris being thrown throughout your vehicle. The issue with the Honda Accord's airbag system stems from the use of ammonium nitrate as a propellant in the Takata inflators. Over time, the ammonium nitrate can become unstable, making the inflator more likely to rupture during deployment.

To make matters worse, Honda has announced an urgent recall for these inflators, which are affecting millions of Honda vehicles worldwide. If you own a 1998-2002 Honda Accord, there is a high chance that your airbag inflator is affected by this recall, and you need to take immediate action. Failure to do so could lead to a catastrophic accident that could cause serious injury or death.

To check whether your Honda Accord is affected by this recall, visit Honda's recall website and enter your vehicle identification number (VIN). If your car is on the list, contact your local Honda dealer as soon as possible to schedule a free repair. Honda has recalled affected vehicles in phases, based on the age of the car and the region where it's located.

If you're unsure whether your Honda Accord's airbag inflator has been replaced, your best course of action is to contact your local Honda dealer and schedule an inspection. A qualified technician will be able to check whether your airbag system is affected by the recall and provide a free repair if needed. Alternatively, you can also contact Honda's customer service hotline at 1-888-234-2138 for further assistance.

In conclusion, if you own a 1998-2002 Honda Accord, it's critical that you check whether your airbag system is affected by the Takata inflator recall. This critical mistake could be putting your life and the lives of your passengers at risk, so don't delay and take action today to ensure your car is safe to drive. Remember, safety always comes first, and there's nothing more important than protecting yourself and your loved ones while on the road.

## Chosen Solution
 2002 Honda Accord Car died on freeway gages jumped stereo flashed… So the headlights, horn, power widows don’t work car cranks but won’t start. We replaced ignition switch, main relay, MICU and left side fuse box. We’ve lost power to both interior fuse boxes and we are only getting 4 volts of power from main relay harness?

 Sounds like something is shorting causing everything to ground out making the connection to them live. It would explain everything going on like the horn, lights and more as the current could pass through them completing there circuit and making them go off. I'd look for any exposed wires and things like that and of you're only getting 4v the rest of that voltage has to be going somewhere. Also check if the battery is still giving the required voltage out and if it is then follow the leads and look for any thing out of place from the origin to the end and work from there.
