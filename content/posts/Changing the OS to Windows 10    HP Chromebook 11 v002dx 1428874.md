- Release all three buttons when the "Chrome OS is missing or damaged" screen appears.
- Press Ctrl + D to enable Developer Mode.
- Wait for your Chromebook to reboot, then press Enter to confirm.

Step 5: Install Windows 10

Now that you're in Developer Mode, you can install Windows 10 on your HP Chromebook 11 V002Dx. Here's how:

- Insert your Windows 10 installation USB drive into your Chromebook.
- Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the Chrome Terminal.
