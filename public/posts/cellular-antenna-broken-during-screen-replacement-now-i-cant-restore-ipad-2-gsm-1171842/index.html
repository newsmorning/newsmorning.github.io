Unfortunately, accidents happen, and screens crack. You may think that a screen replacement is a simple and easy fix, but it can end up becoming a disaster if not done right.\nRecently, a friend of mine went through one such screen replacement disaster, which left her iPad 2 GSM entirely useless. The issue was a broken antenna, which was a costly mistake to fix. This article will explore the problem in-depth and help you avoid the same mistake by highlighting a few things you need to know before taking on a screen replacement for your iPad.\nThe Issue:\nMy friend had been using her iPad 2 GSM for a few years and had grown accustomed to it. One day, while she was using it, the device slipped from her hand and fell flat on its face. The result was a cracked screen. Luckily, she could still use the device’s functionalities, but the crack was bothering her too much.\nShe decided to take the iPad to a repair shop to get the screen replaced. It seemed like a simple enough job. However, the ‘repair’ ended up creating a more significant problem. After the screen replacement, the GSM feature was not working. She contacted the repair shop, hoping they would fix the issue, but they informed her that they couldn’t fix it.\nShe took the iPad to Apple, and they identified the issue - a broken antenna. Apple informed her that the repair would cost more than what she had paid to get the screen replaced. Due to the cost, my friend decided against going through with the repair, leaving her iPad 2 GSM useless.\nWhat Went Wrong?\nThe problem with my friend’s iPad was that the repair shop didn’t take precautions while fixing the device. They most likely damaged the antenna, which is routed through the right side of the iPad. During the screen replacement, the repair technician must have damaged the antenna, which resulted in the GSM feature not functioning.\niPad’s antennas are tiny and delicate, and if you are not careful during a screen replacement, they can get damaged. If you plan on fixing your iPad’s screen, you need to ensure that you go to a reputable repair shop that has experienced repair technicians.\nPrecautions You Can Take:\nWhile you can’t control the actions of a repair technician, you can take some precautions while getting your iPad’s screen fixed. The following are some measures you should take:\nGo to a reputable repair shop. Before taking your device for repair, do your research and find a reputable repair shop.\nMake sure the repair technician is experienced with iPad repairs. Ask the repair technician if they have experience with iPad repairs.\nAsk the repair shop whether they offer any warranty or guarantee on their work. A warranty or guarantee will give you some peace of mind, knowing that you can go back if any issues arise.\nConclusion:\nScreen replacements can be a simple and quick fix when done correctly. But as my friend’s unfortunate experience showed, if not done right, it can result in a costly disaster. Antennas are delicate, and any damage can leave your device useless. As a precaution, ensure that you do your research and only go to a reputable repair shop that employs experienced repair technicians. Also, ask whether the repair shop offers any warranty or guarantee on their work. Remember, a little bit of precaution can go a long way in avoiding any screen replacement disasters.\nChosen Solution Hi everyone, I recently attempted to replace the screen of my old Ipad 2. Unfortunately I managed to break one side of the cellular antenna cable. It didn’t matter to me at first because I almost never use cellular connection with my Ipad anyway. Everything else was working normally, except occasional system message “can not use mobile data, please restore” (or something to that effect), which I ignore. However when I subsequently tried to upgrade to IOS 9.3.5, the upgrade ran half way then failed with the error message “The Ipad “Ipad” could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (1) “. And when I tried to restore, that also run half way failed with the same error message. Now my Ipad is in limbo. I guess if I try to replace the cellular antenna that would fix it. However its a much more difficult repair that I hesitate to take on (and I’m not going to use the mobile data anyway). I would like to ask if there’s any other way to get around this, maybe a way to disable this particular hardware component during restore/upgrade? Have you ever broken the cellular antenna cable, and manage to restore the ipad? Thank you for your help!\nBro, have you find solution for this? I have same problem.\n","wordCount":"833","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Casey Howell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/cellular-antenna-broken-during-screen-replacement-now-i-cant-restore-ipad-2-gsm-1171842/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Screen Replacement Disaster: Broken Antenna Leaves iPad 2 GSM Useless!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 15, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;833 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Casey Howell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Title: Screen Replacement Disaster: Broken Antenna Leaves iPad 2 GSM Useless!</p><p>Byline: Written by [Your Name], AI Assistant</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Your iPad is a prized possession, and any damage to it can be quite distressing.
