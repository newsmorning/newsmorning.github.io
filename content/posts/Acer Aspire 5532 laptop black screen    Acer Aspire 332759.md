# 5532 - The Shocking Reason Your Laptop Screen is Completely Black!

Laptops have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. From online classes to remote working, laptops have made our lives easier in countless ways. However, nothing is more frustrating than a black screen on your laptop. 

Imagine this - you have an important presentation to give, and your laptop screen suddenly goes black. Panic sets in, and you start to wonder what could be the reason behind it. Well, the answer lies in a component known as the inverter.

### What is an Inverter, and How Does it Work?

An inverter is a component that is responsible for converting the DC voltage from your laptop’s battery into AC voltage that powers your laptop’s backlight. Without an inverter, you won’t be able to see anything on your laptop’s screen.

### The Shocking Reason behind a Black Screen

The inverter is a critical component of your laptop, and any problem with it can cause the screen to go black. So, what is the shocking reason behind it? Well, most often, the inverter fails due to overheating.

Laptops generate a lot of heat, and the inverter is placed in close proximity to the heat-generating components. Over time, the heat can cause the inverter’s capacitors to fail, resulting in a black screen.

Apart from overheating, the inverter can also fail due to a power surge or a faulty connection. In either case, you need to get your laptop checked by a professional technician.

### What to Do if Your Laptop Screen is Black?

If your laptop screen is black, here are a few things you can do to troubleshoot the problem:

- First, check if the laptop is turned on. Sometimes, the laptop may be in sleep mode, and all you need to do is press a button to wake it up.
- Check if the battery is charged. If the battery is dead, your laptop won’t turn on, and the screen will remain black.
- If the battery is charged, but the screen is still black, try connecting your laptop to an external monitor. If the external monitor works, then the problem is with your laptop’s screen or the inverter.
- If none of the above solutions work, then it’s time to take your laptop to a professional technician. They will diagnose the problem and suggest the best solution.

In conclusion, a black screen on your laptop can be frustrating, but it’s not the end of the world. Most often, the problem lies with the inverter, which can fail due to overheating or other issues. By troubleshooting the problem and seeking professional help, you can get your laptop back up and running in no time.

## Chosen Solution
 At the beginning of 2015, I bought a new laptop, Acer Aspire 15634 with windows 8.1. This afternoon when I turned my computer on, the power light was indeed on but the screen was completely black. I tried to restart my computer numerous times, included with and without the battery and power cord. After numerous trials, the results were the same. Just a complete black screen. Does anyone know how to fix this? Please help me I don't want to have to buy another laptop when I know that this was completely fine before the incident.

 Sounds like the LCD went out on your laptop.  If you bought it in 2015 it should still be under warranty.  I would check with the place you bought it and see if they can assist with a warranty replacement/repair.  If they can't, then contact Acer
