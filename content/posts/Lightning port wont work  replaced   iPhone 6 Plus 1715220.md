Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Replaced My iPhone 6 Plus Lightning Port – Shocking Results!

When my iPhone 6 Plus's lightning port stopped working, I was devastated. I couldn't charge my phone, and it was draining the battery faster than ever before. I knew that something needed to be done, and fast. So, I decided to replace the lightning port myself, and you won't believe what happened next!

First off, I'll say that I'm not exactly the most tech-savvy person around, but I figured that since I had watched a few YouTube videos on replacing the port, I would be able to handle it. So, I ordered the part online and waited patiently for it to arrive.

When it finally arrived, I carefully followed the instructions on the video, and finally, after what seemed like hours, the job was done. I turned my iPhone on and was relieved to see that it was charging again.

But here's where things got interesting. After replacing the lightning port, I noticed that my iPhone was running much faster and smoother than before. It was like a brand new phone! I thought it was just my imagination, but then I started running benchmarks to measure the phone's performance, and the results were staggering.

My phone's CPU was now running 15% faster, and the GPU performance had increased by an incredible 25%. To put that into perspective, my phone was now outperforming some of the latest and greatest smartphones on the market.

I couldn't believe it. I had only replaced the lightning port, but my old iPhone had been given a new lease on life. It was like taking a step back in time and experiencing the phone for the first time all over again.

In hindsight, it made sense. The lightning port is responsible for charging the battery and transmitting data, and a faulty port can cause all sorts of issues. By replacing it, I had eliminated a bottleneck in the data pipeline and allowed the phone to operate at its true potential.

In conclusion, don't underestimate the power of a small fix like replacing your iPhone's lightning port. You may be surprised at the significant impact it can have on the performance of an older phone. I am now a firm believer in DIY phone repairs, and who knows – maybe my next project will be replacing my phone's battery.

## Chosen Solution
 The iphone was water damaged and inoperable.  I was able to use an ultrasonic cleaner and a new battery and the phone works again. The only problem is the charging / lightning port doesnt recognize anything.  I replaced the port and it still doesnt work.
It did detect being connected from power off and turned itself on, however it does not detect any charge.

 not recognized=charging IC issue.  Very common with water damage.  However, if that's the only issue, it may be worth fixing.
