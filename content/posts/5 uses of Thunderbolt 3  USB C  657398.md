# Revolutionize Your Tech Game: Discover the Top 5 Surprising Uses of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C You Never Knew Existed!

Are you ready to take your tech game to the next level? Then it's time to tap into the power of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C, the latest innovation in data transfer technology. Thunderbolt 3 is not just about speed, it is also packed with features that you would not have thought were possible with a single cable. In this article, we will explore the top 5 surprising uses of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C that you never knew existed. 

## 1. Connecting Multiple Displays 

Do you want to expand your work space and use multiple displays without purchasing a new graphics card? The good news is that Thunderbolt 3 USB-C can connect up to two 4K displays at 60Hz, which means you can run multiple monitors with just one dock. The dual 4K support ensures unsurpassed viewing and helps bring your creative vision to life. 

## 2. Fast Charging 

We all know the frustration of running out of charge in the middle of an important meeting or conference. With Thunderbolt 3 USB-C, you can enjoy fast charging, regardless of the device you’re using. Thunderbolt 3 can charge laptops and tablets with up to 100W of power, which means you can get a full charge in no time. Additionally, you can utilize a single Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port to charge phones, cameras, and other devices, making it a charging station of sorts. 

## 3. Network Connectivity 

Thunderbolt 3 USB-C enables you to access the internet on the go with a wired connection. Most business travellers and digital nomads know that sometimes Wi-Fi signals are weak or, sometimes, inaccessible. With Thunderbolt 3 USB-C, you can connect to the internet through an Ethernet cable without having to worry about a weak Wi-Fi signal.

## 4. Quick Data Transfer 

Thunderbolt 3 USB-C is not just great for fast charging but an incredible solution for data transfer. The transfer speed of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C is up to 40 Gbps, which means you can move large files between devices incredibly quickly. In fact, with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C you can transfer a 4K ultra-high-definition video file in just one minute. This feature is a game-changer for professional video editors and photographers who need to transfer large files quickly.

## 5. Daisy Chaining Devices 

If you’re someone who works with multiple peripherals, then you’ll love the Thunderbolt 3 USB-C's daisy-chaining feature. This feature allows you to connect up to six peripherals to one Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port. For instance, you can connect a dock to a monitor, and then add in other devices like an external hard drive, a mouse, and a keyboard, and all of them will run seamlessly. 

In conclusion, Thunderbolt 3 USB-C is an innovative and incredibly efficient technology that has revolutionized the tech game for businesses and home users alike. The ability to charge, transfer data, and use multiple devices through a single cable is nothing less than remarkable. With these 5 surprising uses of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C, you can say goodbye to tech frustrations and enjoy a new level of efficiency and productivity.

As far as a laptop or computer is concerned, ports are very vital components; they are just as important as the computer itself. And looking back, old generation of computers used to sport as many as 7 (and more) type of different ports, each with its own individual function. Now, thanks to technological advancements, and the need to make laptops slimmer and more portable, manufacturers have shrunk down on the number and sizes of ports embedded on a laptop — thanks to USB-C.
 
ThunderBolt USB-C, on the other hand, is the latest version of Thunderbolt, based on the USB-C port technology, and is the most versatile port ever made. The connector is rapidly being adopted and used by many manufacturers on their products (smartphones and laptops). However, you should know that the ThunderBolt technology is (presently) available on devices with Intel processors.
 

 
In fact, it is the only type of connection port you’d find on some PC laptops (like the MacBook Pro). This is because the port is multi-functional, serving the purposes of more than 5 separate ports combined. Below are some of the uses of the ThunderBolt 3 USB-C ports.
 
## 5 uses of Thunderbolt 3 USB-C
 
1. Charging
 
 
 
Asides from the ability to deliver up to 100 Watts of power, the ThunderBolt USB-C port can, simultaneously, charge a device and be charge by another. This means that you can connect your PC laptop to an external display and equally charge your PC at the same time, using the same USB-C port. No other known laptop port can get this done — delivering power in both directions.
 
2. High-speed data transfer
 
As mentioned in our laptop ports guide, the ThunderBolt 3 is a USB-C port with higher and faster transfer speed than the latest and previous versions and generations of regular USB-C. A ThunderBolt 3 USB-C port can transfer data at a speed of up to 40Gbps, four times faster than USB-C 3.1 (10Gbps) and USB-C 3 (5Gbps).
 
The ThunderBolt 3 USB-C delivers the fastest connection to any device connected to it: external displays, storage disk and devices etc.
 
3. Connecting to External displays
 
About versatility, the ThunderBolt 3 port not only supports the USB protocol but also DisplayPort protocol. This means you can send audio and video signals from your computer to multiple external displays with DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort connection type.
 
Generally, the ThunderBolt 3 ports supports two 4K displays at 60fps, one 4K display at 120fps, or one 5K display at 60fps. Or if you use a top-of-the-line MacBook or iMac, you can connect up to four 4K displays or two 5K displays.
 
4. Connecting to external GPUs
 
Because the ThunderBolt 3 port is based on Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe 3) bus system, you can  upgrade you laptop’s graphical performance to desktop-class level by connecting an external graphics card and other graphics accelerator.
 
5. Network Connectivity
 
Another use of the ThunderBolt 3 port is for network connectivity. The port supports Ethernet network protocols which means it permits connection to external networks of up to 10 Gigabits. You would have to use a ThunderBolt–o-Ethernet adapter/cable, though. Similarly, ThunderBolt 3 USB-C supports superfast transfer of data of up to 10Gbps between two ThunderBolt-compatible devices in a peer-to-peer network.
 
Other uses of the ThunderBolt USB-C port include connection of: VR accessories, storage sticks, ThunderBolt storages, docks etc.
