The charging port on the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 is located on the right side of the tablet, near the bottom. The port itself is small and can be difficult to access, which can make it tricky to insert the charger correctly.

Additionally, the charging port has a flap that covers it, designed to protect it from dust and debris. While this is a great feature, it can also make it difficult to see what you're doing when you're trying to insert the charger.

Finally, the charging cable itself can also be a culprit. If it's bent or damaged in any way, it can make it difficult to insert the charger into the charging port correctly.
