If you like the concept of mini-PCs and would like to buy one in order to save up space on your desk, then you might interested to have a look at a new product coming from Intel.

Dell has unveiled a its new Inspiron Micro Desktop which runs Windows 8.1 and is aimed at users interested in the mini-PC market. You can use this new product to connect to the TV in your living room, or even a computer monitor. The device has a footprint that’s just 5.16 x 5.16 inches, so it’s really easy to place it anywhere you want.
 
There are two models available, both in black: one comes with a dual-core up-to-2.58GHz Intel Celeron J1800 processor and the other one has a more powerful quad-core up-to-2.67GHz Intel Pentium J2900. But this is reflected in their prices, of course, as the low-entry one starts at just $179 with the second one being priced at $229.
 
Both versions have 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage and run Windows 8.1 with Bing. They also include HDMI and DisplayPort connectors, along with four USB ports and a 3-in-1 card reader, as well as gigabit LAN, Bluetooth and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. The new Inspiron Micro Desktop is available now in the US, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
 
At the moment, we don’t know whether it would be possible to upgrade from Windows 8.1 with Bing to Windows 10, as those who have tried have encountered a lot of problems. Therefore, I must say that this could become a really interesting product only if the upgrade to Windows 10 was a given. Otherwise, I’d suggest you to wait for other mini-PCs which will come with Windows 10 by default.
