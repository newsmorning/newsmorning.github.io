# Discover the Secret to Fixing Your 2014 Fiat 500L Rear Windshield Wiper with Our Expert Repair Guide!


Have you been struggling with a malfunctioning rear windshield wiper on your 2014 Fiat 500L? If so, you're not alone. Broken wipers can be a frustrating problem for any car owner, but with the right tools and knowledge, you can get your wiper working like new again.

Here's your expert guide to fixing your 2014 Fiat 500L's rear windshield wiper.

## Step 1: Diagnose the Problem

The first step in fixing any car problem is to figure out what's causing the issue. Before you start taking your wiper apart or buying replacement parts, make sure you know what's wrong.

The most common issue with rear windshield wipers is a broken or damaged blade. Check the blade for cracks, breaks, or any other signs of damage. If the blade looks damaged, it needs to be replaced.

Another common problem is a faulty motor. If your wiper blade isn't moving or isn't moving smoothly, the motor might be the culprit. You'll need to remove the wiper arm and test the motor to see if it's working properly.

## Step 2: Gather Your Tools

Once you've figured out the problem, it's time to gather your tools. Here's what you'll need to fix your 2014 Fiat 500L's rear windshield wiper:

- New wiper blade (if needed)
- Socket set
- Screwdrivers
- Needle-nose pliers
- Lubricant spray

## Step 3: Remove the Wiper Blade

To replace a wiper blade, you'll need to remove the old one first. Here's how to do it:

1. Lift the wiper blade up and away from the windshield until it's in a vertical position.
2. Look for the small tab on the underside of the blade where it attaches to the arm. Press the tab to release the blade.
3. Gently pull the blade away from the arm until it's free.

## Step 4: Install the New Wiper Blade

Installing a new wiper blade is easy:

1. Remove the new wiper blade from its packaging.
2. Align the blade with the arm, making sure it's the correct size.
3. Push the blade onto the arm until you hear a click.

## Step 5: Test the Wiper

Test your wiper to make sure it's working properly. Turn the wiper on and watch it move back and forth across the windshield. If it's working, you're done! If not, move on to the next step.

## Step 6: Check the Motor

If your wiper blade isn't working properly, the motor might be the issue. Here's how to check it:

1. Remove the wiper arm and the plastic cover inside it to access the motor.
2. Test the motor by turning the key to the "On" position and turning on the wipers. Listen for a humming sound, which indicates the motor is working.
3. If the motor isn't working, you'll need to replace it.

## Step 7: Lubricate the Wiper

If your wiper blade is skipping or making noise, lubricating it can help. Here's how:

1. Lift the wiper arm up and away from the windshield.
2. Spray lubricant onto the blade and arm where they meet.
3. Move the wiper blade back and forth across the windshield to distribute the lubricant.

## Conclusion

Fixing your 2014 Fiat 500L's rear windshield wiper isn't as daunting as it might seem. By following these simple steps, you can get your wiper working like new again in no time. Happy driving!
