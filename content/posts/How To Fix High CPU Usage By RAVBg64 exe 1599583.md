Are you tired of your computer running slow? Does your system continuously show high CPU usage? If so, you're not alone. High CPU usage is a common issue that many computer users face, and it can lead to a slow and inefficient system. Fortunately, there is a simple trick you can use to fix high CPU usage and get your computer running smoothly again.

Before we dive into the solution, let's first understand what high CPU usage is and why it's a problem. Your computer's CPU (central processing unit) is responsible for processing all of the tasks that your computer needs to perform. When the CPU reaches its maximum processing capacity, it can cause your computer to run slow, freeze or crash.

There are several reasons why your computer may be experiencing high CPU usage. The most common culprits are too many programs running at once, outdated drivers, malware or virus infection, and background processes.

While there are several ways to fix high CPU usage, one simple trick is to use the Task Manager tool that comes built-in with Windows. Task Manager provides you with a glimpse into what's happening behind the scenes on your computer. It allows you to see which programs are using the most CPU and memory resources, making it much easier to identify what's causing the issue.

To access Task Manager, right-click on the taskbar and select "Task Manager" or simply press "Ctrl+Shift+Esc." Once you've opened Task Manager, click on the "Processes" tab to view all running processes. The list shows you all the programs and system processes currently running on your computer.

To identify which program is causing high CPU usage, click on the “CPU” column, which sorts the list by the highest CPU usage at the top. Look for any program that is using a high percentage of CPU resources, typically around 80-100%. That program is likely the culprit.

Once you have identified the program, you can either close it or uninstall it if it's not essential. If it's a system process or critical program, try restarting your computer to see if that helps alleviate the high CPU usage.

In some cases, a simple solution like closing a program or restarting your computer may not be enough to fix high CPU usage. In such instances, it may be best to seek help from a professional.

In conclusion, high CPU usage can cause your computer to run slow and inefficiently. However, by using the Task Manager tool, it’s simple to identify the program causing the high CPU usage and fix the issue. If you experience high CPU usage regularly, it's essential to perform regular system maintenance to keep your computer running smoothly.

Task Manager is a system monitor that provides information about the background running processes and applications. Unless the system starts to misbehave or freezes, we do not check these processes by opening Task Manager. However, if you face issues like:
 
- Unstable internet connection
 - Too many pop-ups
 - Slow PC performance
 - Continuous system freeze, etc., looking for a resource-hogging process is a must.

 
Now that you have opened Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift+ Esc and seeing RAVbg64.exe taking up to 60% of resources, what will you do?
 
I will either try to fix High CPU Usage or try to know if the file is legitimate or virus, right?
 
So, let’s know more about RAVBg64.exe and how to fix the High CPU Usage Caused by it without any further delay.
 
### What is RAVBg64.exe?
 
 RAVBg64.exe is a process related to Realtek High Definition Audio codecs. The process runs in the background, and it supports audio on PC. Disabling or terminating the process hampers audio on the system; however, there seems to be an issue if the process consumes enough CPU power. Hence, we need first to check the file location, update drivers, check system for malware, virus infection, and perform other cleaning operations.
 
For this, we suggest using Advanced System Optimizer – a powerful system tweaking tool that offers driver updater, system protector, disk checker, optimizer, junk file cleaner, and a lot of different features.
