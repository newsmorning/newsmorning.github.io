As an avid Apple user, I have always trusted their products for their reliability and functionality. However, when my iMac Intel 21.5 EMC 2389 began repeatedly crashing, I was left stumped. I tried every trick in the book, from restarting my computer to reinstalling the operating system, but nothing seemed to work.

After hours of troubleshooting, I was not only incredibly frustrated but also concerned about the loss of my important data. That’s when I decided to seek help from the experts. Through countless hours of research and online forums, I finally found the solution to my problem.

Here’s what fixed my iMac's constant crashing and what you can do if you’re experiencing the same problem:

**Step 1: Remove and clean the RAM sticks**

The Random Access Memory (RAM) in my iMac had accumulated a tremendous amount of dust and debris over time, which caused it to malfunction. To fix the problem, I removed the RAM sticks from my computer and cleaned them thoroughly with a soft-bristled brush.

**Step 2: Check for corrupt files**

Another reason for my iMac's continuous crashing was a corrupt file in my system. To check for any corrupt files, I downloaded a software program that scanned my system for errors and removed them.

**Step 3: Update the operating system**

An outdated operating system could also be the reason for your computer's constant crashing. Ensure that your software is up to date by checking in the system preferences for any available updates.

**Step 4: Reset SMC and PRAM**

Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) and Parameter Random Access Memory (PRAM) is known to help fix issues related to power, hardware, and startup on Macs. I followed the steps on Apple’s website to reset the SMC and PRAM for my iMac.

**Step 5: Seek professional help**

If all else fails and your iMac is still constantly crashing, reach out to Apple’s support team or take your device to an authorized repair center.

In conclusion, a constantly crashing iMac can hinder productivity and result in the loss of important data. However, with the steps mentioned above, you can easily fix the issue and get back to work in no time. Remember to take regular care of your iMac by keeping it clean and conducting software updates to prevent such problems.

## Chosen Solution
 Acting very erratic had to reinstall OS still problematic. I’ve been running blender on this computer a lot and it almost seems like it’s better with a fan running behind it after reinstall. But it is acting very bad. Sometimes it will say missing operating system. I got it from university repair store. They took out the DVD. And put a SDD  and a  hdd terabyte. It’s been working great until lately. I don’t know if this is logic or or what. I don’t think this has fans? Anybody have any ideas of what I could tackle to fix this …..when I run diagnostics it said the hard drives are fine. Everything is fine. Not. Lol
wallly

 Did you mean SSD? Is the OS installed there?
You’re running it pretty hot with Blender, so it might be power supply related, or temp cycling related. Maybe it has a fan… that died. Also, try swapping the memory boards just for fun, sometimes they get dirt or aren’t seated well. If you have two or more ram cards, take out one at a time.
