You Won't Believe What's Causing Your PS4 Slim to Keep Ejecting Discs - And It's Not What You Think!

If you're a gamer who owns a PS4 Slim, you may have encountered the frustrating issue where your console keeps ejecting discs for no apparent reason. You might have even tried some troubleshooting techniques like manually ejecting the disc, cleaning the eject button or looking for physical obstructions around the eject button. But what if we told you that the cause of the problem might not be what you think?

Many users have reported experiencing this problem, and it's so common that it has been nicknamed the "auto-eject bug." However, after some investigation, it turns out that the issue is not a bug in the system software, nor is it caused by a hardware malfunction.

So what, then, is causing your PS4 Slim to keep ejecting discs? The answer is that it's most likely due to static electricity buildup. Yes, you read that right—static electricity can mess with your console's eject button!

When you play games for extended periods of time, your hands can create a static charge from the friction between your fingers and the controller. This static charge can transfer to your PS4 Slim when you touch it, and when it reaches the eject button, it triggers the system to eject the disc.

This might sound far-fetched, but many PS4 Slim users have reported that the problem disappears when they ground themselves before touching the console. You can ground yourself by touching something metal like a doorknob or a radiator before touching the PS4 Slim.

If this solution doesn't work for you, then there are a few other things you can try. One is to turn off your console and unplug it from the power socket. Then, press and hold down the power button for 30 seconds to discharge any residual electrical charge. Plug it back in and turn it on again to see if the problem persists.

Another solution is to use a small piece of non-conductive material like thick paper or cardstock to cover the eject button so that you don't accidentally touch it. This might not be the most elegant solution, but it is easy and effective.

So, there you have it—the surprising truth behind your PS4 Slim's auto-eject issue. If you're experiencing this problem, don't fret. Try grounding yourself before touching the console or using a non-conductive material to cover the eject button. With these simple tricks, you'll be back to gaming in no time!

## Chosen Solution
 Hi,
Excuse my english, i’m a french guy.
After a shock on top, my PS4 Slim is keeping ejecting disc when this one was out. 
I try to dissassemble my ps4 to see what happened, if it was something broken inside. I saw nothing. 
So when the disc is out, the PS4 make the noise of ejecting a disc, maybe 3 times. And it stops. Then, i can’t insert a disc. I have to reset or restart to put a disc, which can be accepted.  (I put the disc until it stands on the slot, maybe 1/3 of the disc, then, after power on, the disc is “eaten”).  So, i can play, the PS4 read the disc. 
I try do relaunch the “power cycle”, several times. But, the problem is always there.
I read some description issues on forum, but no one was absolutely similar.
Maybe a sensor problem ? A gear problem ?
Thank you.
