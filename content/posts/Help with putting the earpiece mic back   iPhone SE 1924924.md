# You've Been Putting Your iPhone SE Earpiece Mic Wrong All These Years - Find Out The Easy Fix Now!

If youâ€™re an iPhone SE user, you're familiar with the earpiece speaker that also functions as a microphone. However, it may surprise you that you've been putting the earpiece mic wrong for all these years. The good news is that the fix is easy, and you can enjoy clear audio with each conversation. So, let's dive into some background information and the steps to correct your earpiece mic placement.

## Background Information

The iPhone SE is unique in the sense that it has an earpiece speaker that functions as a microphone. Unlike most smartphones, it does not have a separate microphone at the top of the phone. You might have noticed that when you make a call, you hold the phone upside down because that's where the speaker and the mic are located. However, it's not that straightforward when it comes to the earpiece mic.

The earpiece mic is located at the top of the phone, close to the front-facing camera. When you put the earpiece speaker to your ear, it's essential to ensure that the mic is facing your mouth, and not your ear. Unfortunately, many iPhone SE users put the speaker to their ears in the wrong direction, which results in poor audio quality.

## The Fix

Now that you know where the earpiece mic is located let's dive into the steps to correct its placement.

**Step 1: Flip The Phone Over**

To start, flip your iPhone SE over and put it on a flat surface. The earpiece speaker and mic are at the top of the phone.

**Step 2: Locate The Little Dots**

Locate the two little dots on the earpiece speaker. You will notice that one dot is more prominent than the other.

**Step 3: Remember Which Dot Is More Prominent**

The more prominent dot is your earpiece microphone, while the smaller dot is part of the noise-canceling feature. Remember which dot is more prominent because that's the one you want to point towards your mouth.

**Step 4: Put The Earpiece Speaker To Your Ear Correctly**

When making a call, put the earpiece speaker to your ear correctly, with the prominent dot pointing towards your mouth. This arrangement ensures that the mic picks up your voice, resulting in clear audio.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, many iPhone SE users are unaware that they've been putting their earpiece mic in the wrong direction. The good news is that the fix is easy, and with this knowledge, you can have clear audio with each conversation. You only need to remember which dot is more prominent, and you would be surprised at the difference it makes. So, the next time you make a phone call, put the earpiece speaker to your ear in the right direction, and enjoy crystal-clear sound.

## Chosen Solution
 So I repaired my iPhone SE after a cascade of unfortunate events including but not limited to:
-smashing the screen
-getting it replaced by a third party and them messing it up
-going back so they can replace it again
-finally breaking it AGAIN
-fixing it myself
SO now we're here...
My front facing mic on the phone is really difficult to put back in place. That's it.
I replaced the screen and I just can't get the dang mic thing back in the slot. It kinda just sit on top of this soft rubber piece and doesn't really  go into the slot. Whenever I using the front facing mic it doesn't intercept audio very well. It works, but Siri can't hear a word I say. Any tips/help is greatly appreciated!
side note: I'm dumb and broke something along the way and now my PC won't recognize the phone when I plug it in. I know all the other tips/tricks but I've tried them all. it's boiled down to a hardware problem (lightning port) or I factory reset/restore.
