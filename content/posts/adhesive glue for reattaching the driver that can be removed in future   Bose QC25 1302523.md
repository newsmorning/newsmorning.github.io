## Chosen Solution
 I found a fairly helpful tutorial on replacing a faulty driver on these headphones. The question comes down to adhesive.  What this guy used in his repair is not available in the US. It is a latex based adhesive, but I am not really sure how much the actual adhesive base matters here. I would like an adhesive that can be removed in the future with a little bit of heat (like say a hot hairdrier) in case I ever need to replace the drivers again.  The components are all fairly close together and it’s important that I can remove the driver in the future if I need to replace it again. I don’t want to damage any components or melt plastic to remove it. other features that would be appreciated but are not deal breakers:a bit of moisture resistance, won’t drip/run, comes in a small size, able to buy local rather than order online (I live in a large metro area, I can go to specialty stores if it’s fairly niche),  affordable (under $8 for a small quantity is ideal).I’ve been going through different glue products online, reading the technical specifications of them, but I really can’t find much useful info about removal. Most will just say “strong permananet bond” which really isn’t helpful.TLDR: Looking for adhesive/glue for reattaching the driver to the plastic on Bose QC25 headphones. I want to be able to remove it in the future if a future repair is needed, ideally with light heat (ie hairdrier) as to not melt or warp the plastic parts. .

 Hi @otterotter ,
I would use B-7000, That softens when heat applied. It is commonly used in mobile phone and tablet repairs.
Hope it helps!
