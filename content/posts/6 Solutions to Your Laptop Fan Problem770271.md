# Is Your Laptop Fan Driving You Crazy? Check Out These 6 Lifesaving Solutions Now!

If you're someone who works on a laptop for extended periods, you might have noticed that the fan noise can be extremely distracting and even annoying. Not only can it affect your productivity, but it can also make you feel exhausted after a long day's work. Fortunately, there are some simple yet effective solutions that you can employ to minimize fan noise and, in turn, improve your working experience. Here are six lifesaving solutions that you can try today:

## 1. Clean Your Laptop's Vents and Fans

One of the most common reasons for loud fan noise is clogged vents and fans. Over time, dust, pet hair, and other debris can accumulate in the vents, blocking the airflow and making the fan work harder than it needs to. To prevent this, you should clean your laptop's vents and fans regularly. You can do this by using a can of compressed air or a soft-bristled brush to gently remove the debris from the vents.

## 2. Use a Laptop Cooling Pad

A laptop cooling pad is a great investment if you're looking to reduce fan noise and keep your computer running smoothly. These pads work by providing extra airflow to the laptop's underside, preventing overheating and reducing the need for the fan to work overtime. Plus, they're straightforward to use and can be found at an affordable price.

## 3. Adjust Your Power Settings

Many laptops come with power settings that can be customized to suit your needs. By adjusting your power settings, you can reduce the strain on your laptop's processor and, in turn, lower the fan noise. Some laptops even have eco-mode settings that allow you to optimize your battery life while reducing fan noise.

## 4. Close Unnecessary Applications

Having multiple applications and programs running simultaneously can cause your laptop's processor to work harder than it needs to. This, in turn, can lead to increased fan noise. To avoid this, it's best to close any unnecessary applications and programs when not in use.

## 5. Invest in a Solid-State Drive (SSD)

A Solid-State Drive (SSD) is a type of data storage device that is widely considered to be faster and more reliable than a traditional hard drive. Not only does it speed up your laptop's performance, but it also generates less heat, which means your fan won't have to work as hard. Although SSDs may be more expensive than traditional hard drives, they're worth the investment in the long run.

## 6. Seek Professional Help

If you've tried all of the solutions mentioned above and still have issues with your laptop's fan noise, you should seek professional help. A qualified technician can diagnose and repair any issues that may be causing the fan to work overtime. Although this may be a bit more costly, it will save you from the frustration and inconvenience of dealing with a noisy fan.

In conclusion, a laptop fan that makes a lot of noise can be frustrating and distracting. However, with some simple maintenance tasks and adjustments, you can minimize fan noise and improve your working experience. Whether it's cleaning your laptop's vents, investing in a laptop cooling pad, adjusting your power settings, closing unnecessary applications, investing in an SSD or seeking professional help, there are numerous solutions available that you can try today!

It’s not unusual
for laptop fans to break down over time. And if ignored, the damage to your
computer can be catastrophic.
 
Fortunately,
there are steps you can take to improve or fix the problem outright.
 
In this post,
we’ll show you some of the ways you can get your laptop fan working like
normal.
 

 
## Fix
Noisy Fans
 
A noisy fan means
your laptop is being pushed to its limits. Usually by a program that’s taxing
on your onboard RAM.
 
That or maybe the
fan just needs some attention.
 
Unlike desktop
fans, which have more room to breathe, laptop fans are smaller. So they have to
make up for it by blowing harder.
 
Whatever the case
may be, rest assured that there are ways to remedy the situation. 
 
#### Lift
Up Your Laptop
 
Let’s start with
something basic. Elevating your laptop will give it room to circulate air much
more efficiently. This leaves your fan more room to work with.
 
Because most
laptops have fans facing the bottom, the exhaust panels are partially blocked.
This makes it hard for hot air to blow out.
 
So raise your
laptops up, give it room to breathe, and the noise should go away shortly.
 
#### Dust
Up the Fans
 
If the first tip
doesn’t do it, then the fans might need some cleaning. 
 
Dust buildup is
nothing new when it comes to overheating laptops. Unfortunately, laptops are
barely maintained, if at all.
 
So if a
considerable amount of noise is being produced, it’s possible the fan blades
are blocked.
 
Grab some
compressed air and blow some air right into the fans. Of course, it would be
better if you can remove the back panel. This would ensure that the dust is
blown out of the laptop and you’re not driving dust further into the unit.
 
While you’re at
it, consider cleaning the other internal components.
 
Note: Not all laptop parts can
be removed. So don’t forcibly remove these sections.
 
After the dust is
removed, put the laptop back together and see if the fans are still making any
noise.
 
#### Plug
In a Laptop Cooler
 
These gadgets
provide additional air circulation that alleviates some of the pressure put on
built-in laptop fans.
 
They’re
inexpensive and detachable so you don’t have to carry them around when you
don’t want to.
 
## Fans
Under Stress
 
It’s normal for
fans to run as soon as it’s booted up. But when fans throttle at full speed
bringing it to its limit, you may have a problem.
 
Here are a few
steps you could take.
 
#### Close
Some Programs
 
The average
person would normally run two or three programs at a given time. And for the
most part, that’s fine.
 
But it’s not the
case for power users. They would often run web browsers, MS Office
applications, photo or video editing software, and stream media content on top
of it.
 
This causes fans
to work extra harder to dissipate all the heat the computer’s creating.
 
Some laptops are
not designed to handle a heavy workload. So it’s better to shut down some
applications so your fans don’t throttle as much. 
 
You can use
Windows Task Manager to determine which programs are draining your RAM and CPU.
 
To open Task
Manager, right-click on the Start icon
and select Task Manager from the
list of programs.
 
#### Remove
Malware
 
But what if
you’re barely running applications? Why would your fans run at full strength?
 
Well, in some
cases, malware is to blame for your fans erratic behavior.
 
If you suspect
that your laptop has been infected, you need to run your antivirus program. If
you don’t have one, there are a lot of free software online that you could
download and install.
 
You can also use
Task Manager to find programs that are running in the background. If there are
unfamiliar programs in the background, you can force these tasks to stop
running.
 
But be careful:
 
Some tasks are
integral to running Windows normally. And despite having unclear names, they
are legitimate applications. If unsure, you can perform a Google search for
additional information.
 
#### Download Software
 
There is
third-party software you can download that will regulate your fan usage. But be
warned: slowing down your fan speed will cause your laptop to overheat if
you’re not careful.
 
So we only
recommend this method if you know what you’re doing.
 
SpeedFan is one of the many software that helps monitor fan speeds.
 
Always do your
research before installing a third-party software solution.
