If you are a Samsung Galaxy Tab owner, you might have encountered a situation where the charger gets stuck inside the device. This can be a frustrating experience, especially if you don't know how to get it out. While this may seem like a serious problem, it's actually a common issue faced by many people.

If your charger gets stuck inside your Samsung Galaxy Tab, there's no need to panic. There are a few steps that you can take to remove the charger from your device without causing any damage or harm. All you will need is a few basic tools that you might already have at home.

Step 1: Turn off the device
The first thing you need to do is turn off your Samsung Galaxy Tab. This will ensure that no power is running through the device and reduce the risk of any electrical damage.

Step 2: Take a wooden toothpick
Next, take a wooden toothpick and gently insert it into the charging port. Make sure that the toothpick is wooden and not metal as metal can damage the charging port.

Step 3: Pry the charger out
Once you have inserted the toothpick, gently pry the charger out. You can do this by twisting the toothpick and pulling it outwards. Be gentle as you don't want to cause any damage to the device.

Step 4: Check for damage
After you have removed the charger, check the charging port for any damage. If there is any visible damage, it's best to take your device to a professional for repair.

Step 5: Clean the charging port
Lastly, clean the charging port with a small brush or a toothbrush. This will help remove any debris or dirt that might have been stuck inside the port.

In conclusion, getting your charger stuck inside your Samsung Galaxy Tab can be a frustrating experience, but there's no need to stress out. With just a few simple steps, you can easily remove the charger from your device without causing any damage. So, go ahead and try these steps out the next time you face this dilemma.

## Chosen Solution
 so my charger got stuck in the tablet and I tried to pull it out and now only the metal part is in the tablet and because of that I can't charge it .
please help

 Hey there!
A couple simple options that can probably get that out would probably be some hot glue (if you're careful) in the slot to stick to the metal piece that's stuck and pull it out when it cools.
Otherwise if you're good with fine pointed tweezers or possibly a safety pin to push on the latch that locks the connector into the tablet, you may be able to get it out with patience
