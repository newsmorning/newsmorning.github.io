# Emergency! Aeg Freezer Temperature is Stuck at 0-2 and No Cooling Resulting in Spoiled Food - Find Out How to Fix It Now!

If you are facing the problem of a stuck freezer temperature at 0-2 degrees and no cooling, then you are in an emergency situation. Spoiled food can cause severe health issues and can also lead to a waste of your valuable money. It is essential to fix the issue as soon as possible to avoid further damage.

Here are some steps that you can take to fix the Aeg freezer temperature issue:

## Check the Power Supply

The first and foremost step is to check whether the freezer is receiving the appropriate power supply or not. Make sure that the plug is correctly inserted into the power outlet, and the power switch is turned on. If you find any problem, then try to solve it by pressing or unplugging the freezer and plug it in again.

## Check the Temperature Setting

Another important step is to check the temperature setting of the Aeg freezer. Make sure that the temperature setting is appropriate and not set too high, causing the freezer to get stuck at 0-2 degrees. You can adjust the temperature setting according to the manual instructions.

## Check the Condenser Coils

The condenser coils play a vital role in the cooling process of the freezer. If the coils are covered with dust or dirt, then it becomes difficult for the freezer to cool the food. Make sure to clean the condenser coils regularly to avoid any further issues.

## Check the Refrigerant

The refrigerant is responsible for cooling the freezer. If the refrigerant is not enough or leaking, then it can lead to the spoiled food. You can check the level of the refrigerant and try to refill or replace it according to the manual instructions.

## Call the Expert

If you have tried all the above steps and still facing the same problem, then it is best to call the expert. The expert will check the freezer thoroughly and identify the root cause of the problem. They will also provide you with the best solution and repair the issue as soon as possible.

In conclusion, facing the Aeg freezer temperature stuck at 0-2 degrees issue can be frustrating and can lead to spoiled food. It is essential to take the above steps immediately to avoid any severe consequences. Always remember to read the manual instruction carefully and take care of your freezer regularly.


## Chosen Solution
 Cause 1
Condenser Coils are Dirty
If the condenser coils are located within the freezer walls, the coils do not require cleaning. However, if the condenser coils can be readily accessed from behind or under the unit, you should clean them every 6-12 months. If the condenser coils are dirty, they won’t be able to dissipate heat effectively, greatly reducing the cooling capacity of the freezer. If the condenser coils are dirty or have not been cleaned in a while, clean them.
Cause 2
Evaporator Fan Motor
The evaporator fan motor draws air over the evaporator coils and circulates it throughout the freezer. If the evaporator fan motor is not working, the freezer will not cool. On most refrigerators, the fan motor will not run when the door is open. To check the evaporator fan motor, open the freezer door and then manually activate the freezer door switch. If the door switch is activated, but the evaporator fan motor won’t run, replace the evaporator fan motor.
Parts
Cause 3
Start Relay
The start relay provides power to the compressor. If the start relay isn’t working properly, the compressor may run intermittently or may not run at all. If the compressor won’t run, the freezer will not cool. To determine if the start relay is defective, unplug the freezer and remove the start relay from the compressor. Use a multimeter to test the start relay for continuity between the start and run terminals. If the start relay does not have continuity, or if it smells burnt, replace it.

 Add coolant or contact the manufacturer

 I had this problem just now. I opened the panels inside the freezer. This coils were frosted up. Took a hairdryer and warmed up the ice. Fridge side is cooling now.
