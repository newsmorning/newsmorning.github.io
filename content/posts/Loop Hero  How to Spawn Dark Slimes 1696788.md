# Unleash the Dark Side: Discover the Ultimate Trick to Spawn Dreaded Dark Slimes in Loop Hero!

Loop Hero is a recently launched indie game that has captured the hearts of many players with its unique mix of RPG and rogue-like elements. The game is set in a fantasy world being ravaged by an all-consuming Lich, and the player is tasked with building a looped path for the hero to travel on in order to defeat the enemies and gather resources to rebuild their world.

One of the more challenging enemies the player will face are the dark slimes, which are powerful monsters that spawn after certain conditions are met, making them a formidable foe for any player. However, with a bit of strategic placement, players can learn how to spawn these dreaded creatures to gain valuable resources and experience. In this article, we'll explore the ultimate trick to unleash the dark side and spawn these elusive monsters.

# The Basics of Dark Slimes

Before we dive into the trick of spawning dark slimes, let's take a closer look at what they are and what makes them so challenging. Dark slimes are a unique type of enemy that only spawn under specific conditions. They're stronger than regular slimes and deal more damage, but they also have higher health and yield better rewards, making them a valuable enemy to farm. 

To spawn a dark slime, players must battle regular slimes within the range of a beacon. Beacons are special items that can be placed on the path the hero follows, and any monsters that are defeated within their range will have a chance to spawn a dark slime. This chance increases with each slime defeated under the beacon.

# The Ultimate Trick

Now for the exciting part - the ultimate trick to spawn dark slimes! The key to getting dark slimes to spawn is to create an enclosed loop using beacons. When a loop is created, it ensures that any monsters defeated within the enclosed space are within range of the beacons, increasing the chances of spawning a dark slime. This trick works best with a loop that's at least three tiles wide.

Here's how to do it:

1. Start by placing a beacon on an empty tile, then build a path around it to create an enclosed shape.

2. Add a second beacon, making sure it's within range of the first.

3. Continue building the path, making sure to keep the beacons within range of each other. 

4. Once the loop is complete, start battling the regular slimes within the enclosed space.

5. With each slain slime, the chances of a dark slime spawning increase.

6. Keep battling the regular slimes until a dark slime appears, then defeat it to gain valuable rewards.

# Final Thoughts

Loop Hero's dark slimes are tough enemies that require skill and strategy to defeat, but following this ultimate trick will help you spawn them regularly and farm them for valuable resources. Remember that it's important to create an enclosed loop using beacons to increase the chances of spawning a dark slime. 

With this knowledge, you'll be able to unleash the dark side and take on any enemy that comes your way in Loop Hero!
