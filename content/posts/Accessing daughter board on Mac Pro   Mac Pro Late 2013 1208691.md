# You Won't Believe How Easy It Is to Access the Hidden Daughter Board on Your Mac Pro Late 2013!

If you're an owner of a Mac Pro Late 2013, then you may be pleasantly surprised to know that accessing the hidden daughter board inside your computer is an incredibly easy process. The daughter board, also known as the I/O board, is responsible for managing various ports and hardware components, including USB, Thunderbolt, and HDMI.

Many Mac Pro Late 2013 owners are unaware that this board even exists, let alone that it can be accessed with relative ease. While it's not something you would need to access frequently, it's important to know how to do so if ever the need arises.

Here's how you can access the hidden daughter board on your Mac Pro Late 2013.

## Step 1: Shut Down Your Mac Pro

Before you begin performing any sort of maintenance on your Mac Pro, it's important to ensure that the system is completely shut down. You don't want to risk any damage to sensitive components by attempting to access them while the computer is powered on.

## Step 2: Position Your Mac Pro Correctly

Once your Mac Pro is shut down, you'll need to position it correctly to access the daughter board. Turn your Mac Pro over so that it's resting on its side, with the Apple logo facing upwards. You may want to place a soft towel or cloth underneath the computer to protect its exterior.

## Step 3: Remove the Cover

Using a screwdriver or another suitable tool, remove the two screws located on the bottom of your Mac Pro. These screws help to secure the computer's cover in place.

Gently slide the cover towards the top of the unit to release it from the metal clips that are holding it in place. Be careful not to pull too hard or apply too much pressure, as this may damage the cover or other components inside your Mac Pro.

## Step 4: Locate the Daughter Board

Once the cover is removed, you'll be able to see the daughter board. This rectangular board is located near the bottom of the Mac Pro, and is secured in place with a screw on each side. You may need to use a flashlight or other light source to get a better view of the board and surrounding components.

## Step 5: Remove the Daughter Board

To remove the daughter board, simply unscrew the two screws that are holding it in place. Once these screws are removed, you should be able to gently lift the board out of its socket.

## Step 6: Reassembly

Once you have accessed the daughter board, you can either perform any necessary maintenance or simply put everything back together. To reassemble your Mac Pro, follow these steps:

- Gently push the daughter board back into its socket and secure it in place with the two screws.
- Slide the cover back into position and press down to secure it to the metal clips.
- Reattach the two screws on the bottom of the unit.

Congratulations! You have successfully accessed the hidden daughter board on your Mac Pro Late 2013. While it's not something you're likely to need to do often, knowing how to do so can be incredibly helpful in case of any issues or problems.

Hi Dan,
I have a Mac Pro 2013 that I want to do a clean install on the but the Mac is EFI locked.
I have read that the only way to get the code is through Apple and you have to have the receipt which I do not have.
I've been in touch with a guy who can create a Matt card but I need to access the round PCB (daughter board) as there is a small socket which will house the Matt card. The Matt card will somehow bypass the EFI code. I've managed to access the board by following steps 1 and 2 and 10 and 11, it says that the two screws that are on top are t7 but they're actually t10.

Getting to the daughter board was simple and straight forward.

 Other than replacing the EFI chip there is no means to bypass the EFI. The Matt board leverages the diagnostic port the laptops have. The Mac Pro uses a very different design (slot in middle) as far as I know there is no EFI override tool. Even still, if the original owner also iCloud locked your system you'll have problems with application access from the Apple Store.
