# Is Your iPhone 5 Failing You? Cell Service Work for Few Seconds After Startup?

If you own an iPhone 5, you might have experienced an odd issue with your cell service. After startup, your phone's cell service may work for a few seconds before disappearing completely. This issue can be frustrating, but it is not uncommon. In this article, we will try to identify the issue and provide you with some troubleshooting steps.

## Possible Causes

There are several reasons why this issue may be happening. Here are some potential causes:

1. **Carrier issues**: Your carrier may be experiencing service outages or maintenance that is impacting your phone's service.
2. **SIM card issues**: Your SIM card may be damaged, outdated or unsupported by your carrier.
3. **Software issues**: Your iPhone's software might have some glitches that are impacting your cell service.
4. **Hardware issues**: Your iPhone's hardware, specifically its antenna or modem, may be damaged, which is causing the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Restart Your Device**: Restarting your iPhone can solve software-related issues. Hold the power button and swipe the slider to shut down your device. Once your phone is shut down, press and hold the power button until you see the Apple logo appear. Once it has turned on, check if your cell service is working properly.
2. **Check Your Carrier**: Contact your carrier and ask if there are any known issues in your area. If there are, wait for them to fix the issues before trying to troubleshoot your device further.
3. **Reset Network Settings**: Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will erase all of your network settings, including Wi-Fi passwords, and then reboots your device. Check if your cell service works after this.
4. **Check SIM Card**: If you suspect that your SIM card is not working properly, take it out of your phone and try cleaning it with a soft, microfiber cloth. Once you've cleaned it, power off your device, insert the SIM card and then power it back on.
5. **Restore Device**: If none of these steps work, try restoring your device as new. This means that the device will return to its original factory settings, and you will lose all your data. To do this, connect your iPhone to your computer, open iTunes, and choose the 'Restore iPhone' option. Follow the prompts, and then set up your device as new.

## Conclusion

If your iPhone 5's cell service is working only for a few seconds after startup, there might be a few reasons behind this. This issue can be resolved by trying a few troubleshooting steps. If none of these steps work, you can take your iPhone to the Apple Store, and they can help you fix the issue.

## Chosen Solution
 Hello,
Not sure if anyone is paying attention to iPhone 5's anymore, but I have an interesting issue I would like to resolve.  I have been trying to repair an iPhone 5, and have gotten it almost fully working.  The issue is, the phone shows a cellular connection (ATT), but calls and data only work for a short period of time, then I get the call failed error even though the phone still shows a good connection.  I have tried changing the cellular antenna, as well as taking the entire lightning port/speaker setup on the bottom from a working phone and subbing it in, to no avail.  If I turn cell data/LTE off and on, I can sometimes get it to work, but turning the phone off and on always gives me about 5 minutes of connection.
Any ideas?
Thanks!

 I would rule out software first and check to make sure the phone is not blacklisted.
