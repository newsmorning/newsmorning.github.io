subtitle: A cautionary tale about using non-certified chargers

Article:

It was just an ordinary day when my friend Jane noticed that her charger tip had broken off inside her iPad Pro 11. At first, she thought it wouldn't be a big deal. After all, she had the same thing happen with her phone once and was able to extract the tip with some tweezers. However, this time it was different. No matter what she tried, the piece just wouldn't come out.

At first, Jane wasn't too worried. She assumed that the worst-case scenario would be that she'd have to replace the charging port on her tablet. But as time went on, Jane began to realize the true extent of the damage that had been done.

Her iPad Pro 11 had been rendered practically useless.

Not only was the charging port damaged, but the piece that had broken off inside was causing even more problems. The port was partially torn, and the battery was draining quickly. Even worse, the iPad was freezing and shutting off unexpectedly. Jane knew something had to be done.

So, what went wrong? Why did Jane's charger tip break off in the first place? The answer is simple â€“ she was using a non-certified charger.

The risks of using non-certified chargers

In an effort to save a few dollars, Jane had purchased a cheap, generic charger from a third-party seller. She had assumed that all chargers were created equal, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The charger she purchased was not only low quality, but it was also not certified by Apple.

Using a non-certified charger not only puts your device at risk, but it can also be dangerous. These chargers don't go through the same rigorous testing as certified ones, which means they can overheat, cause electrical shorts, and even start fires.

The bottom line is that non-certified chargers can cause irreparable damage to your devices. In Jane's case, the charger tip breaking off was just the beginning. The damage had spread, and her iPad Pro 11 couldn't be fixed.

What can you do to protect your devices?

It's essential to use certified chargers for your electronic devices. While they may be more expensive, they're worth the investment. Certified chargers are guaranteed to meet strict safety standards and won't damage your devices.

However, it's important to note that not all certified chargers are created equal. It's best to purchase chargers directly from the manufacturer or from certified resellers. Avoid purchasing chargers from third-party sellers, as you can never be sure of the quality or legitimacy of their products.

In conclusion,

Jane's story should serve as a cautionary tale for all of us. Using non-certified chargers may save us a few dollars, but it can end up costing us much more in the long run. If you want to protect your electronic devices, invest in certified chargers, and avoid the risks associated with non-certified ones. Remember, prevention is always better than a cure.
