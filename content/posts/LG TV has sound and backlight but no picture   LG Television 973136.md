Is Your LG TV Playing Tricks On You? See How to Fix the No Picture Issue with Sound and Backlight!

LG is a renowned name in the world of electronics, and LG TVs are among the most popular television brands on the market today. However, even the high-quality televisions are not immune to technical glitches. One of the common problems LG TV owners face is the no picture issue with sound and backlight. In this article, we'll go through some troubleshooting tips that you can follow to fix this issue.

Check the Power Source

Sometimes, all it takes to fix the no picture issue with sound and backlight on your LG TV is to check the power source. Ensure that your LG TV is properly plugged in and that the power source is active. Also, check if the power cord is frayed or broken as this could cause voltage fluctuations, leading to the problem.

Reset Your LG TV

If there are no issues with the power source, resetting your LG TV could help fix the problem. To do this, follow these simple steps:

1. Turn off your LG TV and unplug it from the power source.

2. Wait for at least 5 minutes.

3. Plug the TV back into the power source and turn it on.

This simple process could fix the no picture issue with sound and backlight problem in some cases.

Check the Input Source

If you're not getting any picture on your LG TV, the issue could be with the input source. Change the input source on your TV to ensure that the problem is not from your external device like a set-top box or gaming console. Check the TV's manual to know-how.

Update Your LG TV's Firmware

Another reason for the no picture issue with sound and backlight on your LG TV could be due to the outdated firmware. Most TV manufacturers release firmware updates to fix bugs and improve the overall performance of their TVs. If you haven't updated your LG TV's firmware in a while, it's worth checking if there is a new version available.

To update your LG TV's firmware, follow these steps:

1. Go to LG's website and navigate to the support section.

2. Download the latest firmware update for your TV model.

3. Save the firmware file in a USB drive and plug it into your TV.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to update your LG TV's firmware.

Conclusion

The no picture issue with sound and backlight problem on your LG TV can be frustrating, but it's not a major issue. By following these simple troubleshooting tips, you can fix the issue and enjoy your LG TV's excellent viewing experience again. However, if you've tried all these tips and the problem persists, you may want to seek professional help or contact LG's customer support.

## Chosen Solution
 LG TV 43uk6500AUA has sound and backlight but no picture. I have replaced the two boards visible when you take the back of the TV off, still the same issue. I have tried the power on off for periods of time and still nothing, not sure what else can be replaced on this TV any suggestions?

 Hi @riley123 ,
Here’s the service manual for the TV.
Go to p.28 to view the no video/normal audio troubleshooting flowchart.
You said that you have replaced the two boards which I assume means the power board and the mainboard.
Looking online at images of the mainboard it appears that the tcon is part of the mainboard and not a separate board as in some other brands of TV.
If this is the case and since you have replaced the mainboard (seen as Tcon/mainboard in the flowchart) then the flowchart says to replace the module, which is their term for the LCD panel.

 Hey Riley. My LG has this problem but I wanted to see if you fixed yours. I didn’t buy the replacement boards yet in case it’s the LCD panel. Does anyone know how to troubleshoot to see if it’s that? I have the repair manual but it doesn’t have a way to test if it’s the module or boards that are faulty.
