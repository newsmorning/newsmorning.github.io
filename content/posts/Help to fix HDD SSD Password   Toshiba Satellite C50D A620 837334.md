## Chosen Solution
 Hi. There i just get this problem 5 hour ago,
i am using my computer with windows 10, while i am using it, it hang for some seconds
and show a blue screen but i didn't read the error message, so the system restart as blue screen normally use to do, when it restart it shows me no boot or hard disk detected, i check the hard disk and put it back and power on the system back, it started showing me HDD/SDD Password, now if i press esc key it will show a blank screen with an underscore not blinking and that's how the computer will stay until i turn off the system, if i try to press F9 or F2 or F12 nothing will happen, so i remove the hard drive and insert it in external enclosure the hard drive won't spin.
Please i need a clue.

 If the hard drive is not showing up when using an enclosure and asking you for a password when booting up, it sounds like you have some type of hard drive encryption software installed.  The only way to remove the encryption software is to type in the password you used to setup the encryption, get to a Windows desktop, and remove the encryption. If you can't remember your encryption password then it appears your data is locked forever.
