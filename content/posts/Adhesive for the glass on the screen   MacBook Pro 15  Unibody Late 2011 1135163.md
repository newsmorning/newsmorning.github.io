## Chosen Solution
 Hi, I had to replace the glass cover as the old one had cracked.
The only problem is that the new perspex/glass cover had only double sided sticky tape on it to hold it onto the metal behind it and is coming off every time I open/close my mac even after removing the old glue from the metal section
I was wondering if there is any sort of adhesive strips I could get to attach it properly or even double sided sticky foam but what thickness would you recommend..
I've searched online and I can't find any strips to buy locally (I live in the UK) so I would be happy using the foam but I'm unsure as to the thickness.. :S
Many thanks!!

 Before buying another kind of tape try heating up the glass and with a cloth (so you don't burn your fingers) go around pushing it agains the frame. Don't heat it too much so you don't melt the rubber gasket

 I use Red tape for repairs like this. Found on eBay just search for "red repair tape" 8 or 10mm should work for you
