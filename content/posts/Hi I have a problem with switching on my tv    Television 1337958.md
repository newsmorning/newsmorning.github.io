For weeks, I had been dealing with the problem of my TV switching on repeatedly. Every time I go to bed and turn my TV off, it switches back on after a few minutes. This not only disrupts my sleep but also wastes energy. I was completely clueless about what was causing this issue, and I was considering calling a technician to look into it. However, to my surprise, the solution to my problem turned out to be incredibly simple.

After doing some research online, I came across a forum post that suggested something that I never thought of before - checking if the sleep timer was enabled. The sleep timer is a feature that allows the TV to automatically turn off after a specified period. This feature is generally used when you want to watch TV before bed and then have it turn off automatically. Therefore, if the sleep timer is on, your TV will switch back on every time it's turned off.

I quickly dug into my TV's settings and checked the sleep timer. And voila! That was the issue - the sleep timer was on for two hours. So every time I turned my TV off, it would automatically turn back on after two hours, causing me to lose my sleep.

Disabling the sleep timer was a breeze. I went into my TV's settings, found the sleep timer option and turned it off. Since then, my TV has not switched on in the middle of the night, and my sleep has been undisturbed.

If you're having the same issue, you must check the sleep timer first before calling in a technician. It's a simple fix that can save you money and time. However, if the sleep timer is not the problem, then there may be some other underlying issue that needs further investigation.

In conclusion, a simple solution that I never even thought of before solved my frustrating problem with my TV switching on repeatedly. Checking the sleep timer setting is essential when dealing with issues like this. It goes to show how important it is to research and troubleshoot before jumping to conclusions and calling in a technician. So if you're facing the same issue, check your sleep timer setting and save yourself some frustration and money!

 why is my Samsung tv model cs-21z58ml,when I plug it in the socket the standby Led yellow light flashes once for a second then goes off?what seems to be the problem?help

 @jymo single flash/blink is usually related to a bad power board. Remove the back off of your TV and take a look at all off your boards. Looks for obvious damaged components like leaking, domed caps etc. Post some images of your boards with your question so we can see what you see.
