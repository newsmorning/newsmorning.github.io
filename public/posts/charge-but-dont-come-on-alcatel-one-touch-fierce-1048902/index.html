Have you ever experienced a situation where your phone suddenly stopped working and refused to turn on? If your answer is yes, then you are not alone. Many people face this issue with their Alcatel One Touch Fierce, and it can be quite frustrating, especially if you have important information stored on your device.\nHowever, don’t panic, as there is a surprising solution that you may not have known about. Before you rush to the service center or start looking for a new phone, try the following tips to get your Alcatel One Touch Fierce up and running again.\nCheck the Battery\nThe first thing to ensure is that your phone has enough battery charge to turn on. If your phone battery is completely drained, then it won’t turn on at all. So, try charging the device for a few hours using the original charger that came with the phone. Many times, users forget to use the charger included in the box and instead use other chargers that may not be compatible with their device. This, in turn, could lead to battery damage, causing the phone not to turn on.\nTry a Hard Reset\nA hard reset is another solution that you can try. This process will restore your device to the original factory settings and could solve the software issues that might be causing your phone not to turn on. To perform a hard reset, you will need to follow these steps:\nPress and hold the power button and volume up button simultaneously for a few seconds.\nOnce the phone vibrates, release the power button but keep holding the volume up button.\nThe phone will reboot and display the Alcatel logo. Release the volume up button after the logo appears.\nFinally, you will see the Android System Recovery menu. From here, you can navigate using the volume buttons and select the ‘wipe data/factory reset’ option.\nConfirm the selection and wait for the process to complete.\nNote: Performing a hard reset will erase all the data on your phone, so ensure that you have a backup of your important information.\nContact Technical Support\nIf the above solutions do not solve your problem, then it means that there is something more severe that is preventing your Alcatel One Touch Fierce from turning on. In such cases, you should contact the Alcatel technical support team for assistance. They will guide you through a range of troubleshooting methods specific to your device and even recommend replacement options if required.\nIn conclusion, if you own an Alcatel One Touch Fierce smartphone that won’t turn on, don’t panic. The above solutions will help you troubleshoot the problem and restore the phone’s functionality. However, if these steps do not work, it is best to seek the assistance of a specialist before making any hasty decisions. By following these steps and keeping your phone in good condition, you can enjoy your device for years to come.\nChosen Solution my phone comes on to let me know how much battery but wont come completely on\nI would hold down the power button for 20-30 seconds first. If that does not work try using the reset method. Push and hold the Volume Up and Power Key at the same time, when the phone vibrate’s release the Power Button and Volume Up. Are you getting a blinking white light at all on the phone?\n","wordCount":"591","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Willie Shotwell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/charge-but-dont-come-on-alcatel-one-touch-fierce-1048902/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Don't Panic If Your Alcatel One Touch Fierce Won't Turn On - The Surprising Solution You Never Knew!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 8, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;591 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Willie Shotwell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chosen-solution>Chosen Solution</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Don&rsquo;t Panic If Your Alcatel One Touch Fierce Won&rsquo;t Turn On - The Surprising Solution You Never Knew!</p><p>Do you own an Alcatel One Touch Fierce smartphone?
