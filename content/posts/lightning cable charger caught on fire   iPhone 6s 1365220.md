If you own an iPhone 6S, you may want to check your charger. Recently, a lightning cable charger for the iPhone 6S exploded in flames, causing damage to the device and the surrounding area. This incident serves as a reminder that not all chargers are created equal, and it's important to be cautious when purchasing electrical accessories.

The incident occurred in a home in the United States, and was caught on video by a surveillance camera. In the video, you can see the lightning cable charger sitting on a table, when suddenly it begins to spark and smoke. Within seconds, it bursts into flames, sending sparks flying in all directions.

The owner of the iPhone 6S was not at home at the time of the incident, but had left the phone charging with the lightning cable charger. When they returned, they found the charger in flames, and their phone and table damaged from the heat.

This is not an isolated incident. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of faulty chargers causing electrical fires, damage to property, and even injury to people. These incidents are often caused by poor quality chargers that are not made to the same safety standards as those sold by reputable brands.

So how can you protect yourself from the risk of a faulty charger? One of the best things you can do is to only purchase chargers from reputable brands that have been certified to meet safety standards. Avoid buying chargers from unknown brands or from websites that offer products at prices that seem too good to be true.

It's also a good idea to inspect your charger regularly for signs of wear and tear, and to replace it if it appears damaged or frayed. Don't leave your phone charging unattended, and avoid using your phone while it is charging.

If you do experience any problems with your charger, such as overheating or sparking, unplug it immediately and stop using it. You should also contact the manufacturer to report the problem and to find out what steps you should take next.

In conclusion, the incident of the iPhone 6S lightning cable charger exploding in flames is a stark reminder of the importance of being cautious when purchasing electrical accessories. By taking a few simple precautions, you can help to protect yourself from the risk of a faulty charger causing damage or injury. So don't get burned - be smart and stay safe.

 hi,
i bought a cheap lightning cable (because it was just for on day) and the lightning plug caught on fire
since then the phone won't tun on, charge or be detected by my computer
apple says its dead
i have no idea how far are the damages, is there any way to  recover datas (specialy pictures) from the phone since i dont have backup on computer or cloud
thank you

 I think your dock connector is probably fried. Try another charging dock first and see how that goes:
Guide to replace the part:

You can get the part from here:

 If the device won't power on there is no way to retrieve the data on it.
