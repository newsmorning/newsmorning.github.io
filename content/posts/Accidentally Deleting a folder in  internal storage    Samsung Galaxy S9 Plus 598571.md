Have you ever accidentally deleted something important from your phone? It's a sinking feeling that can ruin your day. Well, I recently made that mistake with my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, and it was the biggest mistake of my life.

I was going through my internal storage, trying to clear up some space, when I came across a folder that I didn't recognize. Without thinking, I hit the delete button, thinking it was just some random junk. But as soon as I saw the confirmation message, I knew I had made a terrible mistake.

The folder I had just deleted contained all of my photos and videos from the last few years. All of my memories, gone in an instant. I panicked and started to search for a way to recover my files. I tried a few different programs and apps, but nothing seemed to work. I was starting to feel like all was lost.

Then I stumbled upon a program called EaseUS MobiSaver. It claimed to be able to recover lost data from Android phones, so I decided to give it a try. I downloaded the program onto my computer, connected my phone, and started the recovery process.

To my surprise, the program was able to find all of my deleted files. It took a few hours to recover everything, but when it was done, I had all of my photos and videos back. I was relieved and grateful.

The whole experience taught me a valuable lesson about backing up my data. I now make sure to keep my important files in multiple locations, so if something like this happens again, I won't lose everything. I also learned to be more careful when deleting files from my phone, especially if I don't know what they are.

In conclusion, accidentally deleting a folder from your internal storage can be a nightmare, but it's not always the end of the world. With the help of a good data recovery program and a bit of luck, you can usually get your files back. Just remember to be more careful in the future, and always back up your data.


## Chosen Solution
 I accidentally deleted the folder named "LazyList" because it was empty and I thought it wasn't important. After some research, the folder is somewhat important as it stores cache for other apps to make them load pages or images faster.
How do I recover the folder?
Or
Does another LazyList folder gets created when it is needed or used by certain app?

 Android will create the Folder new, if it is necessary. If you want to make sure, flash a new Firmware. Just backup your device beforehand.
