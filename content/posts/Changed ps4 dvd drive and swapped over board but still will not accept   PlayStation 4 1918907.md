# Gamers Beware: How Changing Your PS4 DVD Drive Could End in Disaster!

Are you a gamer who has a PlayStation 4 at home? Are you considering replacing your PS4’s DVD drive with a new one? If so, you might want to hold off on your plans for a little while.

Changing your PS4 DVD drive may seem like a simple enough task, but it could have disastrous consequences. Let’s take a closer look at why that is.

Firstly, it’s essential to understand that the PS4 DVD drive is an integral component of the console. It’s responsible for reading and playing game discs and also serves as the front panel for the device’s power button. The replacement of the DVD drive comes with its share of complexities as it involves external disassembly of the console.

Unless you have a technical background in electronics, you may not fully understand the intricacies within your console. Any mistake made during the installation of a new DVD drive could end up having devastating results. If you’re considering the replacement of your PS4’s DVD drive, it’s strongly recommended that you take it to a professional repair technician. 

Secondly, changing your PS4 DVD drive could also lead to the potential voiding of your console's warranty. Sony maintains that PS4 owners should never attempt to make any repairs or upgrades to their console, as doing so could result in loss of warranty coverage.

Loss of warranty is a significant concern, as it means that you may end up spending an even greater amount than you may have anticipated over time. If something goes wrong, you could be left with a broken console, paying for the cost of the repair out of your pocket. Moreover, the voiding would also make your PS4 ineligible for future hardware or software support from Sony.

Thirdly, although it may seem like a cost-effective or budget-friendly option to replace your PS4’s DVD drive, it could end up costing you more in the long run. Any incorrectly executed upgrade or repair could lead to more damage on your device, costing you even more money to get it fixed or replaced. You may also experience issues with the newly installed drive while accessing game discs, which could expose you to constant troubleshooting.

In conclusion, changing your PS4 DVD drive is not a task to be taken lightly. While it may appear to be a tempting or cost-efficient DIY option, it is important to understand that the procedure is fraught with numerous risks, especially considering it could compromise your warranty. If you must replace your DVD drive, ensure you approach a skilled technician with the right experience and equipment to execute an installation in a way that won't damage your device. 

Remember, Sony provides official repair services from skilled and experienced professionals, so always consider this option first before any attempt at a DIY replacement. Play safe and don't let a simple task turn expensive!

## Chosen Solution
 So I changed a ps4 dvd drive as it wouldn't eject or accept disks.  its the correct drive with same board name (bdp-020) but when I swap over the board the new drive will act just like my old drive, not accepting disks. It reads disks fine with the baord that came along with it( but wont load games as the board isn't matched.
This is the second PS4 I've come across with this same problem.
I guess its just a faulty board and theres not much I can do to fix it, or can I try to change components in the daughter board?

 you would need both specialized hardware and software to rewrite the serials on the board. this becomes very expensive, and unless youre doing it regularily, it is not usually worth the investment
