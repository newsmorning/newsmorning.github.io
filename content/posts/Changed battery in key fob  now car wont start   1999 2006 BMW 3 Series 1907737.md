Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When I Changed the Battery in My BMW 3 Series Key Fob!

Introduction:

As an owner of a BMW 3 Series, I experienced a moment of panic when my key fob stopped working. It was the first time it had happened, and I was unsure what had caused it. After some research, I found out that it was likely due to the battery being dead. What happened next was not what I expected, and perhaps it will surprise you too.

Body:

I purchased a replacement battery for my BMW 3 Series key fob and replaced it myself. I was eager to test it out, and to my surprise, the key fob would not respond at all. It was as if the battery was still dead. I tried everything, from pressing the buttons harder to moving closer to the car. Nothing seemed to work.

After a few more attempts, I decided to contact BMW customer service to see if they could help. The representative on the other end was friendly and helpful. She asked me a few questions, and we went through the process of trying to reprogram the key fob. Sadly, it did not work, and she informed me that I would need to take it to the dealership for repairs.

I was a bit disappointed but knew that I had no other option. I took it to the dealership, and after a few minutes of inspection, the technician informed me that the battery I had installed was not the correct one. He explained that the BMW 3 Series key fob requires a specific type of battery that is not commonly found in stores. I was a bit embarrassed, but at the same time relieved that it was not a more serious issue.

The technician replaced the battery, and the key fob worked perfectly. I was overjoyed and relieved to have resolved the issue. What surprised me the most was how particular the BMW 3 Series key fob is and how important it is to use the right type of battery.

Conclusion:

Changing the battery in my BMW 3 Series key fob was an unexpected experience. It taught me about the importance of using the proper battery and the unexpected issues that can arise from not doing so. If you ever find yourself needing to replace the battery in your key fob, make sure to do your research and use the right type of battery. Trust me; it will save you some headache in the long run.

## Chosen Solution
 Locksmiths say they can fix it then never show up. Afraid to ask dealership to fix because of how much it could cost, but it is probably less than buying a new car.  The car is 2005 BMW 325i with 150k miles.  EWS3 with aftermarket key fob.  Seems bonkers to me that changing a battery could cost me hundreds in repairs.  Is this what BMW does now?

 Hi @theosnames
Try programming the key fob and check if that works

 You lost the chip that talks to the security system. In aftermarket keys you have to program a chip with the same code as the original for it to work.
These chips aren't usually secured inside the key and can drop out if your not careful. It looks like a small piece of black plastic rectangular in shape. Open the key again and check. If you see a space similar then it's missing.

 Don't know about BMW key fobs, but my Toy fobs will start the car if I hold them next to the start button if the battery is dead.
Since this is an issue since you changed the battery, have you verified the LED lights when you push a button. If not the battery might be in backwards. It is also possible you got a bad battery. Happened to me once or twice.
