# Discover the Ultimate Hack: 5 Simple Ways to Get Rid of Pesky Windows 8 Metro UI for Good!

Are you tired of dealing with the Windows 8 Metro UI on your computer? Does it slow you down, interrupt your workflow, and make you feel disconnected from your work? If so, you're not alone. The Metro UI has been a controversial subject among Windows users, and it's understandable why.

Fortunately, there are ways to remove the Metro UI and restore the classic Windows desktop experience. In this article, we'll share five easy ways to get rid of the Metro UI for good.

## Method #1: Use a Third-Party Start Menu

Using a third-party start menu is the most popular and easiest way to remove the Metro UI in Windows 8. These tools add a traditional start menu to your desktop, allowing you to access your favorite programs and settings quickly.

One of the best third-party start menus for Windows 8 is Classic Shell. This tool is free, open-source, and highly customizable. You can choose from different start button styles, menu skins, and color schemes to make it look and feel the way you want.

## Method #2: Modify the Registry

If you're comfortable tinkering with the Windows Registry, you can also remove the Metro UI by modifying a few keys. Here's how:

1. Press Win+R to open the Run dialog box.

2. Type "regedit" and press Enter. This will open the Registry Editor.

3. Navigate to the following key: 
   ```

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
   Explorer\StartPage
   ```
   
4. Change the value of "OpenAtLogin" to "0."

5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

Note that modifying the Registry can be risky, and you should always back up your data before attempting it.

## Method #3: Use Group Policy

If you're running Windows 8 Pro or Enterprise, you can use the Group Policy Editor to disable the Metro UI. Here's how:

1. Press Win+R to open the Run dialog box.

2. Type "gpedit.msc" and press Enter. This will open the Group Policy Editor.

3. Navigate to the following location: 
   ```

   User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar
   ```

4. Double-click on "Remove the Start Menu" policy and select Enabled.

5. Click Apply and then OK.

6. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

## Method #4: Use PowerShell

If you prefer using command-line tools, you can use PowerShell to uninstall the Metro UI from your system. Here's how:

1. Press Win+X and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)."

2. Type the following command and press Enter: 
   ``` 

   Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage
   ```
   
3. Wait for the command to complete, and then restart your computer.

Note that this method will remove all built-in Windows 8 apps, including the Metro UI.

## Method #5: Upgrade to Windows 10

Finally, if you're fed up with the Metro UI and want a more traditional desktop experience, you can upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft has made significant improvements to the operating system's user interface, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.

To upgrade to Windows 10, simply follow these steps:

1. Press Win+I to open the Settings app.

2. Click on "Update & Security."

3. Click on "Windows Update."

4. Click on "Check for updates."

5. If an update to Windows 10 is available, click on "Download and install."

6. Follow the prompts to complete the upgrade process.

In conclusion, removing the Metro UI in Windows 8 may seem like a daunting task, but it's relatively simple if you know the right methods. Whether you choose to use a third-party tool, modify the Registry, use Group Policy, use PowerShell, or upgrade to Windows 10, you can enjoy a more traditional desktop experience without the pesky Metro UI getting in the way.

Not every user is a fan of Windows 8’s Metro UI. Users who are upgrading from previous versions of Windows aren’t happy with the new UI. The new Metro-style Start screen helps you search and launch apps faster. But unfortunately, many users are looking for a workaround to make Windows 8 Metro UI free!
 
Users who aren’t in love with Microsoft’s new user interface and apps can easily get rid of the UI by following some smart solutions given below.
 
1. Skip the Metro-style Start screen: Most of you hate to see the Start screen, right? Just skip it! While it’s not possible to completely disable the Start screen, you can follow our how to skip the Start screen guide to skip the Start screen while logging in. That is, whenever you login, you will see the desktop instead of the Start screen.
 









 
2. Add Start menu: If you aren’t going to use the Start screen, you must need the Start menu to search and launch programs. Just install either ViStart (Start menu for Windows) and Classic Shell for Windows 8 to get the Start menu.
 
3. Set legacy programs as default: By default in Windows 8, audio files open in the Metro music player, PDF files open in Reader, and pictures open Metro picture viewer. To make your favorite media player as the default program, simply right-click on an audio file, select Choose default programs and then select your media player as the default program. You can do the same for pictures and PDF files as well.
 
4. Disable Ribbon UI: Ribbon UI in Windows Explorer isn’t exactly the part of Metro. But if you like to disable the Ribbon Explorer and love to see the old toolbar, you can use the tool named Ribbon Disabler. You can use the same tool to revert to the original settings as well.
 
5. Uninstall Metro apps and disable Windows 8 Store: If you don’t like to see Metro-style apps in the Open with menu and other areas of the OS, you can easily uninstall Metro-style apps.
 
Just right-click on the app tile on the Start screen that you wish to uninstall and then select the Uninstall option. To avoid other users from installing Metro-style apps from the Store, you can disable or turn off the Windows 8 Store as well.
 
And for the record, I love Windows 8 and Metro UI.
