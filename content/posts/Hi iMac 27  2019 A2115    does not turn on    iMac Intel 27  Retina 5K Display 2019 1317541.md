Title: You Won't Believe What Happened to the iMac 27 2019 A2115 - Shocking Reason Why it Won't Turn On!

Subtitle: An Unexpected Turn of Events

Introduction:

Apple has been known for its premium quality and reliable products, but what if the unthinkable happens and your iMac 27 2019 A2115 suddenly won't turn on? It's a shocking experience for any user since an iMac, known for its sleek design and high-end features, costs quite a fortune. This article dives deep into the reasons why your iMac 27 2019 A2115 won't turn on and what you can do to fix it.

Body:

The first and foremost reason for an iMac 27 2019 A2115 that won't turn on is a power-related issue. It's imperative to check if your device is out of power or if the power cord is plugged in properly. Sometimes, a faulty power cord might be the culprit. So, try to replace the cord with a new one or check if you're using the original cord that came with the device. Additionally, you can also check if the power outlet is working correctly. Faulty power outlets or breakers can prevent your iMac from turning on.

A damaged display cable is also one of the reasons why your iMac 27 2019 A2115 won't turn on. The display cable connects your iMac's logic board to its screen. If this cable is damaged, worn out, or disconnected, you won't see any activity or hear any startup chime. You can check it by opening the iMac back panel and examining the state of the cable. If the cable looks okay, then it may be a logic board issue.

A faulty logic board, memory issue, or a failed CPU can also lead to an iMac 27 2019 A2115 that won't turn on. Unfortunately, it's difficult to pinpoint which component is causing the issue without running diagnostics. It's best to seek help from authorized Apple service centers if you suspect that your iMac has a hardware issue.

Finally, software issues can also prevent an iMac 27 2019 A2115 from turning on. Installing incompatible software, updating to an incompatible macOS, or a corrupted OS can cause your device to stop working abruptly. In this case, you can try booting your iMac in safe mode or perform a system restore from the Time Machine backup.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, an iMac 27 2019 A2115 that won't turn on can have several underlying reasons. While it's tempting to resolve the problem yourself, it's best to seek help from authorized Apple service centers to prevent further damage to your device. Keep in mind always to backup your data and ensure that your iMac's software and hardware are up to date. With proper care and maintenance, your iMac 27 2019 A2115 will last for years to come.

## Chosen Solution
 hi imac 27( 2019 A2115) - does not turn on! LED 2-3 is on
Please help - what does this mean?
diagnostic LEDs
1- of . 2-on. 3-on 4-of 5 -of
the fan sometimes spins slowly sometimes very quickly - the screen is black. There was a power surge

 What are the 5 diagnostic LEDs?
This is from the Apple service manual:
Diagnostic LEDs
LED 1 - Indicates that the trickle voltage from the power supply has been detected by the main logic board. This LED will turn on when you connect the iMac to a working AC power source. The
LED will remain on as long as the computer is on or asleep. When the computer has been shut down correctly, LED 1 behavior may differ:
If a startup event is scheduled in System Preferences/Energy Saver, then LED 1 will stay on after a correct shutdown.
If no startup event is scheduled in System Preferences/Energy Saver, then LED 1 will turn off and will stay off as long as the power cord is kept connected and an AC power source is present. Disconnecting the power cord and plugging it back in will turn this LED back on, even if the computer is still off.
After disconnecting and reconnecting the AC power source, this LED could remain off:
If the AC power source is missing or disconnected.
If the logic board is disconnected from the power supply or the AC receptacle.
If the power supply board is faulty.
LED 2 - Indicates that the computer is turned on. This LED will be on as long as the computer is turned on (but is not asleep) and the power supply and voltage regulators are working correctly.
LED 3 - Indicates that the logic board and GPU are communicating. This LED will be on when the CPU is communicating properly with the GPU. If LEDs 1 and 2 are on and LED 3 is off, then the backup battery (on the back of the logic board) may need to be reseated or the
logic board may need replacement.
LED 4 - Indicates that the logic board and LCD panel are communicating. This LED will be on when the computer is turned on and a video signal is being generated. If LED 4 is on and there is no image on the display, then the LCD panel or the cables between the LCD and logic board might be installed incorrectly or need replacement.
LED 5 - Indicates that the logic board and LCD panel are communicating. This LED is on when the computer is turned on, a video signal is being generated, and the LCD Panel is signaling to turn on the backlight. If LED 5 is ON and there is no image on the display, then the LCD backlight or circuitry on the logic board may be malfunctioning. The LCD panel or the cables or the logic board may need replacement.
—————-
LED Startup Sequence
LED 1 = Power is available. If no LED is visible:
Disconnect the power cord from the computer and wait 15 seconds to reset the power supply and LED status.
Reconnect the power cord and check the LED status again.
Verify the AC source.
Verify that a known-good power cord is connected. Verify the cable connection between the AC inlet and the power supply.
Verify the cable connection between the power supply and the logic board.
Verify the power supply.
LED 1 + LED 2 = Power is available and the system is turned on.
If the second LED is not visible when the power button is pressed:
Verify that the power button is connected to the power supply.
Verify power button functionality.
Verify the cable connection between the power supply and the logic board.
Verify the power supply. Verify the logic board.
LED 1 + LED 2 + LED 3 = Power is available, the system is turned on, and the GPU was found.
If the third LED is not visible after the system is turned on:
Verify whether the fan is running when turned on (reset SMC
and NVRAM, verify backup battery voltage for proper startup). If the fan is not heard, go to the "No Startup" troubleshooting flow.
LED 1 + LED 2 + LED 3 + LED 4 = Power is available, the system is turned on, the logic board is communicating with the GPU, and the internal LCD was found.
If the fourth LED is not visible after the system is turned on:
Verify the embedded DisplayPort cable (eDP) connections between the LCD panel and the logic board. Inspect the LCD display cables for cable damage.
Verify external video functionality and proceed according to the result:
If an external display works, verify/replace the LCD panel. If an external display does not work, verify/replace the logic board.
LED 1 + LED 2 + LED 3 + LED 4 + LED 5 = Power is available, system is turned on, GPU is working, logic board is communicating with the LCD panel, and the LCD panel has turned on the LCD backlight.
If the fifth LED is not visible after the computer is turned on:
Verify the eDP cable and backlight cable connections between the LCD panel and the logic board.
Inspect the LCD display cables for cable damage.
Using a flashlight, check the following areas on the panel:
Look in the top left corner of the panel to see if there is a dim Apple logo (the Apple menu logo).Look in the center of the panel to see if there is a login screen.Look at the bottom of the panel to see if there is a Dock visible.If the following items are visible, there maybe something wrong with the display cables or the logic board. Proceed to the next step.Replace the LCD panel, check that all the LED’s are visible, and that the backlight functions. If the computer does not function after replacing the LCD panel, replace the logic board.

 Did you manage to found the answer? I'm willing to change the power supply and test
