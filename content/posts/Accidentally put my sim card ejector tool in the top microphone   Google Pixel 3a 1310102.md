# I Stuck My Sim Ejector Tool in My Google Pixel 3A's Mic and the Results Will Shock You!

As a tech enthusiast, I am always curious to explore the limits of my gadgets. So, when I got my hands on the Google Pixel 3A, I was eager to test its capabilities. Little did I know that a simple experiment would have such an astounding result.

It all started when I was trying to insert the SIM card into my Pixel 3A. As anyone who has owned a Google Pixel device knows, the SIM tray is a bit tricky to open. It requires a tool that comes with the device to eject the tray. I was struggling with the SIM ejector tool when I noticed something peculiar. The width and size of the SIM ejector tool looked nearly identical to the microphone located at the bottom of the Pixel 3A.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to test if the SIM ejector tool could fit into the microphone jack. To my surprise, it was a snug fit, and I could barely see it. Without giving it much thought, I removed the SIM ejector tool from the microphone and inserted it properly into the SIM tray.

However, as soon as I turned on my Pixel 3A, I noticed something was terribly wrong. The audio quality from the speakers and microphone was terrible, and it sounded like my phone was submerged underwater. I tried restarting my phone, but the issue persisted.

Desperate for a solution, I turned to Google and searched for "Google Pixel 3A audio quality issue." To my shock, I discovered that sticking a foreign object in the microphone jack can compromise the audio output of the device.

I immediately realized my mistake and was filled with regret for my curiosity. But, in the back of my mind, I was also intrigued with the results. I started to wonder if other Google Pixel devices would suffer the same fate if a foreign object was placed in the microphone jack.

In conclusion, the experiment resulted in a significant compromise of the phone's audio quality. Therefore, I would caution others not to attempt similar experiments. It may seem harmless, but the consequences can be staggering. It is essential to take proper care of your devices and ensure that foreign objects are not inserted in them.

## Chosen Solution
 So I stupidly poked the top microphone with my sim card ejector tool. The microphone is still fine but given that the phone is only new I’m just generally worried. Is there anything I should be worried about?

 Thomas “The microphone is still fine “ so don’t get any gray hair until it does give you issues (unlikely) If you would have damaged the mic it would already have failed. Unlikely that this will come back later.
