# GandCrab Ransomware Victims Rejoice: Unlock Your Files Now with These Master Decryption Keys!

If you've had the unpleasant experience of falling victim to the notorious GandCrab ransomware, we have some good news for you: a master decryption key has been recently released, giving you the chance to unlock your files without paying a ransom to the cyber attackers.

But let's back up a bit and explain what GandCrab is and how it works. This strain of malware is a type of ransomware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. The first version of GandCrab appeared in early 2018 and since then multiple versions have been released, each one more sophisticated and harder to decrypt than the previous one.

GandCrab has been responsible for countless attacks on individuals, small businesses, and even large organizations. It's estimated that its creators have extorted millions of dollars from victims, making it one of the most lucrative ransomware campaigns in history.

But now, thanks to the collaboration between cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies, the reign of GandCrab is coming to an end. In June 2019, the FBI, Europol, and other international partners managed to seize the domain and infrastructure used by the GandCrab operators, effectively crippling the ransomware's distribution network.

In addition, the Romanian police arrested a suspect believed to be one of the masterminds behind GandCrab, and he reportedly cooperated with authorities by providing them with the decryption keys for all versions of the ransomware.

This means that if you've been infected by GandCrab, you might be able to recover your files without having to resort to paying a ransom. Here's how you can do it:

1. Identify the version of GandCrab that infected your system. You can do this by looking at the ransom note or the extension of the encrypted files. The master decryption key works for all versions of the ransomware.

2. Download the GandCrab decryption tool from the No More Ransom project, a joint initiative by law enforcement and private companies that seeks to combat ransomware. The tool is available for free and has been tested by experts.

3. Run the tool and follow the instructions. Make sure to create a backup of your encrypted files before attempting to decrypt them, as the process could fail or cause further damage.

4. If the decryption is successful, your files should be restored to their original state. If not, you might need to seek the assistance of a professional data recovery service or consider other options for data recovery.

While the release of the master decryption key is a significant victory against GandCrab and ransomware in general, it doesn't mean that the threat is completely eliminated. Cybercriminals will continue to create new variants and improve their tactics, so it's crucial to stay vigilant and take preventive measures to protect your data.

These measures include regular backups of your files, using up-to-date antivirus software, avoiding suspicious emails and websites, and educating yourself and your employees about the risks and best practices of cybersecurity.

In conclusion, if you're a victim of GandCrab ransomware, don't lose hope. With the master decryption key and the right tools and precautions, you can reclaim your files and prevent future attacks. Stay safe and secure online!

The master decryption keys for GandCrab ransomware are now available for all PC users. These keys can be used to decrypt GandCrab versions 4 to 5.2.
 
The keys are a lifesaver for those who are trying to decrypt their systems affected GandCrab attacks.
 
The FBI collaborated with the LEA agencies belonging to 8 different European Union countries to work on this project. Furthermore, Europol and the security solutions provider BitDefender worked with FBI to develop a tool that can decrypt the GandCrab malware.
 
BDAntiRansomware is an anti-ransomware tool from Bitdefender that can take anything you throw at it.
 
The GandCrab ransomware works similar to the way how other ransomware attacks operate these days. First, it encrypts all the files on the infected system.
 
Then the attackers demand a huge ransomware amount in order to decrypt your data. The attackers hold your data until the ransomware is transferred in cryptocurrency.
 
### The impact of GandCrab
 
GandCrab was first launched in 2018. If we look at the statistics, this ransomware attack has affected more than 500,000 PCs worldwide.
 
Surprisingly, the victims have paid more than $300 million dollars until now.
 
The FBI further describes that GandCrab has been developed based on a business model named “ransomware-as-a-service”.
 
It is worth mentioning that GandCrab licenses are sold to others. The developers who worked on the malware keep 40 percent of the ransomware amount.
 
Use these anti-hacking software solutions to block cyber attacks successfully.
 
Moreover, the rest of the 60 percent is kept by those who purchase licenses. The malware developers are earning millions by selling individual licenses on an annual basis.
 
Some Redditors think that the recent attack is more successful as compared to the previous WannaCry ransomware.
 
### GandCrab decryption keys
 
If you are one of those who are affected by GandCrab you can use the decryption keys published by the FBI.
 
wannacry also royally screwed itself over by using a hardcoded kill switch that literally anyone could flip, so it only spread for four days. Granted, it got 100k out of 200,000 infected in four days. Grancrab only had an estimated 50,000 infected after its first month, but it built up gradually and improved itself over time.
 
However, it is not yet clear how the federal security agency got access to the decryption keys.
