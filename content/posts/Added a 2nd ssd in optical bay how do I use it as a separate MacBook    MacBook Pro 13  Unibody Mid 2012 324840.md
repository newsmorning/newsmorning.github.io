# Double your MacBook's storage capacity with this simple trick - learn how to add a 2nd SSD in your optical bay!

If you're a MacBook user, you may sometimes find yourself running out of storage space. This can be frustrating, as it limits your ability to save new files, and can slow down your system as well. Fortunately, there is a simple trick that can help you double your MacBook's storage capacity. This trick involves adding a second SSD in your optical bay.

To start, you'll need a few things. First, you'll need a MacBook with an optical drive (i.e., a SuperDrive). Next, you'll need a second SSD. Finally, you'll need a hard drive caddy that fits your MacBook's optical drive slot.

Once you have all of these things, you can begin the process of adding the second SSD to your MacBook. Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Shut down your MacBook and unplug it from power.

Step 2: Remove the bottom case of your MacBook. This will give you access to the internal components of your MacBook.

Step 3: Remove the optical drive from your MacBook. To do this, you'll need to unscrew the screws that hold it in place, and then carefully slide it out of its slot.

Step 4: Insert the second SSD into the hard drive caddy. Make sure that it is securely in place.

Step 5: Insert the hard drive caddy into the optical drive slot of your MacBook. You may need to gently push it in until it clicks into place.

Step 6: Screw the hard drive caddy in place.

Step 7: Put the case back on your MacBook and screw it in place.

Step 8: Turn on your MacBook and wait for it to boot up.

Congratulations! You have now added a second SSD to your MacBook, effectively doubling its storage capacity.

There are a few things you should keep in mind when adding a second SSD to your MacBook. First, make sure that the hard drive caddy you purchase is compatible with your MacBook model. Second, be sure to purchase an SSD that has the same form factor as your primary SSD. This will help ensure that it fits properly in the hard drive caddy.

In conclusion, adding a second SSD to your MacBook is a simple and effective way to double its storage capacity. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily add a second SSD to your MacBook, and free up space for all your important files and documents. So why not give it a try and see how much more storage space you can gain?

## Chosen Solution
 I have a few questions related to this actually:
When I turn on my computer ever since I added the 2nd ssd in place of the optical drive, the computer gives off this loud fan sound for a few min, and then continues more softlyI cannot add or remove files in the 2nd ssd without having to enter my macbook passwordIs there any way I can use this second hard drive as a separate system altogether?

 It sounds like you transferred the drive from another system to this system. If that is the case you’ll need to correct the permissions of the drive by adding your user account to the other drive.
Click your systems primary drive from the desktop (having drives visible on the desktop) go to the Users and your active user folder with it selected. right click and select ‘Get Info’ that will allow you to see the permissions at the bottom under the twisty ‘Sharing & Permissions’ You should see your user account, now click on your second drive you likely won’t see your account listed this is where you need to add it. If you have multiple user folders on the second drive you’ll want to select the folder you want your user to have access and then alter it Vs the full drive.

 Does it start like normal? No delays or anythingthats a security issue. I have the same Macbook. I will check it and let you know.  (How did you format the second ssd?You mean dual boot. So when you start you want a screen where you can choose from what SSD you want to run MacOS. Both MacOS ?
