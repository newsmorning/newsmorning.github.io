# Unlock The Secrets To Thriving In Self Isolation: Discover The Top 8 Tech Ideas That Will Change Your Life!

Are you feeling bored and unproductive during self-isolation? Are you struggling to adapt to the new normal of staying at home? If so, don't fret! Technology has you covered. Here are the top 8 tech ideas to help you stay productive, entertained and connected during self-isolation. 

## 1. Virtual Hangouts

Just because you can't see your friends and family in person doesn't mean you can't hang out with them. With apps like Zoom, Skype, and Houseparty, you can host virtual hangouts and stay connected. You can even try playing games together like charades or Pictionary. 

## 2. Online Learning

What better way to use your free time than by learning something new? With websites like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy, you can take courses in anything from coding to marketing to psychology. Many universities are also offering free courses during this time, so it's a great opportunity to level up your skills.

## 3. Meditation Apps

Maintaining mental health during uncertain times is crucial. Meditation apps like Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer offer guided meditations to help you relax and focus. Some even offer specific meditations for dealing with anxiety and stress.

## 4. Video Games

Video games offer a great way to escape reality and keep your mind active. There are plenty of options out there, whether you prefer action-packed games like Call of Duty or more laid-back options like Animal Crossing. Online multiplayer games like Fortnite and Minecraft offer the chance to play with friends and meet new people virtually. 

## 5. Online Workout Classes

With gyms closed and outdoor exercise limited, staying active can be a challenge. Thankfully, many fitness studios and personal trainers are offering online classes for free or at a reduced rate. Gympass, Peloton, and ClassPass all offer access to various classes with different trainers, so you can mix it up and find what works for you.

## 6. Virtual Museum Tours

If you miss visiting art museums and galleries, never fear. Many museums around the world are now offering virtual tours, so you can explore exhibits and collections from the comfort of your own couch. The British Museum, the Louvre, and the National Gallery of Art are just a few that you can visit online.

## 7. Online Shopping

Online shopping may sound like a cliché, but it's a great way to support small businesses and try new products while stuck at home. Many retailers are also offering discounts and free shipping during this time. Just be sure to shop responsibly and avoid overspending if money is tight.

## 8. Virtual Book Clubs

Reading is a great way to escape and expand your mind, but it's even better when you have someone to discuss the book with. With platforms like Goodreads, you can join virtual book clubs or start your own. You can even connect with authors and ask them questions about their work.

In Conclusion

Self-isolation doesn't have to be a time of boredom and isolation. With these tech ideas, you can stay productive, entertained, and connected with others. So, pick one or two to try out today and start thriving in your new normal.

Self isolation can have serious consequences on a person’s mental well-being. Whether as an introvert purposely distancing ourselves from social interaction, or being forced into it due to a quarantine or lockdown, the damage to our psyche could lead to severe psychological complications.
 
Even if we feel that dealing with other people can be irritating at times, humans are hardwired to interact with others. Thankfully, technology may bridge the gap between social interaction and self isolation.
 
Maintaining communication with others is important. Below, we’ve provided a few ways that technology can be used to combat the issues that come with social distancing and self isolation.
 

 
## 8 Best Tech Ideas To Cope With Self Isolation
 
There are plenty of different things we can do to cope with self isolation and social distancing that will keep us sane. We no longer need to be in the same room or country as someone in order to engage socially with them.
 
Here are a few things we can do that will help us pass the time during a period of physical social exodus.
 
#### Make A Phone Call
 
Let’s start with something simple. Living in the days of email and text, which are also good options for social interaction during isolation, we often forget that our phone’s primary function is to make calls. We’ve gotten so used to using our phones for YouTube videos and social media, that making a call to convey our thoughts can sometimes feel awkward. 
 
Sometimes, the sound of a friend or family member’s voice is all we really need to get through a trying time. Don’t be afraid to reach out with a phone call every once in a while. We might be surprised by the results.
 
#### Use Social Media
 
The use of social media is widespread the world over. We’d be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t have at least one account on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter these days.
 
As toxic as these cesspools of ignorance and vanity can become, we’re likely to find friends and family on these platforms. This makes it much easier to keep in touch and converse on a daily basis. Text doesn’t always convey the proper tone in a message, but with the help of photos and video, we can make things clearer with an upload.
 
Speaking of uploads…
 
#### Record A Video Or Live Stream
 
Times of self isolation and social distancing are perfect for getting our YouTube and Twitch careers up and running. Grab a decent webcam and microphone, and get to work on our craft. Not only does the creative process provide plenty of work to occupy our time, but the social aspect is there as well. 
 
After posting a video, there’s still the comments section to read, where we can actively engage with our followers. The same can be said for the live chat available on the Twitch platform. Staying active and consistent will see viewership soar to new heights.
 
#### Play A Video Game
 
Gaming can be a great source of fun when we’re unable to get outside. Online game library platforms like Steam and EpicGames allow us to purchase and play top titles by downloading them to our PC. Console gaming is also an option if we have a stack of games we’ve been allowing to pile up untouched.
 
We can make social connections with online games by getting a group of friends together using the in-game chat provided, if available, or third-party VoIP software such as Discord, TeamSpeak3, and Mumble.
 
#### Join An Online Chat Group
 
There are other ways of chatting within a group online. Something as simple as setting up a Google Hangout, Skype call, or FaceTime could achieve the same effect. 
 
Set aside time with a friend, or group of friends, to get online and chat, and turn it into an online party. Website chat groups like Google Groups and InstaChatRooms are also available.
 
For those who prefer an indirect approach, there are plenty of online forums to throw our two cents. They’re also a great place to discover other people interested in a similar niche. Google search a hobby or topic and look for a forum where it’s discussed.
 
#### Shared-Screen Movie Nights
 
Sticking with the VoIP theme, utilizing the screen-share feature from platforms like Skype, Discord, and Zoom could help us set up a night of cinema or a full day of binge watching our favorite shows on Netflix with a friend or family member. 
 
The person who’s hosting the movies will need to be the screen everyone connects to. We’ll be able to laugh, cry, and discuss what just happened in The Walking Dead while not even being in the same room.
 
#### TV Dongles And Subscription Services
 
#### eBooks and Audiobooks
 
Another thing we could get absorbed in during a lengthy period of self isolation is a good book. Yes, people still read more than just blog articles and Twitter feeds. High-fantasy, science-fiction, history, crime-thriller, drama. No matter our preferred interest, there’s a book out there that will capture our attention.
 
There’s something about holding an actual book in our hands that just feels right. The feel of the spine, turning each page using our own fingers, the weight, the smell. It’s something we can’t experience with an eBook or audiobook. However, self isolation usually means that there’s no running out to the store to purchase that newly released paperback. So, these will have to do.
 
Hopefully, as cities and businesses open back up, we’ll all be able to reduce our reliance on tech and go back to meeting and hanging out with people in person. Until then, get faster internet to handle all of these online activities!
