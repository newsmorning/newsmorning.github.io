Elden Ring, the upcoming action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and co-created by Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin, has been on the hype radar ever since its announcement at E3 2019. The game promises to offer a grand adventure in a world of mythology and dark fantasy, filled with iconic bosses, intricate lore, and thrilling combat. And one of the most exciting aspects of the game is the massive variety of weapons and equipment you can use to slay orcs, demons, dragons, and other formidable foes.\nAmong the weapons, axes hold a special place, as they are often associated with brute strength, heavy damage, and satisfying swings. In Elden Ring, axes come in all shapes and sizes, from small hatchets to giant two-handed monsters that can cleave through stone and steel. And in this article, we’ll showcase some of the most impressive and awe-inspiring axes we’ve seen so far in Elden Ring. Get ready to be amazed!\n1. The Stone-Crushing Axe of Hraesvelgr Hraesvelgr is one of the hardest bosses in Elden Ring, a monstrous bird of prey that can summon storm clouds and hurl lightning bolts. To defeat him, you’ll need a weapon that can crush his thick feathers and pierce his armored scales. And that’s where the Stone-Crushing Axe of Hraesvelgr comes in. This axe is not only gigantic and heavy, but also has a chain attached to its head, allowing you to swing it like a flail and smash your enemies into submission.\n2. The Ice-Forged Axe of Ymir Ymir is a legendary giant of Norse mythology, known for his immense strength and magical powers. In Elden Ring, you’ll encounter Ymir as a boss, and you’ll need to overcome his icy attacks and formidable stamina. To do so, you may want to wield the Ice-Forged Axe of Ymir, a massive weapon made of pure ice and imbued with frost powers. Not only does this axe deal massive damage to enemies weak to ice, but it also slows down their movements and lowers their defense, making them easy targets for follow-up attacks.\n3. The Winged Axe of Harpyia Harpyia is a winged demon that preys on humans and delights in their screams. She can fly high above and swoop down to attack you with her razor-sharp talons and piercing screeches. To counter her aerial threats, you’ll need a weapon that can reach her height and strike her from afar. The Winged Axe of Harpyia is just the tool for the job. This axe has a pair of wings attached to its back, allowing you to throw it like a boomerang and hit enemies in mid-air. The axe also deals bonus damage to flying enemies and can knock them down to the ground, leaving them vulnerable to combo attacks.\n4. The Fire-Brandished Axe of Salamandra Salamandra is a dragon that dwells in the deepest cave of Elden Ring, guarding a treasure hoard that would make even Smaug envious. To face her flames and cut through her scales, you’ll need a weapon that can withstand heat and deliver explosive force. The Fire-Brandished Axe of Salamandra is the tool of choice for this task. This axe is made of volcanic rock and enchanted with fire, making it resistant to fire damage and able to deal fire damage to enemies. The axe also has a special ability that allows you to charge it up and release a fiery blast that can stun enemies and set them on fire.\n5. The Sun-Crowned Axe of Apollo Apollo is a god of light and music, known for his radiance and eloquence. In Elden Ring, you’ll encounter him as a patron of a hidden shrine, where he tests your faith and rewards your courage. To prove your worthiness and win his favor, you’ll need a weapon that can reflect his brilliance and power. The Sun-Crowned Axe of Apollo is the ultimate weapon for this purpose. This axe has a golden blade and a gem-encrusted hilt, shining like the sun itself. The axe also has a special ability that allows you to absorb sunlight and convert it into raw power, increasing your damage and speed for a short time.\nThese are just five examples of the many awe-inspiring axes you can find in Elden Ring. From flaming hammers to thundering mauls, from poisonous sickles to enchanted halberds, the game has a vast array of weapons to suit any playstyle and taste. Whether you want to hack and slash your way through hordes of enemies or deal devastating blows to bosses, Elden Ring has something for you. So, get ready to venture into a world of wonder and danger, armed with your trusty axe, and join the epic quest for the Elden Ring!\nIf you are an Axe user, then there are 3 Colossal axes in Elden Ring. These weapons are very useful if you are going for a Strength build, since all of them have their own perks. Thus to help you pick which to use we have listed all of them below. And even added a Greataxe that you could use while you get any of the other ones. So here is a list of all colossal axes in Elden Ring.\nAll Colossal Axes List in Elden Ring There are mainly 3 Colossal Axes in Elden Ring and they are:\nDuelist Greataxe Rotten Greataxe Axe of Godfrey Aside from the above weapons, we can also consider the Axe of Godrick in this list. Though it is not a Colossal weapon rather a Greataxe. But due to its nature, it can be considered as one.\nDuelist Greataxe Starting with the weapon that gives the highest physical damage not only in Colossal axes but even when you compare it to every Colossal weapon in the game. Here is what you should know about it:\nPhysical damage: 170 Critical damage: 100 Weapon Skill: Endure You can change the above skill using Ashes of War. You can also buff this weapon with magic and consumables. Stats needed to use it:\nStrength: 30 Dexterity: 10 Location: Can be dropped by Duelist enemies near the West Capital Rampart Site of Grace.\nRotten Greataxe – Best Colossal Axe in Elden Ring This weapon has slightly lower damage than Duelist Greataxe. But while it may suffer a bit there, it compensates for it with its passive: Scarlet Rot buildup. Here are its stats:\nPhysical damage: 162 Critical damage: 100 Weapon Skill: Endure You can change the above skill using Ashes of War. Stats needed to use it:\nLocation: Defeat the Rotten Duelist enemy to get it as a drop from them.\nAxe of Godfrey This is a strong weapon that you get fairly late in the game. Here are its stats:\nPhysical damage: 165 Critical damage: 100 Weapon Skill: Regal Roar You cannot change the above skill using any Ashes of War. Here are the stats you need for using it:\nStrength: 42 Dexterity: 14 Location: Trade the Remembrance of Hoarah Loux to Enia at Roundtable Hold to get Axe of Godfrey.\nAxe of Godrick Again this is a Greataxe and not a Colossal weapon but its stat requirements and natures are similar to that of a Colossal weapon. The best thing about this weapon is that you can get it quite early in the game. Here are its stats:\nPhysical damage: 142 Critical damage: 100 Weapon Skill: I Command Thee, Kneel! You cannot change the above weapon skill using any Ashes of War. You need these stats to use it:\nStrength: 34 Dexterity: 22 Location: Trade the Remembrance of the Grafted to Enia at Roundtable Hold to get Axe of Godick.\nThat covers this guide on the list of all Colossal axes in Elden Ring. I suggest you also check our list of all Colossal weapons and where to find every colossal weapon in the game.\n","wordCount":"1322","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Keith Donaldson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/list-of-every-colossal-axe-in-elden-ring-714697/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"News Morning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://newsmorning.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/ accesskey=h title="News Morning (Alt + H)"><img src=https://newsmorning.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>News Morning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://newsmorning.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe How Many Colossal Axes Are Hiding in Elden Ring - Our Epic List Revealed!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 2, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1322 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Keith Donaldson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-the-stone-crushing-axe-of-hraesvelgr>1.
