Upgrading your motherboard can increase the speed of your laptop allowing you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously without experiencing any lagging issues.

Furthermore, upgrading your motherboard will ensure that your laptop is compatible with the latest hardware parts, such as RAMs and SSDs, which can significantly improve data processing speed and enhance your user experience.

How to Upgrade Your Motherboard

## Chosen Solution
 How do I change the motherboard on my gateway laptop to a gaming one? and if i am not able to how do i change the mother board on it to a windows 10 mother board with more space and memory

 Isaac Hicks you really cannot change the motherboard to something much better. What you can do is to increase Ram and replace the HDD with an SSD. You did not tell us the specs of your computer etc. but it appears as if this was marketed as a budget laptop and really not a gaming laptop. You may have to consider selling this one and take that money toward a gaming laptop.
