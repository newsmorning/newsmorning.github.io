# Stop Losing Money on Equipment! Learn the Shocking Truth About Depreciation and Boost Your Bottom Line Today!

When running a business, one of the major investments that you will make is buying equipment. Whether it is a manufacturing company, an engineering firm, or a restaurant, every business needs some sort of equipment to operate. However, most business owners are unaware of the effect of depreciation on their equipment investments. Depreciation can cause a significant loss of money, which can directly affect the profitability of your business. In this article, we will discuss the truth about depreciation and how you can boost your bottom line by taking steps to mitigate its impact on your business.

## What is Depreciation?

Depreciation is the reduction of an asset's value over time. It is the loss of value that occurs due to usage, wear and tear, and obsolescence. When you buy equipment, it is considered an asset on your balance sheet. The value of this asset is what you paid for it, but as time passes, the value of the equipment decreases. This decrease is the depreciation of the equipment. For example, if you buy a machine for $10,000 and it has an expected useful life of 10 years, the annual depreciation would be $1,000.

## The Impact of Depreciation on Your Business

Depreciation has a significant impact on your business's profitability. When the value of your equipment reduces, it lowers the overall value of your assets. This reduction in value has a direct impact on your balance sheet and can affect your financial statements. Depreciation also affects your tax liability, as it lowers your taxable income. However, if you are not keeping track of your equipment's depreciation, you could be missing out on tax savings.

Another impact of depreciation is the need for equipment replacement. As equipment depreciates, it becomes less efficient and reliable. This leads to increased maintenance costs and decreased productivity. Eventually, you may need to replace the equipment, which will require a significant investment. If you are not prepared for this cost, it can significantly impact your bottom line.

## How to Mitigate the Impact of Depreciation

Now that you understand the impact of depreciation, it's essential to take steps to mitigate its impact on your business. Here are a few ways to do that:

### 1. Keep Accurate Records

To accurately track your equipment's depreciation, you need to keep accurate records. You should keep a record of the equipment's purchase price, expected useful life, and any repairs or maintenance costs. By doing so, you can calculate the equipment's annual depreciation and ensure that you are taking advantage of all the tax savings.

### 2. Regular Maintenance

Regular maintenance can help extend the life of your equipment and reduce the need for replacement. By keeping your equipment in good condition, you can also reduce the cost of repairs and improve its efficiency. This can help you avoid the need for costly replacements and reduce the overall impact of depreciation.

### 3. Proper Disposal

When it comes to disposing of your equipment, it's important to do it properly. If you are not disposing of your equipment in compliance with environmental regulations, it can result in fines or penalties. Proper disposal can also help you receive some value from your equipment rather than just throwing it away.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, depreciation is a significant factor that affects your business's profitability. By keeping accurate records, performing regular maintenance, and properly disposing of your equipment, you can mitigate the impact of depreciation on your business. Taking these steps can help you increase your bottom line and improve the overall financial health of your business.

## What is Depreciation On Equipment?
 
### Explanation
 
Equipment in accounting refers to assets that are used in day-to-day business operations. Every piece of equipment bought is used over certain years, leading to a decrease in its value. Any office Equipment like devices and other tools bought at a cost cannot be sold at the same price as it has been used. Hence every year, the same or different percentage of amount is deducted from the value of an asset. This amount, which is deducted, is called the depreciationDepreciationDepreciation is a systematic allocation method used to account for the costs of any physical or tangible asset throughout its useful life. Its value indicates how much of an asset’s worth has been utilized. Depreciation enables companies to generate revenue from their assets while only charging a fraction of the cost of the asset in use each year.

### How to Depreciate Equipment?
 
To depreciate the equipment, you must know the following:
 
- Cost Value: Original price or purchase price of the asset.Salvage Value: Salvage valueSalvage ValueSalvage value or scrap value is the estimated value of an asset after its useful life is over. For example, if a company's machinery has a 5-year life and is only valued $5000 at the end of that time, the salvage value is $5000.read more is the resale value based on the market.Book Value: Cost value minus resale value is book value.A Lifetime of Equipment: Prediction of this is basis the market research, or mostly the government provides a list of life span for each vehicle or equipment.Method of Depreciation: This is generally decided by the management and calculated until the life span of the asset

 
### How to Calculate Depreciation on Equipment?
 
Depreciation is calculated using four ways which are discussed below:
 
- Straight Line MethodStraight Line MethodStraight Line Depreciation Method is one of the most popular methods of depreciation where the asset uniformly depreciates over its useful life and the cost of the asset is evenly spread over its useful and functional life. read moreWritten down value MethodWritten Down Value MethodThe Written Down Value method is a depreciation technique that applies a constant rate of depreciation to the net book value of assets each year, resulting in more depreciation expenses recognized in the early years of the asset's life and less depreciation recognized in the later years of the asset's life.read moreUnits of productions MethodUnits Of Productions MethodUnit of production depreciation is an activity method to ascertain asset value through its usage. It is evaluated as the multiplication of depreciation rate per unit and units produced per year, where depreciation per unit is the asset's cost minus salvage value divided by a particular year's production units.read moreSum of the year digits MethodSum Of The Year Digits MethodThe sum of years digits method is an accelerated depreciation method whereby the method declines the asset's value at an accelerated rate. Therefore, greater deductions are allowed in the starting life of the assets than in subsequent years.read more

 
#### #1 – Straight Line Method
 
In this method, the same amount is deducted as depreciation. The calculation of the depreciation amount happens after deducting the salvage value. The depreciation cost is evenly spread each year until the asset’s life.
 
#### #2 – Written Down Value Method
 
This method calculates depreciation on the cost after deducting the depreciation on each year of an asset; such value is known as Book value. This method can also be referred to as the diminishing or reducing balance method.
 
#### #3 – Units of Production Method
 
It is considered the best method as it is depreciated based on the number of units of machinery produced in the year than how many years machinery is used; as the production increases, depreciation will also be more and vice versa.
 
#### #4 – Sum of Year Digits Method
 
This method is based on the sum of an asset’s entire life; this results in a higher amount of depreciation in the initial years and lesser in later years. If machinery is used for three years, the SOYD depreciation will be [3+2+1 = 6], first-year depreciation will be 3/6,2nd year will be 2/6, and last year will be 1/6.
 
### Examples of Depreciation on Equipment
 
The following are examples of depreciation on equipment.
 
#### Example #1 – Straight Line Method (SLM)
 
Let’s consider the cost of equipment is $100,000, and if its life value is three years and if its salvage value is $40,000, the depreciation value will be calculated as below.
 
- Depreciation = $100,000 – $40,000Book Value = $ 60,000Value of Depreciation = $60,000/3 = $20,000

 
Depreciation for each year will be $20,000 in SLM of Depreciation.
 
#### Example #2 – Sum of Years Digit Method (SOYD)
 
Consider the same example in the SOYD method.
 
- Sum of year Digits will be = 3years = 3+2+1 =6Depreciation for 1st yr = $60,000*3/6 = $30,0002nd year = $60,000- $30,000 = $30,000*2/6 = $10,0003rd year = $30,000- $ 10,000 = $ 20,000*1/6 = $3,333

 
In SOYD of each year, depreciation will differ, and initial depreciation will be more compared to consecutive years.
