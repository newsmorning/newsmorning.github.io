## Chosen Solution
 I have found a blue ray drive that states it fits E5-571 and E5-571G models but I have a E5-571P model.  Will this drive work for my model as well?

 Hi Patrick French 
If your current laptop has a optical drive,
and yes, you can do a swap.
System should detect the new optical drive.
Eject the current drive trayPower Off the laptopUnscrew the optical drive screw, normally held by one screw.Pull out the drive, by holding on the ejected traycheck if there are any rail brackets, if so remove and transfer to the new drive.install the new drive and screw to hold it.power on and test.
