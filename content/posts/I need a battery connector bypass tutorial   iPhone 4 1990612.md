Have you ever been out and about, immersed in your daily activities, only to find that your iPhone 4 battery is dying on you? This is a common problem that affects many of us. It can be frustrating to constantly keep an eye on the battery percentage and search for an outlet to charge your device.

Fortunately, a new solution has emerged to help iPhone 4 users avoid this issue. With this connector bypass tutorial, you can unlock the secret to never running out of battery on your iPhone 4.

The first step is to understand the problem. Your iPhone 4 has a built-in charging circuitry that regulates the charging process. When you charge your device using the official charger, this circuitry works perfectly fine. However, when you use a third-party charger or a USB port on your computer, the circuitry can cause problems.

These charging problems can occur due to lack of communication between the iPhone and the charging source. The iPhone requires a specific voltage and amperage to charge properly. When this is not met, it causes the charging circuitry to malfunction and the battery to drain.

The solution to this problem is to bypass the charging circuitry entirely. This can be done by using a modified USB cable, which removes the signal pins and allows for a direct connection between the charging source and the iPhone 4 battery.

To create a modified USB cable, you will need a few tools including a USB cable, a sharp knife or razor blade, and a soldering iron. Begin by cutting the cable in half and removing the insulation to expose the wiring. Then, locate the red and black wires and cut the remaining wires. Strip the insulation off both the red and black wires, and solder them together. Finally, wrap the exposed wires with electrical tape to protect them.

Now, you have a modified USB cable that can bypass the charging circuitry on your iPhone 4. Simply connect your device to the USB port on your computer or a third-party charger using the modified cable, and your battery will begin to charge without any issues.

In conclusion, running out of battery on your iPhone 4 can be a frustrating experience. However, with this connector bypass tutorial, you can unlock the secret to never running out of battery again. By following these simple steps, you can create a modified USB cable that allows for a direct connection between your charging source and iPhone 4 battery. Say goodbye to battery anxiety and never have to worry about running out of battery again!

## Chosen Solution
 I am looking for anyone with any info on how to EXACTLY walk me through a battery connector bypass. Either, using bypass wires or another method. Any way that's most effective. I am not interested in sending my phone to someone, or interested in a person telling me that his/her shop sees that all the time and can fix it for me. Can anyone help me? I have a soldering kit and some soldering experience.

 Caleb, bridge the points with the smallest wire you can find and use the image as a guide. Reroute any wire so that they are not in the way with the re-assembly. Take a look at  this video as well as on here. Both videos show it very well. Hope this helps, good luck.
