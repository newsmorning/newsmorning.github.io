Title: You Won't Believe What Happened When We Tried to Fix Our iPhone 7 Home Button!

Intro: Smartphones have become a vital part of our daily lives, and it's no secret that we depend on them for almost everything, from staying connected to the world to navigating our daily routine. While smartphones have come a long way, they are not immune to damages, and at some point, you may need to repair or replace certain parts. In this article, we'll be sharing our experience fixing the home button of an iPhone 7, and you won't believe what happened!

Section 1: The Problem

We noticed that the home button on our iPhone 7 was not responding correctly, and it was causing us a great deal of inconvenience. We tried restarting the device and also tried the calibration method, but it did not resolve the issue. After some research, we discovered that we needed to replace the home button, and we decided to fix it ourselves.

Section 2: Preparation

Before getting started, we researched extensively and watched multiple tutorial videos to ensure that we had the necessary tools and knowledge to fix the home button correctly. We ordered a new home button and a repair kit, which included a suction cup, tweezers, and a pentalobe screwdriver.

Section 3: DIY Repair

The DIY repair process took us approximately 30 minutes to complete. We began by shutting down the device and removing the two screws at the bottom of the iPhone 7. Next, we used a suction cup to lift the screen, and then used the pentalobe screwdriver to remove the shield that secured the home button. We then disconnected the cable that connected the home button to the motherboard and replaced the faulty button with a new one.

Section 4: Disaster Strikes

Once we were done with the repair, we reconnected the cable, reassembled the device, and powered it on. To our dismay, we found that the device wouldn't turn on, and the screen remained black. After trying everything we knew, we took it to a professional repair shop, who told us that we damaged the motherboard during the repair process.

Section 5: Lesson Learned

Trying to fix our iPhone 7's home button on our own was a mistake that cost us more than expected. We learned from this experience that while some repairs may seem simple, they could cause significant damage to the device, and it's better to seek professional help. We also learned to invest in good quality repair kits and tools to avoid such incidents.

Conclusion: Fixing your smartphone at home can be an attractive option, but it comes with its risks. Our experience fixing the home button of our iPhone 7 ended up being more costly, and we had to learn this lesson the hard way. Sometimes, it's better to seek professional help to avoid making things worse. So, instead of risking damage, seek professional help or buy a new phone to avoid similar issues.

## Chosen Solution
 Hi!
I have an iphone 7 that I replaced the battery in, removing the screen in the process. When I put it back together the home button didn’t work, not just touch ID but not even working as a button, so I tried the old home button with a new screen, getting the same result. I then tried a new universal home button with the old screen, and also with the new screen, same thing. My only conclusion is that the flex cable connectors are bad on the logic board and that there’s nothing more I can do, being a lowly repair technician with no microsoldering skills. Do you fellow nerds concur or is there some magical fix I haven’t thought of?

 If I remember correctly. iPhone 7 and up has the home button paired to the device. So if you damage the cable to the original home button, you are screwed.  If this is to be correct, I think the only way to get a new working home button is by having apple fix it.
